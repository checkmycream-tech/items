            <li>So keeping that in mind, I think this shampoo does a great job and for the price/quantity/quality, you really can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>I have used several brands of hair shampoo over the years but Matrix is the best ever for me.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>And it is safe for color treated hair.  </li>

            <li>Glad didnt purchase.</li>
            <li>I have used this shampoo for many years and will buy again when needed.</li>
            <li>I love this product:&lt;br /</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had so many people ask \\&quot;did you color your hair again?\\</li>
            <li>I love all of the biolage brand.  </li>

            <li>Great for us old guys that dye our hair...</li>
            <li>free to comment or ask questions &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>It is gentle as promised so that&#x27;s good too.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much to work up a good lather.  </li>
            <li>Even freshER scent at economical price, excellent shampoo for color-treated hair, only shampoo I use !!!  </li>
            <li>Very good shampoo for dry hair.</li>
            <li>The shampoo works fine</li>
            <li>This is solid, salon quality shampoo for a great price.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product, definitely keeps the color in your hair for a longer amount of time.  </li>
            <li>Cheap shampoo dries out your scalp, thus, your hair.  </li>
            <li>It really preserves my color and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>I bought the huge liter bottle, and she&#x27;s right!</li>
            <li>This shampoo smells so great and my hair actually feels clean and fresh after use.</li>
            <li>and my hair feels really clean</li>
            <li>light and fresh.</li>
            <li>It seems to be gentle and hold color and shine better, My scalp did itch some with it</li>
            <li>That means your hair has a lot of build up and product on your hair if the shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather good, the 2nd shampoo should remove all of the build up!</li>
            <li>It is economical and leaves your hair exceptionally clean.</li>
            <li>I love everything about this shampoo except the high cost.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased to find this product sold in a larger container for such a great price on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>I have used this for several years and it keeps my hair very healthy.  </li>
            <li>It is easy on the scalp and gentle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth a try.</li>
            <li>well worth the price.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey but worth it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice to finally find a shampoo that works!</li>
            <li>but I decided to treat my teenage daughter with some nice shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I am addicted; I love the scent and my hair looks great after using this.</li>
            <li>I have to use twice as much to get my hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li>Very gentle to color treated hair when paired with the cream rinse.  </li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried the Biolage color care product.  </li>
            <li>In fact,.this is the only shampoo that I use since started coloring my hair many years ago.</li>
            <li>I gave this shampoo five stars because it is a high-quality shampoo which does exactly what it says - it minimizes fading.  </li>
            <li>Rating it higher than Prell however.</li>
            <li>I first bought this in salons.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many shampoos but I always go back to this!</li>
            <li>Silky soft and frizz free.</li>
            <li>I use it daily and love that it shows up on my doorstep as scheduled with its friend conditioner.</li>
            <li>but I will update on what happens when I straighten it later on:)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Matrix for years, and it usually has a great, floral smell and works very well.</li>
            <li>So I bought her favorite shampoo and in the extra large size that saves money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much gentler on my fine highlighted hair but still gets it very clean and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li>I am a long time user of Biolage products and I love the shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li>Not sure how good it does to protect the color yet but</li>
            <li>I use dry shampoo in between washes, so I am sure this helps hold my color.</li>
            <li>Purchased this large size on Amazon while I still had some Matrix Biolage shampoo from the salon.</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner were very drying.  </li>
            <li>Elderly, with very crippling arthritis in both hands</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to struggle so much.</li>
            <li>The combination of these two products gives me very mangeable and beauty hair.</li>
            <li>It has way too much fragrance (it took my breath away and coughing for a min.) and gave my hair greasy feel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on my hair, yet it really cleans it!&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Its just ok, but I prefer the hydrating formulas over this one, I like to color my hair and also have lots of curls, and I live in a dry climate.</li>
            <li>Most other products cause sores on my scalp,this does not.</li>
            <li>I also use other Biolage by Matrix hair products as well :-)</li>
            <li>This recent bottle that I bought was horrendous - my hair doesn&#x27;t feel clean and the fragrance of the product is not what it normally is.  </li>
            <li>Love this shampoo have thin fine hair.</li>
            <li>This is one of the few shampoos I&#x27;ve used where you can actually smell how good your hair smells after you shower.</li>
            <li>I use to color my hair and that was the main reason I started using it</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it,</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommended for all hair types .</li>
            <li>I love ordering these from Amazon as they are delivered right to my door within a day or two and are priced LESS than they are at my local CVS.</li>
            <li>It rinses clean but doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years with no complaint.  </li>
            <li>Bought the small bottle first to make sure that frequent use would not cause my scalp to be unbearably itchy, not yet anyway.</li>
            <li>I will definitely keep repurchasing this, it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an investment to go to a salon and have the highlights done every few months, so I want to keep my hair looking good as long as I can.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll occasionally use Chi Helmet head hairspray and this shampoo is strong enough to wash it out well</li>
            <li>, it is just that my hair feels super dry after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>This is the first time ordering shampoo from Amazon and probably my last.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.</li>
            <li>I previously used a cheap shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell, but this shampoo is average compared to others at the same price.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a clear shampoo</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with this product.</li>
            <li>This shampoo always makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>seems to work well &amp; leaves my hair really soft.</li>
            <li>I used this shampoo awhile back really don&#x27;t know why I stopped  </li>
            <li>oh my god my hair feels so soft and supple in the shower</li>
            <li>This Amazon version does not seem as thick or concentrated,  and it may strip my hair more than the salon version.</li>
            <li>I can use a little and get a lot of clean.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to help make your keratin treatment last longer.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a long list of products but those have left my hair with too much residue.</li>
            <li>And it last long cause you don&#x27;t have to use so much of it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used multiple products over the years - everything from VO5 on sale for .79 to Profound from my salon at $125/bottle.  </li>
            <li>My hair is not dry, anymore.  </li>
            <li>I guess I am naïve in thinking that if I order Biolage shampoo then that is what I&#x27;ll get - not a very poor imitation in a Biolage bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other supposed color safe shampoos and all they did was leave my hair limp and not very clean.  </li>
            <li>(you can read my previous reviews on it if you&#x27;re interested in dry shampoo).</li>

            <li> It seems to be gentle and hold color and shine better, My scalp did itch some with it</li>
            <li> That means your hair has a lot of build up and product on your hair if the shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather good, the 2nd shampoo should remove all of the build up!</li>
            <li> It is economical and leaves your hair exceptionally clean.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this shampoo except the high cost.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased to find this product sold in a larger container for such a great price on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I have used this for several years and it keeps my hair very healthy.  </li>
            <li> It is easy on the scalp and gentle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth a try.</li>
            <li> well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey but worth it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nice to finally find a shampoo that works!</li>
            <li> but I decided to treat my teenage daughter with some nice shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I am addicted; I love the scent and my hair looks great after using this.</li>
            <li> I have to use twice as much to get my hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Very gentle to color treated hair when paired with the cream rinse.  </li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried the Biolage color care product.  </li>
            <li> In fact,.this is the only shampoo that I use since started coloring my hair many years ago.</li>
            <li> I gave this shampoo five stars because it is a high-quality shampoo which does exactly what it says - it minimizes fading.  </li>
            <li> Rating it higher than Prell however.</li>
            <li> I first bought this in salons.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many shampoos but I always go back to this!</li>
            <li> Silky soft and frizz free.</li>
            <li> I use it daily and love that it shows up on my doorstep as scheduled with its friend conditioner.</li>
            <li> but I will update on what happens when I straighten it later on:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Matrix for years, and it usually has a great, floral smell and works very well.</li>
            <li> So I bought her favorite shampoo and in the extra large size that saves money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much gentler on my fine highlighted hair but still gets it very clean and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> I am a long time user of Biolage products and I love the shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> Not sure how good it does to protect the color yet but</li>
            <li> I use dry shampoo in between washes, so I am sure this helps hold my color.</li>
            <li> Purchased this large size on Amazon while I still had some Matrix Biolage shampoo from the salon.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner were very drying.  </li>
            <li> Elderly, with very crippling arthritis in both hands</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to struggle so much.</li>
            <li> The combination of these two products gives me very mangeable and beauty hair.</li>
            <li> It has way too much fragrance (it took my breath away and coughing for a min.) and gave my hair greasy feel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle on my hair, yet it really cleans it!&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Its just ok, but I prefer the hydrating formulas over this one, I like to color my hair and also have lots of curls, and I live in a dry climate.</li>
            <li> Most other products cause sores on my scalp,this does not.</li>
            <li> I also use other Biolage by Matrix hair products as well :-)</li>
            <li> This recent bottle that I bought was horrendous - my hair doesn&#x27;t feel clean and the fragrance of the product is not what it normally is.  </li>
            <li> Love this shampoo have thin fine hair.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few shampoos I&#x27;ve used where you can actually smell how good your hair smells after you shower.</li>
            <li> I use to color my hair and that was the main reason I started using it</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it,</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommended for all hair types .</li>
            <li> I love ordering these from Amazon as they are delivered right to my door within a day or two and are priced LESS than they are at my local CVS.</li>
            <li> It rinses clean but doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years with no complaint.  </li>
            <li> Bought the small bottle first to make sure that frequent use would not cause my scalp to be unbearably itchy, not yet anyway.</li>
            <li> I will definitely keep repurchasing this, it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an investment to go to a salon and have the highlights done every few months, so I want to keep my hair looking good as long as I can.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll occasionally use Chi Helmet head hairspray and this shampoo is strong enough to wash it out well</li>
            <li> , it is just that my hair feels super dry after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is the first time ordering shampoo from Amazon and probably my last.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> I previously used a cheap shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell, but this shampoo is average compared to others at the same price.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a clear shampoo</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this product.</li>
            <li> This shampoo always makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> seems to work well &amp; leaves my hair really soft.</li>
            <li> I used this shampoo awhile back really don&#x27;t know why I stopped  </li>
            <li> oh my god my hair feels so soft and supple in the shower</li>
            <li> This Amazon version does not seem as thick or concentrated,  and it may strip my hair more than the salon version.</li>
            <li> I can use a little and get a lot of clean.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to help make your keratin treatment last longer.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a long list of products but those have left my hair with too much residue.</li>
            <li> And it last long cause you don&#x27;t have to use so much of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used multiple products over the years - everything from VO5 on sale for .79 to Profound from my salon at $125/bottle.  </li>
            <li> My hair is not dry, anymore.  </li>
            <li> I guess I am naïve in thinking that if I order Biolage shampoo then that is what I&#x27;ll get - not a very poor imitation in a Biolage bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other supposed color safe shampoos and all they did was leave my hair limp and not very clean.  </li>
            <li> (you can read my previous reviews on it if you&#x27;re interested in dry shampoo).</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling clean, but not filled with a residue - or heavy.  </li>
            <li> It dried my hair out badly which surprised me given the good reviews, back to Ojon.</li>
            <li> either, so this liter bottle will last a long long time!</li>
            <li> I may buy again, but am sure I can get equal quality with a less expensive competitor.</li>
            <li> None of them have worked as well for me and for as long as Biolage Color Care.  </li>
            <li> will always be using this well as long as they are making it.</li>
            <li> Last time I bought the bigger bottle thinking I could pour some into the small bottle to keep in shower.</li>
            <li> it is much heavier and difficult for me to grasp it and open etc to get some shampoo out.</li>
            <li> My aunt actually bought it for herself to maintain her hair color a few weeks ago</li>
            <li> Not sure of this is an old and expired product or whether it s a fake, but it brought the opposite result to my hair than a generic version of the same product purchased from Sally&#x27;s beauty supply.</li>
            <li> Only a small amount is needed to lather your hair.  </li>
            <li> and you only need to use a small amount.</li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;ve decided to stick to the small bottle</li>
            <li> received on time and item is as expected thank you!</li>
            <li> then last week I got my hair colored and died at the salon and because i am half African-American I don&#x27;t really have an oily scalp , only bad product buildup</li>
            <li> I had little luck with other drugstore brands of color-treated shampoos.</li>
            <li> My hair felt like straw after using about half of the bottle.</li>
            <li> so I used less.</li>
            <li> If I didn&#x27;t do this, my hair would be a really dull and ugly shade of light brown.  </li>
            <li> I would keep looking for another product, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I do wash my hair everyday some times twice a day</li>
            <li> plus I use the blow dryer on my hair everyday</li>
            <li> My wife forgot her small bottle of shampoo in a hotel during one of our trips to Louisiana.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so weighed down and very dull.</li>
            <li> The negative for me is just that.</li>
            <li> Did not CLEAN HAIR!!!</li>
            <li> Fake product inside.  </li>
            <li> Wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> This product is a fake!</li>
            <li> I was very unhappy with this product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells toxic and leaves your hair feeling terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to help make your keratin treatment last longer.  It is also awesome for using with color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for over a year now and it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found for fighting the affects of coloring your hair.  It&#x27;s kept my hair from drying out and helps keep the color from fading.  It&#x27;s well worth a try.</li>
            <li> Biolage by Matrix Color Care Shampoo is an excellent product.  Only a small amount is needed to lather your hair.  It also does a great job in volumizing.  I was pleased to find this product sold in a larger container for such a great price on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and continue to order it over and over again.  It is great for color treated hair and makes it shine!!</li>
            <li> This is solid, salon quality shampoo for a great price.  Your color will not fade and your hair won&#x27;t get gunked up with residue.</li>
            <li> biolage color care is the best. it&#x27;s a clear shampoo so it&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down. smells great. light and fresh. i&#x27;ve tried most and this is tops. good value too.</li>
            <li> good price a good product</li>
            <li> This is a great product, definitely keeps the color in your hair for a longer amount of time.  Highly recommend it, well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo I use..and the price is great!! Most other products cause sores on my scalp,this does not.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve found for colored hair.  Color lasts the longest, doesn&#x27;t dry out hair and smells great!  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this product. I dye my hair about every 5-6 weeks and I have been looking for a good color sustaining shampoo that does not leave my hair too moisturized. I have tried a long list of products but those have left my hair with too much residue. This shampoo smells so great and my hair actually feels clean and fresh after use. Now, whether or not this actually sustains color cannot be proven one way or another. After washing hair and with the passing of time, color will dissipate anyway regardless of which shampoo you use. So keeping that in mind, I think this shampoo does a great job and for the price/quantity/quality, you really can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> I was very unhappy with this product. It dried my hair out badly which surprised me given the good reviews, back to Ojon.</li>
            <li> I have used several brands of hair shampoo over the years but Matrix is the best ever for me.  It is economical and leaves your hair exceptionally clean. I only buy this brand for all my hair needs.</li>
            <li> Very gentle to color treated hair when paired with the cream rinse.  I have used this for several years and it keeps my hair very healthy.  Lovely fragrance too!</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner were very drying.  My hair felt like straw after using about half of the bottle. I would keep looking for another product, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have used Biolage Color Care for 5 years and this is not that shampoo. One can see immediately that it is a knock off. The bottle and label do not match that of Biolage products and the shampoo is clearly a different quality. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Biolage by Matrix Color Ca Shampoo -  I love it.  It doesn&#x27;t have all the yucky chemicals in it that I don&#x27;t trust.  And it is safe for color treated hair.  It is a good deal, here.  What isn&#x27;t there to like?  :)</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years with no complaint.  This recent bottle that I bought was horrendous - my hair doesn&#x27;t feel clean and the fragrance of the product is not what it normally is.  Caution when using this specific vendor through Amazon I guess.  I have sent an email to Matrix, but haven&#x27;t heard back from them as of yet.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite shampoo.  I&#x27;ve used multiple products over the years - everything from VO5 on sale for .79 to Profound from my salon at $125/bottle.  None of them have worked as well for me and for as long as Biolage Color Care.  The conditioner is equally as good.  The two together are perfect.  I love ordering these from Amazon as they are delivered right to my door within a day or two and are priced LESS than they are at my local CVS.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey but worth it.  I use it with the Color Care Conditioner and my hair has never been better.  It hydrates, keeps your color, and smells amazing.  I recommend it to anyone who colors their hair.</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted.  works well to maintain color.  good shampoo, nice scent...pleased with product and with the results it brings.</li>
            <li> This shampoo always makes my hair soft and shiny. Does not hurt my color and you only need to use a small amount.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried the Biolage color care product.  I love it, my hair is so smooth and healthy feeling.</li>
            <li> Fake product inside.  Did not CLEAN HAIR!!!</li>
            <li> I had little luck with other drugstore brands of color-treated shampoos. I asked my hairdresser what she recommended, and she likes Biolage. It&#x27;s what she uses in her shop. I bought the huge liter bottle, and she&#x27;s right! It&#x27;s much gentler on my fine highlighted hair but still gets it very clean and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. No need to \\&quot;lather, rinse, repeat\\&quot; either, so this liter bottle will last a long long time! It&#x27;s so nice to finally find a shampoo that works!</li>
            <li> Felt like a diluted version of the product</li>
            <li> I got turned on to this in a salon years ago. I love the smell. Helps my color treatment last longer. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I guess I am naïve in thinking that if I order Biolage shampoo then that is what I&#x27;ll get - not a very poor imitation in a Biolage bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I will never use this vendor again!</li>
            <li> Just love the smell and how my hair look after using it! And it last long cause you don&#x27;t have to use so much of it.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few shampoos I&#x27;ve used where you can actually smell how good your hair smells after you shower. Not sure how good it does to protect the color yet but seems to work well &amp; leaves my hair really soft.</li>
            <li> I learned that shampoo does matter.  I previously used a cheap shampoo.  My thinking was: If you washed it out, why should it matter what shampoo was used?  Cheap shampoo dries out your scalp, thus, your hair.  Matrix shampoo did the trick.  My hair is not dry, anymore.  It also holds the color, well.</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair feels and smells after I wash it with the shampoo and cream rinse. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I used this shampoo awhile back really don&#x27;t know why I stopped  but it is a great shampoo and leaves your hair soft  shinny and smells great</li>
            <li> Bought the small bottle first to make sure that frequent use would not cause my scalp to be unbearably itchy, not yet anyway. Last time I bought the bigger bottle thinking I could pour some into the small bottle to keep in shower. Either there&#x27;s a trick I haven&#x27;t figured out yet but I cannot do it. The negative for me is just that. Elderly, with very crippling arthritis in both hands it is much heavier and difficult for me to grasp it and open etc to get some shampoo out. Next time I&#x27;ve decided to stick to the small bottle so I don&#x27;t have to struggle so much. I do love it and also the smell is quite refreshing but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Great price (better than at the salon) and the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used!  I&#x27;ll never use another one.</li>
            <li> Have used Biolage for years.  Used their Moisturing and Ultra Moisturizing shampoos but find the Color Care really does work best on maintaining the color.</li>
            <li> I love it , it works great !</li>
            <li> This is geat shampoo for hair that is colored. In fact,.this is the only shampoo that I use since started coloring my hair many years ago.I also use Biolage Conditioner. The combination of these two products gives me very mangeable and beauty hair.</li>
            <li> Even freshER scent at economical price, excellent shampoo for color-treated hair, only shampoo I use !!!  HIGHLY recommended for all hair types .</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this shampoo and conditioner. This product is horrible. No match to pantene. It has way too much fragrance (it took my breath away and coughing for a min.) and gave my hair greasy feel. My hair feels so weighed down and very dull. My hair wasnt greasy before using this shampoo. Shiny look is gone. Glad didnt purchase.</li>
            <li> Item as stated and shipped promptly!</li>
            <li> I love everything about this shampoo except the high cost.  Leaves hair feeling clean, but not filled with a residue - or heavy.  Smells lovely!  Seems to work well with color-treated hair.  Wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> Excellent shampoo for color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I gave this shampoo five stars because it is a high-quality shampoo which does exactly what it says - it minimizes fading.  I have used this shampoo for many years and will buy again when needed.</li>
            <li> I am a long time user of Biolage products and I love the shampoo/conditioner. The price was great compared to the stores.</li>
            <li> This shampoo keeps my hair color from fading, leaves my hair clean and soft, and it smells wonderful. This is my color care shampoo of choice!</li>
            <li> only shampoo i will use.  my head does itch all the time. will always be using this well as long as they are making it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is one of my favorites. It never makes my hair feel greasy and it gives me volume. I would definitely recommend this shampoo!</li>
            <li> Purchased this large size on Amazon while I still had some Matrix Biolage shampoo from the salon. This Amazon version does not seem as thick or concentrated,  and it may strip my hair more than the salon version. Rating it higher than Prell however. I  doubt that I will reorder.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for years.  It is mild and smells Great.  I even use it as body wash sometimes!</li>
            <li> I love the smell and this is a  light shampoo. It is easy on the scalp and gentle. I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I first bought this in salons.  It&#x27;s great color care and smells nice but not overly perfumy or strong. I can use a little and get a lot of clean. I will defnitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo my wife uses, and it is about the same price online for a 32 oz. bottle as it is for a 12 oz. bottle locally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many shampoos but I always go back to this! It really preserves my color and smells amazing. I will definitely keep repurchasing this, it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> Its just ok, but I prefer the hydrating formulas over this one, I like to color my hair and also have lots of curls, and I live in a dry climate.</li>
            <li> This is the first time ordering shampoo from Amazon and probably my last. The shampoo works fine but it has been diluted. I have to use twice as much to get my hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li> received on time and item is as expected thank you!</li>
            <li> Great for us old guys that dye our hair...oh, and the misses loves it too...</li>
            <li> This is for my wife, but she goes out of her way to get it, so I think she likes it a ton.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, but this shampoo is average compared to others at the same price. It is gentle as promised so that&#x27;s good too. You don;t need conditioner after using either. I may buy again, but am sure I can get equal quality with a less expensive competitor.</li>
            <li> I guess you could say that I am vain, since I like have blonde highlights in my hair.  If I didn&#x27;t do this, my hair would be a really dull and ugly shade of light brown.  It&#x27;s an investment to go to a salon and have the highlights done every few months, so I want to keep my hair looking good as long as I can.  I&#x27;ve tried other supposed color safe shampoos and all they did was leave my hair limp and not very clean.  This product is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I love this product:&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s gentle on my hair, yet it really cleans it!&lt;br /&gt;* The delicious smell.  I am reminded of being at my hair salon whenever I use this, since this is the product that my salon uses.&lt;br /&gt;* My hair looks so nice and shiny and bright after I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for an effective product  that is also great for color-treated hair, you may just like this.</li>
            <li> So I have been using this for almost 3 months. I use it with It&#x27;s a 10 conditioner. I LOVE IT!!! My hair still holds it&#x27;s color well and I&#x27;ve had so many people ask \\&quot;did you color your hair again?\\&quot; The combination of them work well for me and smells great! Silky soft and frizz free. I only wash my hair TWICE A WEEK. I use dry shampoo in between washes, so I am sure this helps hold my color. I use KMS &amp; Batiste (you can read my previous reviews on it if you&#x27;re interested in dry shampoo). I&#x27;ll occasionally use Chi Helmet head hairspray and this shampoo is strong enough to wash it out well and my hair feels really clean after.&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to comment or ask questions &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shampoo. I use it daily and love that it shows up on my doorstep as scheduled with its friend conditioner. I get to skip the trip to the salon, but get the same product about the same price--but without the nail smell of the salon!</li>
            <li> Very good shampoo for dry hair.</li>
            <li> My aunt actually bought it for herself to maintain her hair color a few weeks ago then last week I got my hair colored and died at the salon and because i am half African-American I don&#x27;t really have an oily scalp , only bad product buildup so I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair every day. so My aunt  left the bottle with me and I decided to try it considering it said color care and  oh my god my hair feels so soft and supple in the shower and it still feels great. The only reason why I give it  Four stars instead of five is because I just used it today to wash my hair but I will update on what happens when I straighten it later on:)</li>
            <li> Not sure of this is an old and expired product or whether it s a fake, but it brought the opposite result to my hair than a generic version of the same product purchased from Sally&#x27;s beauty supply. I do like how it foams, and it smells nice, it is just that my hair feels super dry after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Amazing price for the shampoo I love.It was also here in1 day so thank you for exceptional service.I am very happy.</li>
            <li> I started using this shampoo around 2008 and I have been using it ever since. I use to color my hair and that was the main reason I started using it but I don&#x27;t color my hair anymore and I still use it. I do wash my hair everyday some times twice a day plus I use the blow dryer on my hair everyday so I get heat damage but this shampoo and its conditioner work get on my hair! I also use other Biolage by Matrix hair products as well :-)</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for a long time and I&#x27;m very happy with it. It rinses clean but doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo for colored or high- lighted hair. It seems to be gentle and hold color and shine better, My scalp did itch some with it so I used less. You aren&#x27;t supposed to use but a drop to get a good lather. If your hair doesn&#x27;t lather good with a drop, Rinse and shampoo again. That means your hair has a lot of build up and product on your hair if the shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather good, the 2nd shampoo should remove all of the build up!</li>
            <li> This product is a fake! I&#x27;ve been using Matrix for years, and it usually has a great, floral smell and works very well. This shampoo smells toxic and leaves your hair feeling terrible. Don&#x27;t buy from this seller.</li>
            <li> Good size for the price.</li>
            <li> I treat myself on vacation by going to the salon and spa.  I asked my high-priced Vegas stylist what I can buy when I get home that won&#x27;t break the bank. She recommended Biolage by Matrix. I find that not only does my color last longer but the shampoo does as well!  You don&#x27;t need much to work up a good lather.  I also purchased [[ASIN:B0007CXXDC Biolage by Matrix Color Care Conditioner 33.8 Ounces]] which is also perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying this again - that is when it finally runs out!</li>
            <li> My wife forgot her small bottle of shampoo in a hotel during one of our trips to Louisiana. So I bought her favorite shampoo and in the extra large size that saves money.</li>
            <li> Awesome Shampoo.  I love all of the biolage brand.  Would like to order the hydrating balm next time though.  Need hydration.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo have thin fine hair. Does a great job</li>
            <li> I am not one to spend a lot of money on shampoo&#x27;s but I decided to treat my teenage daughter with some nice shampoo and conditioner.  She keeps dying her hair and the ends seemed frizzy so I thought I would give this a try.  I am addicted; I love the scent and my hair looks great after using this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never felt my hair that happy :D I used a good shampoo before and was also great but this one gave my hair volume and softness.</li>
