            <li>Good price too!</li>
            <li>Very good product and great pricing</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s great for covering the scalp to make hair look thicker.  </li>
            <li>That said, I found it on Amazon at a great price and can now cover those grays while waiting for a trip to the stylist.</li>
            <li>These two work and are great.</li>
            <li>What a great invention.</li>
            <li>Works great, though it washes out so you have to use it everytime after shampooing.  </li>

            <li>Work great and really saves on having to dye hair too often.</li>
            <li>love the product.....</li>
            <li>I have used many root coverage products.</li>
            <li>Perfect to cover grey</li>
            <li>I can easily wait 2-3 weeks longer between touch ups with this spray.</li>
            <li>It works just as described and is so easy to use it</li>
            <li>The product is also easy to spray.</li>
            <li>I have many bald spots as well as quick</li>
            <li>For example, I order the Medium light brown.</li>
            <li>If I am too liberal with the product, I use tissue to blot lightly immediately.</li>
            <li>Great concept to easily mask grey between color-</li>
            <li>A good short term fix.</li>
            <li>I found the product sets quickly and doesn&#x27;t come off (on pillow cases, towels, sheets)</li>
            <li>It does a good job covering up grey hair, but feels sticky and transfers to my hands if I run them though my hair...</li>
            <li>Does a good job covering grey between coloring and doesn&#x27;t wear off.</li>
            <li>Super fast delivery!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and don&#x27;t have to color your hair as frequently.</li>
            <li>I love knowing I can always gently, with no mess, conceal those balding/graying spots.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing, It gives you a little touch-up when you can&#x27;t get to your stylist.  </li>
            <li>Gray and thinning hair has a real friend with this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really use it on the weekends unless I&#x27;m going somewhere fancy.  </li>
            <li>Really need something in between.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery and</li>
            <li>cause my hair grows ridiculously fast.</li>
            <li>Product really does stay on until shampooed out.</li>
            <li>I would say it is definitely more like a dark brown.</li>
            <li>I initially got this product from my stylist and thought it was kind of pricy, especially since I only get a couple of weeks use out of it.</li>
            <li>the next one, blonde, is too light.  </li>
            <li>early does the trick!  </li>
            <li>It is not heavy, spreads well, and I am hooked!</li>
            <li>I spray it on, then work it in for a quick sec with my finger tips.  </li>
            <li>I have bought other brands that &amp;#34;rubbed&amp;#34; off really easy and left residue on your pillow.</li>
            <li>FYI: You must wash out completely before getting hair colored per my stylist, or it can affect the process.</li>
            <li>I would return it, but Amazon WON&#x27;T let you return the product because it&#x27;s flammable --well, they have no trouble shipping to you, but won&#x27;t let you return???</li>
            <li>This is a must for women fighting gray hair coming back too fast after a dye job.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the grey hair even shows as much when I don&#x27;t use the product on the weekend, so it seems like not all of the color washes out.  </li>
            <li>The nozzle allows me to directly spray only the areas I need without any issues.</li>
            <li>Color blends really well with lighter brown to dark brown hair.</li>
            <li>I hold the nozzle a little closer about two inches from my scalp to avoid using so much.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> It covers the grey between colorings, and I have very thin hair on top of my head and it covers the bare spots too!  </li>
            <li> The cans only contain 2 ounces so they don&#x27;t last to long.</li>
            <li> It will wash out when you shampoo, so you&#x27;ll have to use it daily when your grey hairs are showing.  </li>
            <li> I personally preferred it over other product that suppose to do the same job.</li>
            <li> I like Style Edit and Conceal because it covers my grey....</li>
            <li> My messages to the company (local in CA) have remained unanswered</li>
            <li> The only potential negative I find is that it makes my hair a little &amp;#34;gunky&amp;#34; feeling, like there is too much gel or product in that area.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t comment on any further as I wash every other day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a taupe brown, which is a very strange color</li>
            <li> Small can doesn&#x27;t go far.</li>
            <li> My sister and I had tried a myriad of product with no real success until she discovered this</li>
            <li> careful.......</li>
            <li> So it doesn&#x27;t work to cover grays for me since it is too dark.  </li>
            <li> the color is a bit too dark and</li>
            <li> It is dark, dark brown - almost black.</li>
            <li> I have sandy brown color hair, so I bought the \\&quot;Medium/Light\\&quot; color per recommendations from other reviewers to buy a little darker.  </li>
            <li> With this product, I can go  two months or longer without a visit to my hair stylist -typically</li>
            <li> I have no issues as some of the reviews mentioned with a mess.</li>
            <li> I just spray a little where I part my hair to cover roots between getting coloring.</li>
            <li> Sticky and messy.</li>
            <li> No overspray or excessive product comes out.</li>
            <li> well at least hidden!</li>
            <li> and it lasts through at least two days without having to retouch.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not a good way to run a business.</li>
            <li> VERY hard to match your hair color with these types of items.  </li>
            <li> is ridiculous!</li>
            <li> so I am a little disappointed....</li>
            <li> the product is expensive for what you get.</li>
            <li> Sadly, Style Edit doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I&#x27;m hooked!!!!!</li>
            <li> Awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this stuff!  early does the trick!  I spray it one and am able to go 6 weeks without having my roots done.  Used to be that I had to do them every 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Works good.  I ordered more !</li>
            <li> Gray is gone...well at least hidden!</li>
            <li> I love this!  It covers up the gray as well as any bald spots!!! Just spray it on!</li>
            <li> Very good product and great pricing</li>
            <li> Sticky and messy. Like hairspray with a color so it literally goes everywhere. It does a good job covering up grey hair, but feels sticky and transfers to my hands if I run them though my hair...</li>
            <li> This spray is wonderful! I had been using the stick cover-up for years until I discovered this. It matches perfectly, goes on so easily and will save me SO much money on salon visits. I can easily wait 2-3 weeks longer between touch ups with this spray. It&#x27;s a life saver!</li>
            <li> This stuff is WONDERFUL, $20 a can at salon. Great price &amp; fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The best hair concealer I&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  It covers the grey between colorings, and I have very thin hair on top of my head and it covers the bare spots too!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Works well to cover gray, but you must spray quite a while to get the coverage. Small can doesn&#x27;t go far.</li>
            <li> God send. I now go extra week for my permanent color. It can be a bit tacky if you overspray an area. FYI: You must wash out completely before getting hair colored per my stylist, or it can affect the process.</li>
            <li> VERY hard to match your hair color with these types of items.  So it doesn&#x27;t work to cover grays for me since it is too dark.  However, it&#x27;s great for covering the scalp to make hair look thicker.  Does make it itchy though.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so helpful to help me extend the length of time between colorings.  Gray and thinning hair has a real friend with this stuff.  In some ways a bit pricey but well worth it for peace of mind and feeling good about how I look.  I love knowing I can always gently, with no mess, conceal those balding/graying spots.  My sister and I had tried a myriad of product with no real success until she discovered this and we have both used this exclusively since.</li>
            <li> Great product! Great price! Super fast delivery! Thank you!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is awesome stuff.  I have sandy brown color hair, so I bought the \\&quot;Medium/Light\\&quot; color per recommendations from other reviewers to buy a little darker.  This color blends perfect with my hair.  I hold the nozzle a little closer about two inches from my scalp to avoid using so much.  I spray it on, then work it in for a quick sec with my finger tips.  Comes out perfect.  It&#x27;s not chalky or sticky feeling and does not rub out onto my pillow cases.  It will wash out when you shampoo, so you&#x27;ll have to use it daily when your grey hairs are showing.  Wonderful stuff - I&#x27;ve been able to push my hair color appt out six weeks and my hair is still looking good with this stuff. I used one 2oz bottle in 4 weeks when applying it each weekday for work.  Don&#x27;t really use it on the weekends unless I&#x27;m going somewhere fancy.  I don&#x27;t think the grey hair even shows as much when I don&#x27;t use the product on the weekend, so it seems like not all of the color washes out.  Great stuff!  I just ordered the 3-pack thru Amazon for $33 - great deal!</li>
            <li> I love it. Easy to use and don&#x27;t have to color your hair as frequently. The cans only contain 2 ounces so they don&#x27;t last to long. the product is expensive for what you get.</li>
            <li> I initially got this product from my stylist and thought it was kind of pricy, especially since I only get a couple of weeks use out of it. That said, I found it on Amazon at a great price and can now cover those grays while waiting for a trip to the stylist. The only potential negative I find is that it makes my hair a little &amp;#34;gunky&amp;#34; feeling, like there is too much gel or product in that area. However, it is not enough of a drawback to make me stop using it- and it lasts through at least two days without having to retouch. Can&#x27;t comment on any further as I wash every other day.</li>
            <li> Perfect to cover grey</li>
            <li> Save your money! This stuff doesn&#x27;t cover anything. It&#x27;s a taupe brown, which is a very strange color and it just doesn&#x27;t work! I would return it, but Amazon WON&#x27;T let you return the product because it&#x27;s flammable --well, they have no trouble shipping to you, but won&#x27;t let you return??? That&#x27;s not a good way to run a business. There are two products that are MUCH better: Eufora has a great touch-up color hair spray and so does Bumble and Bumble. These two work and are great. Sadly, Style Edit doesn&#x27;t work at all. Now I&#x27;m stuck with this color and the blonde...arg!</li>
            <li> What a great invention.</li>
            <li> wife likes it so I like it</li>
            <li> Great product that does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I like Style Edit and Conceal because it covers my grey....</li>
            <li> Great concept to easily mask grey between color- the color is a bit too dark and the next one, blonde, is too light.  Really need something in between.  My messages to the company (local in CA) have remained unanswered so I am a little disappointed....</li>
            <li> If it weren&#x27;t for this product, I would be wearing a wig.  I love this stuff.  I have many bald spots as well as quick growing roots.&lt;br /&gt;This covers it perfectly and doesn&#x27;t come off on your pillow.  You can even rinse your hair and  if you don&#x27;t use shampoo, the color stays in yet you have freshened up your hair.</li>
            <li> I personally preferred it over other product that suppose to do the same job. Does a good job covering grey between coloring and doesn&#x27;t wear off.</li>
            <li> Works great, though it washes out so you have to use it everytime after shampooing.  A good short term fix.</li>
            <li> I love the coverage and EASE of use!!</li>
            <li> Perfect for a quick fix</li>
            <li> Very similar to the Rita Hazan product.  Good price too!</li>
            <li> This is a must for women fighting gray hair coming back too fast after a dye job.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Very good product.  Wish it were cheaper</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and the product is correct and amazing I love it 😃</li>
            <li> This spray is a great way to cover gray roots in between coloring.  It is dark, dark brown - almost black.</li>
            <li> Good seller. Good stuff does not run or rub off onto pillow during sleep.Saves root dying in between total scalp dying for color.</li>
            <li> Style Edit does what I need for it to do for me. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love this &amp;#34;style edit&#x27; brand. If you want to hide your roots between colorings it is perfect. I have bought other brands that &amp;#34;rubbed&amp;#34; off really easy and left residue on your pillow. This stuff stays put between washings. Just a note, color is a darker than you might expect. For example, I order the Medium light brown. I would say it is definitely more like a dark brown. But, I like it anyway. Color works well for me. Color blends really well with lighter brown to dark brown hair. I just spray a little where I part my hair to cover roots between getting coloring. Work great and really saves on having to dye hair too often.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING! It works just as described and is so easy to use it is ridiculous! The product is also easy to spray. The nozzle allows me to directly spray only the areas I need without any issues. No overspray or excessive product comes out. I have no issues as some of the reviews mentioned with a mess. If I am too liberal with the product, I use tissue to blot lightly immediately. I am using this product sparingly to touch up my grays while on a work detail across the country. With this product, I can go  two months or longer without a visit to my hair stylist -typically every 4 weeks for a root touch up cause my hair grows ridiculously fast. I found the product sets quickly and doesn&#x27;t come off (on pillow cases, towels, sheets) once set. I have even worked out with this stuff in my hair with no issues there either. Follow the instructions just as I did and you should have a similar experience! Product really does stay on until shampooed out. It is not heavy, spreads well, and I am hooked! I wish I had looked into this sooner! Seriously, I&#x27;m hooked!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, It gives you a little touch-up when you can&#x27;t get to your stylist.  Just spray and go!</li>
            <li> This is without any doubt, the best gray hair concealer ever!</li>
            <li> love the product..... only caution is..... careful.......sometimes drips although it is washable!</li>
            <li> great product, I use it all the time between coloring.  The actual color is darker</li>
            <li> Awful. It makes your hair sticky and comes off when you touch your hair. Would like to return it!</li>
            <li> Excellent Product! I have used many root coverage products. For me...Style Edit is the best coverage.</li>
            <li> Covers perfectly, does&#x27;t rub off.</li>
            <li> The best hair color concealer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! Covers gray well</li>
            <li> Best stuff out there for covering gray roots!</li>
