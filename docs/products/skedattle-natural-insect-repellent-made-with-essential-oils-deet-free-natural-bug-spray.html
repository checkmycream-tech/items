            <li>I used this for the first time this weekend while camping and it worked great!</li>
            <li>She is OK with this!  </li>
            <li>Works real good, smells mighty great &amp; it was delivered very fast.</li>
            <li>The smell is great and it goes on in a fine mist</li>
            <li>Works amazingly well and smells nice.  </li>
            <li>Nice scent as well.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, like vanilla.</li>
            <li>Effective against mosquitos but not houseflies and bees.  </li>
            <li>The clerk commented that something smelled really nice.</li>
            <li>Thanks for an excellent product.</li>
            <li>Pretty good stuff!</li>
            <li>This stuff smells pretty good as well!</li>
            <li>The top is defective and therefore doesn&#x27;t allow the spray to come out effectively.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work at all, smells really strong!</li>
            <li>Great spraying mist and nice large bottle.</li>
            <li>It works great for me, this is the first mosquito repellant I&#x27;ve found that works for me.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I like that it is environmentally safe.</li>
            <li>purchased two bottles of this product, because I was impressed initially</li>
            <li>However, I think that would be an issue with most any product.  </li>
            <li>(I would also wholeheartedly recommend the sunscreen product, Coral Safe.)</li>
            <li>this works very well and smells great.</li>
            <li>He said that a fan blowing on him works much better than that Skedattle stuff.</li>
            <li>What more could you ask?</li>
            <li>It smells like citronella but thats better than most bugsprays smell.</li>
            <li>We used it for mosquitoes, ticks and love bugs.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the greasy feeling that most bug repellants have.</li>
            <li>My wife loves this product and we use it on our Grand kids without worry.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more of this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so this seems like a safe compromise</li>
            <li>I do love that it&#x27;s chemical free and made from herbs that have a nice scent.</li>
            <li>I am the type of bug magnet that people love to take with, because when I am around nobody else gets bitten.</li>
            <li>This bug spray fit the bill and worked well!</li>
            <li>We sat out around a campfire most of the night, singing and listening to music and my wife was not bitten once.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff and to know that its ECO friendly is even better.</li>
            <li>So far, happy with it.</li>
            <li>Worked well, but some of my family did not like the strong smell.  </li>
            <li>This can be sprayed on the dog&#x27;s coat - it sprays out in a really fine mist.  </li>
            <li>It was nice to know that it&#x27;s an environmentally safe product with no harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>Great repellent, and it smells really good too - great for the kids in our country home!</li>
            <li>It smells great, and the insects totally left me alone!  </li>
            <li>Once in a while, a biting fly takes a swoop or two at me, but he won&#x27;t get close enough to me to bite!</li>
            <li>Does a great job and its allowed in Mexican eco parks Xcaret and Xel-Ha</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>Cancun is such a lovely, warm, sunny, Caribbean destination in August.  </li>
            <li>Love that it is non-toxic, but it has to be constantly reapplied every 30 minutes to an hour in order to be effective.</li>
            <li>But most important, it works very well to keep mosquitos away.</li>
            <li>Everyone else was covered with bright red bites on their legs and feet.</li>
            <li>So I read about this product on a Google search to find &amp;#34;natural ways to rid misquotes&amp;#34; and so far it&#x27;s been amazing.</li>
            <li>My legs are full of welts from the bites.  </li>
            <li>Smells good and actually works!</li>
            <li>This stuff actually works, and it smells really good.</li>
            <li>Riding the train that was full of mosquitos</li>
            <li>/&gt;Oh, a quick warning, it smells like Citronella and some people can&#x27;t stand the strong smell of citronella so just be aware of folks allergic to citronella products.</li>
            <li>The smell is ok...until you go into an enclosed space, where it quickly becomes cloying and it lingers for hours.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>For a quick outing, in areas without a ton of insects, or for indoor use</li>
            <li>Most times I use the normal brands (Off)</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like the smell, but others in my group thought it smelled fine</li>
            <li>More frequent applications might be needed in this case, which is not an issue for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I think it is worth giving it a try.</li>
            <li>Really love the product, and I&#x27;m relieved I can put something on my 8 wk old babies skin that won&#x27;t harm her.</li>
            <li>I love knowing this is completely natural, with no worrisome or foul-smelling chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant about buying this, but worked pretty well, but does seem to wear off quickly.</li>
            <li>I thought we had found the right product.  </li>
            <li>I sprayed continously and watched them land right on my skin and bite me.</li>
            <li>Actually smells nice and works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Vacationed in Wisconsin - the ticks were awful - this spray - protected my family from mosquito bites and ticks great - not one bite - smells good too!!  </li>
            <li>so far it seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I was trying to be respectful of the environment in Mexico when visiting the archaeological sites.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great, but for outdoor tropical areas, it was unfortunately not effective.</li>
            <li>I really like this product!  </li>
            <li>Insects really don&#x27;t like this stuff!</li>
            <li>One funny note...</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t smell funny.</li>
            <li>I think it works pretty well too.  </li>
            <li>This repellant smells amazing, and without anything harsh and chemically.  </li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>However, the bees were very attracted to me.  </li>
            <li>I found that the product works very well, unless we are working a lot in the humidity and sweating it off.  </li>
            <li>Much nicer than DEET.</li>
            <li>Not one bug bite the whole week.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell</li>
            <li>The delivery was fast and the product arrived as promised.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It even worked better than Skin so Soft which I had used for several years.</li>
            <li>The product smelled much better than other products, and my friend swears it worked for her</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure  that it&#x27;s truly effective.</li>
            <li>I did not get bit, though I haven&#x27;t tested it on the full gamut of tiny forest &#x27;wildlife&#x27; yet.  </li>
            <li>Purchased more - for next future trips.</li>
            <li>my daughter is very allergic to mosquito bites and this has kept them away completely.</li>
            <li>and I live in maine</li>
            <li>My husband is normally very sensitive about any perfumes or smells</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>The scent is not overpowering as some natural repellants can be!</li>
            <li>Do NOT waste your money!</li>
            <li>I sprayed it on my 5 year old and myself and went to a backyard birthday party without issues.  </li>
            <li>and I like that it is all natural.  </li>
            <li>I bought this stuff for my brother who is an artist and paints out of doors frequently.</li>
            <li>I searched for something that would be natural - no harsh chemicals - that could be used by us and that we could put on our pets.  </li>
            <li>If your looking for a natural spray for yard work or any outdoor activity this is it.</li>
            <li>so my 2 yr old doesn&#x27;t flinch when I put it on her.  </li>
            <li>If there is a bug within 100 yards, it will be near me.</li>
            <li>I smell of natural oils</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve gotten not a few comments on that.</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s all natural with no chemicals.  </li>
            <li>The entire bottle is very sticky even though it was wrapped in a zip lock bag.</li>
            <li>far as the scent goes....</li>
            <li>will edit my review if I find it does not repel ticks, but for the moment, I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised by this product.</li>
            <li>Not being bit is the aim, however, and thus far its working like a charm...</li>
            <li>The first time I put it on, my wife came out and joined me a few hours later and kept saying &amp;#34;I smell hot chocolate!&amp;#34</li>
            <li>It is a bit strong, but that fades relatively quickly, and it&#x27;s certainly a better smell than a traditional bug repellent spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After being bitten on the forehead a few weeks ago which required steroids to get the swelling and inflammation under I started searching for a chemical free alternatives to traditional DEET bug sprays.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried everything and found out about deet, a harmful chemical that&#x27;s common in most big sprays, and decided I was not going to use anything with that ingredient on me or my baby.</li>
            <li>, it dried quickly and the bugs stayed away.</li>
            <li>I was curious but skeptical about this product, which sounded a little too good to be true.</li>
            <li>This was my second test run, with zero bites thus far.</li>
            <li>but I live on open acreage with deep grass and trees, where dense clouds of mosquitoes can swarm visibly even at midday and where ticks thrive.</li>
            <li>I only wish that healthy alternatives weren&#x27;t more expensive than their unhealthy counterparts.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t tried it in deep tick territory yet, but I can say that I walked last night through twilight and beyond and got not a single mosquito bite.</li>

            <li> It smells great, and the insects totally left me alone!  </li>
            <li> Once in a while, a biting fly takes a swoop or two at me, but he won&#x27;t get close enough to me to bite!</li>
            <li> Does a great job and its allowed in Mexican eco parks Xcaret and Xel-Ha</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> Cancun is such a lovely, warm, sunny, Caribbean destination in August.  </li>
            <li> Love that it is non-toxic, but it has to be constantly reapplied every 30 minutes to an hour in order to be effective.</li>
            <li> But most important, it works very well to keep mosquitos away.</li>
            <li> Everyone else was covered with bright red bites on their legs and feet.</li>
            <li> So I read about this product on a Google search to find &amp;#34;natural ways to rid misquotes&amp;#34; and so far it&#x27;s been amazing.</li>
            <li> My legs are full of welts from the bites.  </li>
            <li> Smells good and actually works!</li>
            <li> This stuff actually works, and it smells really good.</li>
            <li> Riding the train that was full of mosquitos</li>
            <li> /&gt;Oh, a quick warning, it smells like Citronella and some people can&#x27;t stand the strong smell of citronella so just be aware of folks allergic to citronella products.</li>
            <li> The smell is ok...until you go into an enclosed space, where it quickly becomes cloying and it lingers for hours.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> For a quick outing, in areas without a ton of insects, or for indoor use</li>
            <li> Most times I use the normal brands (Off)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like the smell, but others in my group thought it smelled fine</li>
            <li> More frequent applications might be needed in this case, which is not an issue for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I think it is worth giving it a try.</li>
            <li> Really love the product, and I&#x27;m relieved I can put something on my 8 wk old babies skin that won&#x27;t harm her.</li>
            <li> I love knowing this is completely natural, with no worrisome or foul-smelling chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant about buying this, but worked pretty well, but does seem to wear off quickly.</li>
            <li> I thought we had found the right product.  </li>
            <li> I sprayed continously and watched them land right on my skin and bite me.</li>
            <li> Actually smells nice and works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Vacationed in Wisconsin - the ticks were awful - this spray - protected my family from mosquito bites and ticks great - not one bite - smells good too!!  </li>
            <li> so far it seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I was trying to be respectful of the environment in Mexico when visiting the archaeological sites.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great, but for outdoor tropical areas, it was unfortunately not effective.</li>
            <li> I really like this product!  </li>
            <li> Insects really don&#x27;t like this stuff!</li>
            <li> One funny note...</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t smell funny.</li>
            <li> I think it works pretty well too.  </li>
            <li> This repellant smells amazing, and without anything harsh and chemically.  </li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> However, the bees were very attracted to me.  </li>
            <li> I found that the product works very well, unless we are working a lot in the humidity and sweating it off.  </li>
            <li> Much nicer than DEET.</li>
            <li> Not one bug bite the whole week.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell</li>
            <li> The delivery was fast and the product arrived as promised.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It even worked better than Skin so Soft which I had used for several years.</li>
            <li> The product smelled much better than other products, and my friend swears it worked for her</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure  that it&#x27;s truly effective.</li>
            <li> I did not get bit, though I haven&#x27;t tested it on the full gamut of tiny forest &#x27;wildlife&#x27; yet.  </li>
            <li> Purchased more - for next future trips.</li>
            <li> my daughter is very allergic to mosquito bites and this has kept them away completely.</li>
            <li> and I live in maine</li>
            <li> My husband is normally very sensitive about any perfumes or smells</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> The scent is not overpowering as some natural repellants can be!</li>
            <li> Do NOT waste your money!</li>
            <li> I sprayed it on my 5 year old and myself and went to a backyard birthday party without issues.  </li>
            <li> and I like that it is all natural.  </li>
            <li> I bought this stuff for my brother who is an artist and paints out of doors frequently.</li>
            <li> I searched for something that would be natural - no harsh chemicals - that could be used by us and that we could put on our pets.  </li>
            <li> If your looking for a natural spray for yard work or any outdoor activity this is it.</li>
            <li> so my 2 yr old doesn&#x27;t flinch when I put it on her.  </li>
            <li> If there is a bug within 100 yards, it will be near me.</li>
            <li> I smell of natural oils</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve gotten not a few comments on that.</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s all natural with no chemicals.  </li>
            <li> The entire bottle is very sticky even though it was wrapped in a zip lock bag.</li>
            <li> far as the scent goes....</li>
            <li> will edit my review if I find it does not repel ticks, but for the moment, I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised by this product.</li>
            <li> Not being bit is the aim, however, and thus far its working like a charm...</li>
            <li> The first time I put it on, my wife came out and joined me a few hours later and kept saying &amp;#34;I smell hot chocolate!&amp;#34</li>
            <li> It is a bit strong, but that fades relatively quickly, and it&#x27;s certainly a better smell than a traditional bug repellent spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After being bitten on the forehead a few weeks ago which required steroids to get the swelling and inflammation under I started searching for a chemical free alternatives to traditional DEET bug sprays.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried everything and found out about deet, a harmful chemical that&#x27;s common in most big sprays, and decided I was not going to use anything with that ingredient on me or my baby.</li>
            <li> , it dried quickly and the bugs stayed away.</li>
            <li> I was curious but skeptical about this product, which sounded a little too good to be true.</li>
            <li> This was my second test run, with zero bites thus far.</li>
            <li> but I live on open acreage with deep grass and trees, where dense clouds of mosquitoes can swarm visibly even at midday and where ticks thrive.</li>
            <li> I only wish that healthy alternatives weren&#x27;t more expensive than their unhealthy counterparts.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t tried it in deep tick territory yet, but I can say that I walked last night through twilight and beyond and got not a single mosquito bite.</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased CoralSafe sunscreen directly from the makers (online) and received a sample of Skedattle.  </li>
            <li> It has very limited effectiveness and only then when you coat yourself in the stuff.  </li>
            <li> Used this stuff at a monkey preserve in Honduras...</li>
            <li> but this company want to charge me almost $7 to ship it back and that I would only receive little over $3 refund.</li>
            <li> I was outside for just a little bit in the deep woods.  </li>
            <li> and I have lots of mosquitoes, ticks, biting flies, and all sorts of other &amp;#34;critters&amp;#34; back there.</li>
            <li> My wife is constantly bothered by mosquitos and other biting insects.  </li>
            <li> I put it on my very long, curly hair and on my clothes (doesn&#x27;t stain), spray my shoes (haven&#x27;t tried leather)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get a single bite.</li>
            <li> I usually get eaten alive by mosquitos.</li>
            <li> Ive only had a chance to use this product once, I was working in my garden after the sun went down</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but it actually works.</li>
            <li> I like knowing that I can put this on them, without the same types of fears as with heavy</li>
            <li> We tried to think green especially considering we had plans for places that required biodegradable sprays and sun blocks.  </li>
            <li> Not very happy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So, my nephew brought Skedattle to the lake where we spent a week and sprayed it around.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not thrilled about putting DEET and other repellents on my skin -- I&#x27;m not super-clean about artificial chemicals, but why expose more than necessary?</li>
            <li> This stuff is great and despite other reviews, it doesn&#x27;t smell terrible.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very pleased not to use the horrible chemicals anymore.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want her to play with other kids and get deet on them.  </li>
            <li> Of course it has a scent, it&#x27;s composed of citronella, lemongrass, and peppermint oils, among other things.</li>
            <li> When I put other repellents on my dog runs and hides from me.  </li>
            <li> (I am still sporting the bites from previous outings without repellent.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Whether the scent is too strong or too distasteful is going to be a personal call, but I don&#x27;t find it unpleasant.</li>
            <li> It smells a little funky.  </li>
            <li> The Fragrance is way too heavy and you won&#x27;t put it on your skin.</li>
            <li> What a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I like that this product is environmentally friendly, but if it doesn&#x27;t repel mosquitos, it&#x27;s worthless.</li>
            <li> Either way, better than that disgusting smell of DEET!</li>
            <li> My son does not love the smell</li>
            <li> We used this in the jungle in middle of the Yucatan peninsula and it seemed to work well, although it was during the middle of the day (not during sunset when bugs are at there worst.)  </li>
            <li> Skedattle is surprisingly NOT sticky or oily, even though it&#x27;s made up of oils.</li>
            <li> I wanted a natural repellent for Texas sized mosquitoes and this one worked.</li>
            <li> They stay a distance, confused, wondering what is going on.&lt;br /&gt;Skedattle smells heavenly too.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the Skedattle didn&#x27;t quite work out for the wife and I.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately didn&#x27;t seem to deter the mosquitoes.  </li>
            <li> Too bad</li>
            <li> V disappointed with this.  </li>
            <li> but you don&#x27;t get the burning feeling a deet base bug spray gives you.</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d give this product a try because I had an allergic reaction to an insect repellent containing 40% DEET, so I wanted to go with something &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Horrible peoduct!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This item was described that there is no fragrance to it and it is a lie. The Fragrance is way too heavy and you won&#x27;t put it on your skin. I tried to return the item but this company want to charge me almost $7 to ship it back and that I would only receive little over $3 refund. What a joke are these lairs are. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM</li>
            <li> Love it. Works great and smell good too. thanks</li>
            <li> Love this product, I used it on my myself, children and rabbits and no mosquito bites! I personally love the smell and will buy this again! Great spraying mist and nice large bottle.</li>
            <li> Worked well, but some of my family did not like the strong smell.  I like that it is environmentally safe.</li>
            <li> I thought we had found the right product.  I was outside for just a little bit in the deep woods.  I had a mosquito land on me and I wanted to see what happened so I did nothing but watch.  The mosquito left without biting me.  Wow!  However, the bees were very attracted to me.  I want the best of both worlds!  I wish the bees didn&#x27;t like this spray.</li>
            <li> Ive only had a chance to use this product once, I was working in my garden after the sun went down, thats when the mesquiteos come out. They were all around me, but didn&#x27;t land or bite. Pretty good stuff!</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  I sprayed it on my 5 year old and myself and went to a backyard birthday party without issues.  Later I did use it and got 1 misquito bite, but maybe I didn&#x27;t spray enough.  I like giving it to my kid bc I can&#x27;t always give her a bath afterwards and I don&#x27;t want her to play with other kids and get deet on them.  So far, happy with it.</li>
            <li> We were on a trip that required biodegradable insect repellant, and applied this as directed but both of us had a dozen mosquito bites after the activity.  I like that this product is environmentally friendly, but if it doesn&#x27;t repel mosquitos, it&#x27;s worthless.</li>
            <li> We love this product! I wanted a natural repellent for Texas sized mosquitoes and this one worked. We can play outside without fear. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased CoralSafe sunscreen directly from the makers (online) and received a sample of Skedattle.  My husband and I used the individual packets while on a tour in Mexico.  We were amazed at how well it worked, as we could see bugs hovering above our skin, before flying away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased two bottles of this product, because I was impressed initially and I like that it is all natural.  I have children and I like knowing that I can put this on them, without the same types of fears as with heavy chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have already tested this out around our home, where the mosquitoes have just started to come out.  All of my family has commented on the pleasant smell.  I found that the product works very well, unless we are working a lot in the humidity and sweating it off.  However, I think that would be an issue with most any product.  More frequent applications might be needed in this case, which is not an issue for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product and would purchase again.  (I would also wholeheartedly recommend the sunscreen product, Coral Safe.)</li>
            <li> awesome an d  daughter loves  the smell &#x3D;&#x3D;wass a gift to her</li>
            <li> Love it! Works just as good as any bug spray without the deet and leaving you feeling sticky! Plus it smells good too!</li>
            <li> Used this stuff at a monkey preserve in Honduras... Everyone else was covered with bright red bites on their legs and feet. I didn&#x27;t get a single bite. This stuff is great and despite other reviews, it doesn&#x27;t smell terrible. After a minute the smell basically goes away.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best!  Skedattle is a staple in our camping/vacation gear - we even use it on our dog.  It smells great and is very easy to apply.  We have recommended this product to everyone we know - everyone loves it!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about buying this, but worked pretty well, but does seem to wear off quickly. The scent is not overpowering as some natural repellants can be!</li>
            <li> Good product, nice smell seems to work well</li>
            <li> Great repellent, and it smells really good too - great for the kids in our country home!</li>
            <li> I am a mosquito magnet.  This product has worked fairly well for me</li>
            <li> Needed organic bug spray for trip to Mexico, worked great and has a nice smell</li>
            <li> Hesitated going outdoors this time of year, as using DEET  on myself and children seemed the only way to avoid mosquitos. Used Skedaddle today and it worked great. Smelled wonderful too!  May try it on my cat too, as he has adverse reactions to mosquito bites. So far, so good. Would recommend it!</li>
            <li> It leaves a bit of an oily film on skin that goes away after about an hour but lasts about 18 hours with one use</li>
            <li> this works very well and smells great. my daughter is very allergic to mosquito bites and this has kept them away completely. i am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> It does NOT work. I bought this stuff for my brother who is an artist and paints out of doors frequently. He tried it again and again, it simply does NOT KEEP THE MOSQUITOS FROM BITING HIM ! !  He said that a fan blowing on him works much better than that Skedattle stuff.</li>
            <li> I like it because you can use it on kids and pets. You have to apply the repellant often. The top is defective and therefore doesn&#x27;t allow the spray to come out effectively.</li>
            <li> V disappointed with this.  It has very limited effectiveness and only then when you coat yourself in the stuff.  The smell is ok...until you go into an enclosed space, where it quickly becomes cloying and it lingers for hours.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t work for my wife or son either, so not just something with my personal chemistry.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this was meant to spray on humans.  I sprayed it on the placemat under my cats food dish and the ants won&#x27;t touch it! This is ideal.</li>
            <li> It works fairly well. It does need to be applied about every 1-2 hours but you don&#x27;t get the burning feeling a deet base bug spray gives you.</li>
            <li> Works real good, smells mighty great &amp; it was delivered very fast. What more could you ask?</li>
            <li> Works great without the worry of deet being on your skin. It smells like citronella but thats better than most bugsprays smell. I was in the Florida Keys and didnt get bit once while wearing this. I usually get eaten alive by mosquitos.</li>
            <li> I searched for something that would be natural - no harsh chemicals - that could be used by us and that we could put on our pets.  This can be sprayed on the dog&#x27;s coat - it sprays out in a really fine mist.  It can also be sprayed on your clothes or hair - don&#x27;t hold it close.  You never have to put it on your skin.  It works.  We used it for mosquitoes, ticks and love bugs.  I will definitely order it again. I like the scent/smell of it and so does everyone else.  We also sprayed it around our doorways outside and inside and it works.</li>
            <li> Cancun is such a lovely, warm, sunny, Caribbean destination in August.  Everyone, including the mosquitos enjoys visiting.  Unfortunately, the Skedattle didn&#x27;t quite work out for the wife and I.  We tried to think green especially considering we had plans for places that required biodegradable sprays and sun blocks.  Let&#x27;s just say that around the resort we ended up running out of our spray with deet because we were tortured otherwise while using this product.  Too bad really when you think of the price tag and perceived &#x27;green&#x27; potential.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. My husband is normally very sensitive about any perfumes or smells and he loves this stuff. Works great!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately didn&#x27;t seem to deter the mosquitoes.  The product smelled much better than other products, and my friend swears it worked for her but I was still swarmed and bitten repeatedly.  Such a bummer!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the greasy feeling that most bug repellants have. I didn&#x27;t get bit once while going through the jungles in Cancun.</li>
            <li> I used it and I stll got mosquito bites.  This product didn&#x27;t work for me.  I was trying to be respectful of the environment in Mexico when visiting the archaeological sites.  The mosquitoes had a feast on me.  My legs are full of welts from the bites.  I ended up throwing it out.  What a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Love that it is non-toxic, but it has to be constantly reapplied every 30 minutes to an hour in order to be effective. For a quick outing, in areas without a ton of insects, or for indoor use it&#x27;s great, but for outdoor tropical areas, it was unfortunately not effective.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product and we use it on our Grand kids without worry. Nice scent as well.</li>
            <li> Worked good for some people but not for others.  Respraying seemed to be necessary.  My grandson loved the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Love! Smells good and actually works! Just have to keep reapplying but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> After being bitten on the forehead a few weeks ago which required steroids to get the swelling and inflammation under I started searching for a chemical free alternatives to traditional DEET bug sprays. I found this and I could not be happier! Not only does it smell yummy but it was incredibly affective at keeping the bugs away. It even worked better than Skin so Soft which I had used for several years. If your looking for a natural spray for yard work or any outdoor activity this is it. I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing this again in the future.</li>
            <li> Skedattle is surprisingly NOT sticky or oily, even though it&#x27;s made up of oils. It smells nice, like vanilla. But most important, it works very well to keep mosquitos away. I&#x27;ve learned to apply &amp;#34;heavily&amp;#34; as directions say: not just spray once &amp; rub on but spray into my hand 2-3 times to cover exposed areas. Seems to last about 2 hrs before mosquitos start coming at me.</li>
            <li> Effective against mosquitos but not houseflies and bees.  Anyway, I no longer get mosquito bites during my sleep!  Before this, I would get several bites a night - THANK GOD for Skedattle!  I will be ordering more of this.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, a quick warning, it smells like Citronella and some people can&#x27;t stand the strong smell of citronella so just be aware of folks allergic to citronella products.</li>
            <li> Does the trick without the chemicals ... Still get bit once and awhile but I do with big sprays with deet so this seems like a safe compromise</li>
            <li> It smells a little funky.  I didn&#x27;t really like the smell, but others in my group thought it smelled fine, so I guess it&#x27;s a personal preference.  We used this in the jungle in middle of the Yucatan peninsula and it seemed to work well, although it was during the middle of the day (not during sunset when bugs are at there worst.)  I think it is worth giving it a try.</li>
            <li> The smell is great and it goes on in a fine mist so my 2 yr old doesn&#x27;t flinch when I put it on her.  The mosquitos still bit me though.</li>
            <li> Really love the product, and I&#x27;m relieved I can put something on my 8 wk old babies skin that won&#x27;t harm her. We just moved to Florida and I&#x27;ve tried everything and found out about deet, a harmful chemical that&#x27;s common in most big sprays, and decided I was not going to use anything with that ingredient on me or my baby. So I read about this product on a Google search to find &amp;#34;natural ways to rid misquotes&amp;#34; and so far it&#x27;s been amazing.</li>
            <li> Great scent but I was still getting biten so I&#x27;m not sure  that it&#x27;s truly effective. I do love that it&#x27;s chemical free and made from herbs that have a nice scent.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually works, and it smells really good. Much nicer than DEET. I was skeptical at first, but it actually works.</li>
            <li> I really like this product!  It smells great, and the insects totally left me alone!  I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Works great and smells good&lt;br /&gt; Went to the store and forget I had it on. The clerk commented that something smelled really nice. I said it&#x27;s my bug spray!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! I do a lot of work on my property in the woods. There is a creek and I have lots of mosquitoes, ticks, biting flies, and all sorts of other &amp;#34;critters&amp;#34; back there. I figured I&#x27;d give this product a try because I had an allergic reaction to an insect repellent containing 40% DEET, so I wanted to go with something &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;. I spray this stuff on my arms, legs, and neck... and NOTHING bothers me! Once in a while, a biting fly takes a swoop or two at me, but he won&#x27;t get close enough to me to bite! Insects really don&#x27;t like this stuff! This stuff is not sticky at all like DEET and it lasts for about 4 to 6 hours. I can&#x27;t ask for anything else. Great product!  One funny note... This stuff smells pretty good as well! The first time I put it on, my wife came out and joined me a few hours later and kept saying &amp;#34;I smell hot chocolate!&amp;#34; So, I let her smell my arm and she said &amp;#34;That&#x27;s what I smell...&amp;#34; To me, it smells like vanilla. Either way, better than that disgusting smell of DEET!</li>
            <li> We used this product when taking safari tours in Negril, Jamaica. Not one bug bite the whole week. As a matter of fact, my sister-in-law came into our resort room just after we applied it and were about to leave. She asked what kind of good smelling room deodorizer we were using. Bug Spray ! You&#x27;re Kidding !</li>
            <li> I am the type of bug magnet that people love to take with, because when I am around nobody else gets bitten. If there is a bug within 100 yards, it will be near me. Know this, entomologists!! Bring your nets.&lt;br /&gt;Although, of course, now I know about Skedattle. So the bugs do come to me (they do adore me, after all) but.. they don&#x27;t land. They don&#x27;t touch me. They stay a distance, confused, wondering what is going on.&lt;br /&gt;Skedattle smells heavenly too. I put it on my very long, curly hair and on my clothes (doesn&#x27;t stain), spray my shoes (haven&#x27;t tried leather) and I do not fear smelling like a chemical factory. I smell of natural oils and I&#x27;ve gotten not a few comments on that. What&#x27;s not to like?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy 4-6 of these things, keep them in the car, in the garage, in your luggage.  The outdoors is yours!!</li>
            <li> Actually smells nice and works pretty well.</li>
            <li> so far it seems to work fine. My son does not love the smell but I apply it on him anyways.</li>
            <li> Does a great job and its allowed in Mexican eco parks Xcaret and Xel-Ha</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  I like that it&#x27;s all natural with no chemicals.  It keeps all bugs away and smells good too!</li>
            <li> Vacationed in Wisconsin - the ticks were awful - this spray - protected my family from mosquito bites and ticks great - not one bite - smells good too!!  Purchased more - for next future trips.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!!!!! I get HUGE welts from mosquitos and fleas and have suffered all summer until getting this product!! Works amazingly well and smells nice.  You DO have to reapply afer perspiring, thought. I have no problems with this.</li>
            <li> works well and I live in maine</li>
            <li> Great product. We visited an area in Mexico where products have to be biodegradable. This bug spray fit the bill and worked well!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all, smells really strong!</li>
            <li> I already left a review for this product.  The entire bottle is very sticky even though it was wrapped in a zip lock bag. It&#x27;s as if it&#x27;s leaking.  It&#x27;s stinking up my luggage.  I can&#x27;t speak of the product but the one that i got is defective. I can&#x27;t use this and i&#x27;m travelling next week. There&#x27;s no time for me to return this or exchange it. Not very happy.&lt;br /&gt;I tried washing the bottle and left it outside to see if I can air it out, but that smell just won&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li> This is 100% ineffective at keeping mosquitoes &#x27; away! Do NOT waste your money! I sprayed continously and watched them land right on my skin and bite me. Horrible peoduct!</li>
            <li> I love this product, its smells great so you don&#x27;t smell funny. It works great for me, this is the first mosquito repellant I&#x27;ve found that works for me.  Most times I use the normal brands (Off) I stink and I still get eaten. Love this stuff and to know that its ECO friendly is even better.</li>
            <li> I like it and it smells good</li>
            <li> I love knowing this is completely natural, with no worrisome or foul-smelling chemicals.  Made from a combination of Peppermint Oil, Lemongrass Oil and Citronella, it smells pretty awesome!  I think it works pretty well too.  I still got a couple of bites outside after I used it, but I think that has also happened even with Off or Deet, perhaps on spots that were missed when I sprayed myself.  Overall I am very pleased not to use the horrible chemicals anymore. I only wish that healthy alternatives weren&#x27;t more expensive than their unhealthy counterparts.</li>
            <li> Took it on our trip to the Yucatan.  Had no problems with bugs.</li>
            <li> My wife is constantly bothered by mosquitos and other biting insects.  So, my nephew brought Skedattle to the lake where we spent a week and sprayed it around.  We sat out around a campfire most of the night, singing and listening to music and my wife was not bitten once.  When we got home I ordered a bottle and can tell you we&#x27;ll definitely keep this product on hand.  We travel a lot with our RV and like the outdoors and this product will definitely let us stay out longer.  Thanks for an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not thrilled about putting DEET and other repellents on my skin -- I&#x27;m not super-clean about artificial chemicals, but why expose more than necessary? -- but I live on open acreage with deep grass and trees, where dense clouds of mosquitoes can swarm visibly even at midday and where ticks thrive. And if I want to walk along a local creek? For years I&#x27;ve been compromising by spraying my clothes only, with mixed success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I was curious but skeptical about this product, which sounded a little too good to be true. I figured I&#x27;d try it once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried it in deep tick territory yet, but I can say that I walked last night through twilight and beyond and got not a single mosquito bite. The bugs were out -- I heard them whining about my head -- but no bites. This was my second test run, with zero bites thus far. (I am still sporting the bites from previous outings without repellent.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the scent goes.... Yes, it has a scent. Of course it has a scent, it&#x27;s composed of citronella, lemongrass, and peppermint oils, among other things. Whether the scent is too strong or too distasteful is going to be a personal call, but I don&#x27;t find it unpleasant. It is a bit strong, but that fades relatively quickly, and it&#x27;s certainly a better smell than a traditional bug repellent spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will edit my review if I find it does not repel ticks, but for the moment, I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised by this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this before my trip to Thailand. Riding the train that was full of mosquitos and I was the only one in the group not getting bit, all the guys with Deep Woods Off were asking me to use Skedattle after 30 minutes of theirs not working. I&#x27;ve been using it ever since. I&#x27;ve tried lots of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; brands none work or smell as good as this!</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time this weekend while camping and it worked great! I really like the smell, it dried quickly and the bugs stayed away. It was nice to know that it&#x27;s an environmentally safe product with no harsh chemicals. I plan to use it on an upcoming visit to Belize and Roatan so we can wear it before snorkeling and not damage the reef with chemicals. The delivery was fast and the product arrived as promised. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This repellant smells amazing, and without anything harsh and chemically.  Its almost like a really pleasant citronella candle with vanilla woven in.  When I wore it I did not get bit, though I haven&#x27;t tested it on the full gamut of tiny forest &#x27;wildlife&#x27; yet.  Not being bit is the aim, however, and thus far its working like a charm...</li>
            <li> When I put other repellents on my dog runs and hides from me.  She is OK with this!  While she doesn&#x27;t like the spray, she lets me put it on her.</li>
