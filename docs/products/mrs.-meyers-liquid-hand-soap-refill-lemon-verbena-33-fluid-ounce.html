            <li>I love this hand soap.  </li>
            <li>Wonderfully gentle soap in a great packaging.</li>
            <li>The soap lathers nicely and leaves  a clean scent.</li>
            <li>But these sellers were good too, so whatever is more convenient for what you&#x27;re willing to pay.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery good smell</li>
            <li>It smells great, really light and clean, and is really gentle on my hands.</li>
            <li>and I love the earth friendly product</li>
            <li>It arrived very quickly, thank you.</li>
            <li>and they come to my house quickly!</li>
            <li>It smells so fresh and has been great for my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>I found these a lot cheaper on Mrs. Meyers&#x27; website - free shipping over $50 there.  </li>
            <li>The hands feel refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li>And it was nice to be able to buy the larger bottles so that I could just refill the ones that I have now.</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite soap right now!</li>
            <li>Smells great but expected a thicker liquid.</li>

            <li>Thanks Mrs. Meyers!</li>
            <li>I love the scent and it doesn&#x27;t dry the skin.</li>
            <li>Easy to fill smaller soap dispensers in your home or business.</li>
            <li>It is gentle and nonirritating.</li>
            <li>I really like this dish soap.</li>
            <li>Gentle on hands.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper on their web site,however.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the scent</li>
            <li>Nice smell not too heavy.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I found similar product at Whole Foods toay for $11.99!</li>
            <li>I love knowing that I am using less plastic by refilling from larger containers.</li>
            <li>It is concerning to me that the liquid has a yellowish hue, when I know it should be a clear color as the ones I&#x27;ve purchased before were clear.  </li>
            <li>Our customers appreciate the calming natural aroma.</li>

            <li> Everything as expected....</li>
            <li> I especially like the lilac scent which is hard to find as it is seasonal.</li>
            <li> (though not the typical lavender I&#x27;m used to).  </li>
            <li> Convenient sized refills that pour without mess.</li>
            <li> but I think my hands are always a little softer after using this product.</li>
            <li> Ordering these refills in bulk helps me to save a little money</li>
            <li> No more harsh chemicals on my hands with either the hand soap or the dishwasher soap.</li>
            <li> We use this hand soap since year, we usually purchase the bottles.&lt;br /&gt;The refill size is much less expensive and the soap is the same ...</li>
            <li> I bought a two pack from Amazon before purchasing this one and unfortunately I am not pleased with it this time around.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m afraid it could simply be old soap.  </li>
            <li> The scent is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and while this soap doesn&#x27;t cure it, it doesn&#x27;t make it worse.</li>
            <li> In addition, it doesn&#x27;t contain all of the nasty stuff</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I ordered lavendar but received olive oil &amp; aloe vera. Can&#x27;t recommend this scent. Yuck</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using Mrs. Meyers lavender hand soap for years. I think it&#x27;s the best liquid hand soap there is. At least it&#x27;s the best of all the ones I&#x27;ve ever used. If you&#x27;ve found a liquid hand soap you prefer, please leave a comment. I&#x27;d like to try it. We have dispensers in all our bathrooms and at the kitchen sink. I have psoriasis and while this soap doesn&#x27;t cure it, it doesn&#x27;t make it worse. It&#x27;s not advertised as being a moisturizing soap but I think my hands are always a little softer after using this product.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product</li>

            <li> best soap on the planet, great value</li>
            <li> Love,love,love these products. I especially like the lilac scent which is hard to find as it is seasonal. No more harsh chemicals on my hands with either the hand soap or the dishwasher soap. Much cheaper on their web site,however.</li>
            <li> I love this product. And it was nice to be able to buy the larger bottles so that I could just refill the ones that I have now.</li>
            <li> Awesome product for your house and environment!</li>
            <li> The product itself is great. The package of the item, not so great. When I placed my order the item exploded during shipping.</li>
            <li> Love this scent! Guests love it too</li>
            <li> I love this hand soap.  I bought the initial soaps on sale at WholeFoods and the refills on Amazon. The price is great. The seller is also great (the products were in excellent, new, wrapped condition).  Scent is fragrant and nice (though not the typical lavender I&#x27;m used to).  Highly recommended. UPDATE:  I found these a lot cheaper on Mrs. Meyers&#x27; website - free shipping over $50 there.  But these sellers were good too, so whatever is more convenient for what you&#x27;re willing to pay.</li>
            <li> Only use this for hand soap.</li>
            <li> Best hand soap ever. Doesn&#x27;t dry my hands as other soaps do.</li>
            <li> This lasts forever. A good 6-8 month supply for kitchen and 2 baths.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this product. Of course, the quality is excellent. The pricing is SO out of range. I found similar product at Whole Foods toay for $11.99!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the scent but I will use it sense I ordered two. It cleans well, but dries the hands.</li>
            <li> Wonderfully gentle soap in a great packaging. Easy to fill smaller soap dispensers in your home or business. Nice soft smell of lavender, nothing over powering. Great price!</li>
            <li> I love knowing that I am using less plastic by refilling from larger containers.</li>
