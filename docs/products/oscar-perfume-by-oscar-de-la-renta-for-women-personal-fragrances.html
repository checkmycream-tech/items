            <li>I was very excited to see it available through Amazon at such a great price.</li>

            <li>Oscar by Oscar de la Renta for Women is a fabulous scent.  </li>
            <li>While we were talking the stewardess was making her rounds selling duty free items.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light floral and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I will enjoy it, and know that I can buy it again.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ll enjoy it.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to see Oscar for the low price on Amazon.  </li>

            <li>Very efficient care of delivery and valuable price!!!</li>
            <li>It was easy to do, received quickly and at a competitive price.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.&lt;br</li>

            <li>Original product and box.</li>
            <li>It is not overpowering and makes you feel special.  </li>
            <li>special :&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>What at pleasant surprise to find my favorite fragrance at half the price of the retail stores...</li>
            <li>This size is a great value for the cost,easy to handle, and not a real floral scent.</li>
            <li>Great price- delivered as expected.</li>
            <li>My mom loves this stuff and she says it&#x27;s harder to find now, so getting here was great.</li>
            <li>and I was faced with going without or paying full price.  </li>
            <li>Glad to find it at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what people where complaining about it is the full strength version</li>
            <li>Hence, I know what the true fragrance is or should be.  </li>
            <li>and I was issued a full refund.  </li>
            <li>It has a soft floral scent with hints of rose.</li>
            <li>It stays a nice soft scent, never overpowering -</li>
            <li>Bought this for my mom because it&#x27;s her favorite perfume, she really likes it.</li>
            <li>Oscar De La Renta is a very fragrant perfume, and I just love it.  </li>
            <li>Love the dusting powder but it too high for my budget!</li>
            <li>Perfect as usual!</li>
            <li>Very large bottle for a cheap price.</li>
            <li>Love the new fragance (for me)!</li>
            <li>It also has a clean fresh sent.  </li>
            <li>shipped quickly and we had no problems.</li>
            <li>Now that I am having trouble finding this product locally, it is so good to be able to depend on Amazon.  </li>

            <li>Well worth the purchase.  </li>
            <li>All in all, well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worn Oscar for twenty years it last and stands out as a nice fragrance</li>
            <li>It is a bit pricey but worth it.</li>

            <li>Shipping and delivery was very fast, as always.  </li>
            <li>this offer was a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Price and delivery service are very important with me and Amazon is the only place I buy my Oscar.</li>
            <li>with free shipping, no less!  </li>
            <li>I was so pleased that I was able to purchase it through Amazon at the same low price.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have bought this perfume from here, and am not satified with the staying power.  </li>
            <li>This does not smell the same as the fragrance I love.  </li>
            <li>The bottle that arrived today is exactly like all the others I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>The product arrived on time and was exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>Been wearing this same perfume since college and still love it.</li>
            <li>Received exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>There are only two scents that I absolutely love and this is one of them.  </li>
            <li>REAL  deal !&lt;</li>
            <li>but from the first time I used it.....</li>
            <li>the spray works fine......just have to put the top together to put it back on.  </li>
            <li>it arrived exactly when they told me it would  </li>
            <li>Am I stuck - yes, but never fail to get a favorable comment...</li>
            <li>It never fails that someone will ask &#x27;What are you wearing&#x27;?.</li>
            <li>Came on time, well packaged, timely, the product was exactly as described online.</li>
            <li>bottle will last for more than a year.</li>
            <li>Will look to order more in the future as its my wife fave.</li>
            <li>Thanks, item was as advertised!  </li>
            <li>Was worth the gamble, thanks.</li>
            <li>The scent is so different, and I have had so many compliments from passersby when wearing it.</li>
            <li>I have been in love with this scent for over 30 years, matter of fact it is the only fragrance I use.  </li>
            <li>I used it a few years ago and loved it</li>
            <li>I always get this on Amazon because the price if right and delivery is fast.  </li>
            <li>Also noted, that my original Oscar&#x27;s top was sold black.  </li>
            <li>But it totally is and we were not disappointed at all!</li>
            <li>I have been wearing Oscar de la Renta for years and was able to purchase it from a local wholesale club for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>it will most likely be much appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>She really like this, and it&#x27;s authentic so this will last quite some time</li>
            <li>The color was also much lighter and the smell seems to have a higher alcohol smell.  </li>
            <li>My wife has been getting Oscar from Amazon for a few years and has been very pleased with the product till this time.  </li>
            <li>And no, my wife is not intersted in the perfectly fine generic version of Oscar.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Never is this long standing favorite on sale at local department stores, so Amazon.com&#x27;s price is nearly TWO bottles, for the price of ONE at most local department store prices, with free shipping &amp; no tax</li>
            <li>This is my favorite product and I have a hard time finding it in the big bottle---this is an amazing price</li>
            <li>Thanks again, Amazon.</li>
            <li>I really like the scent.</li>
            <li>Packaged well - fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Items purchased were very well accepted by the persons receiving them.  </li>
            <li>It arrived in 24 hours, now that&#x27;s fast.</li>
            <li>and it was very well received.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.  </li>
            <li>She mentioned wanting to try it again, but didn&#x27;t know how much it would cost.</li>
            <li>you can smell it yourself,  you have &amp;#34;TOO  MUCH</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>and she doesn&#x27;t use much.  </li>
            <li>Scent is very flattering.</li>
            <li>No problems and much cheaper than anywhere else.</li>
            <li>thanks , Diane Dukes</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft sensual and sexy all at the same time.  </li>
            <li>It is not an overbearing aroma, but rather subtle and pleasant.</li>
            <li>I was so excited about being able to order the perfume I use Oscar as it is hard to find it in stores here.  </li>
            <li>and my husband does like it better than any other fragrance that I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>Better than any other store in the area.</li>
            <li>I have used this fragrance for over 40 years and receive more compliments then any other fragrance I have worn.</li>
            <li>it makes me feel extra special when I get dressed up and go out.</li>
            <li>I sprayed my old product on my other wrist and it definitely had the pleasant smell that I associate with Oscar and have worn for years.  </li>
            <li>I have used this perfume for approx 30 yrs and plan on staying with it as long as it is available.  </li>
            <li>Both men and women tell me I small nice.</li>
            <li>It is  a classic.  </li>
            <li>what can i say classic never die</li>
            <li>This perfume is still the classic essence of Oscar De La Renta.  </li>
            <li>On this particular flight I was going to Switzerland and was joined by a woman who was on her way to Paris France for a one man</li>
            <li>A timeless classic.</li>
            <li>this product doesnt smell like the real perfume, it smells good but not the same as this perfume usually smells</li>
            <li>My wife uses this perfume for over 30 years and is definitely not the original essence, has trouble fixing and evaporates very fast unlike the original.</li>
            <li>I received the item a few days ahead of schedule, which was perfect as I had used the last of my previous bottle the morning.</li>
            <li>Fully packaged but smells old, the alcohol  content very pronounced.</li>
            <li>Soft , gentle, lovely&lt;br /&gt;The one perfume I know for FACT</li>
            <li>She was thrilled with it to say the least.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the product you sent me has been sitting in a warehouse or something for a long  time because the fragrance of the bottle you sent me isn&#x27;t even close to the true fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It never goes unnoticed followed by a lovely compliment..</li>
            <li>I rarely wear a different fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I suspect this new product to be a knock-off.  </li>
            <li>My new wife loves it and some friends that picked up the scent on her</li>
            <li>It is very soft and fragrant, but never overbearing.</li>
            <li>I paid half of what I pay in fine department stores.</li>
            <li>Product is OLD and does NOT have scent of OSCAR!</li>
            <li>This is the only perfume I wear and it never fails to bring compliments.</li>
            <li>This is the only fragrance I wear that I consistently get compliments on.  </li>
            <li>It is both my everyday and special occasion perfume!  </li>
            <li>I would certainly order it again when my supply gets low.</li>
            <li>My favorite perfume, and its hard to find, I get compliments when I wear it</li>
            <li>Lately I have been getting more compliments on it then ever before.  </li>
            <li>which is another cost savings with nearly $4 per gallon gas prices.</li>
            <li>I like that it is soft and floral.  </li>
            <li>Definitely not the real deal.  </li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe this is the real Oscar, as the scent does not last at all!</li>
            <li>Looks just like old bottle with updated appliqu&amp;eacute;s.</li>
            <li>Since she was a very suffocated individual I took her advice.</li>
            <li>She still had some of her old one</li>
            <li>I ordered Oscar De La Renta because I&#x27;ve used it for a few years and enjoy the fragrance.</li>
            <li>young and have used Oscar for years.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That remind me when we were young teenagers and scape from the party&#x27;s to do something else, that smell</li>
            <li>I love the subtle fragrance.</li>
            <li>The first 2pics are the fake with an emblem in the glass and gold top.</li>
            <li>I received this quickly and at half the price.</li>
            <li>I hope you all do look into this major flaw !&lt;</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted and expected.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>It does not smell exactly like Oscar and the fragrance does not last as long.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, Amazon will be my first stop from now on for sweet smelling Oscar!</li>
            <li>I was surprised how big the bottle was.</li>
            <li>This cologne is an old standard.  </li>
            <li>I wear this everyday because it doesn&#x27;t smell as fresh.</li>
            <li>It is a fresh, youthful aroma- not too heavy.</li>
            <li>I purchased this identical product from Amazon several months ago and still had some left when my new purchase arrived.  </li>
            <li>I reseve my order in the mail and much to my dis-may it was something by Oscar in a blue bottle that smelled like oranges and said limited addtion on the bottle.</li>
            <li>I usually buy it at Macy&#x27;s at Christmas time and it is always fresh there.</li>
            <li>Paid twice as much for half the amount at our local store.</li>

            <li> My mom loves this stuff and she says it&#x27;s harder to find now, so getting here was great.</li>
            <li> and I was faced with going without or paying full price.  </li>
            <li> Glad to find it at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what people where complaining about it is the full strength version</li>
            <li> Hence, I know what the true fragrance is or should be.  </li>
            <li> and I was issued a full refund.  </li>
            <li> It has a soft floral scent with hints of rose.</li>
            <li> It stays a nice soft scent, never overpowering -</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom because it&#x27;s her favorite perfume, she really likes it.</li>
            <li> Oscar De La Renta is a very fragrant perfume, and I just love it.  </li>

            <li> All in all, well worth the money.</li>

            <li> Shipping and delivery was very fast, as always.  </li>
            <li> this offer was a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Price and delivery service are very important with me and Amazon is the only place I buy my Oscar.</li>
            <li> with free shipping, no less!  </li>
            <li> I was so pleased that I was able to purchase it through Amazon at the same low price.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have bought this perfume from here, and am not satified with the staying power.  </li>
            <li> This does not smell the same as the fragrance I love.  </li>
            <li> The bottle that arrived today is exactly like all the others I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and was exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Been wearing this same perfume since college and still love it.</li>
            <li> Received exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> There are only two scents that I absolutely love and this is one of them.  </li>
            <li> REAL  deal !&lt;</li>
            <li> but from the first time I used it.....</li>
            <li> the spray works fine......just have to put the top together to put it back on.  </li>
            <li> it arrived exactly when they told me it would  </li>
            <li> Am I stuck - yes, but never fail to get a favorable comment...</li>
            <li> It never fails that someone will ask &#x27;What are you wearing&#x27;?.</li>
            <li> Came on time, well packaged, timely, the product was exactly as described online.</li>
            <li> bottle will last for more than a year.</li>
            <li> Will look to order more in the future as its my wife fave.</li>
            <li> Thanks, item was as advertised!  </li>
            <li> Was worth the gamble, thanks.</li>
            <li> The scent is so different, and I have had so many compliments from passersby when wearing it.</li>
            <li> I have been in love with this scent for over 30 years, matter of fact it is the only fragrance I use.  </li>
            <li> I used it a few years ago and loved it</li>
            <li> I always get this on Amazon because the price if right and delivery is fast.  </li>
            <li> Also noted, that my original Oscar&#x27;s top was sold black.  </li>
            <li> But it totally is and we were not disappointed at all!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Oscar de la Renta for years and was able to purchase it from a local wholesale club for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> it will most likely be much appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> She really like this, and it&#x27;s authentic so this will last quite some time</li>
            <li> The color was also much lighter and the smell seems to have a higher alcohol smell.  </li>
            <li> My wife has been getting Oscar from Amazon for a few years and has been very pleased with the product till this time.  </li>
            <li> And no, my wife is not intersted in the perfectly fine generic version of Oscar.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Never is this long standing favorite on sale at local department stores, so Amazon.com&#x27;s price is nearly TWO bottles, for the price of ONE at most local department store prices, with free shipping &amp; no tax</li>
            <li> This is my favorite product and I have a hard time finding it in the big bottle---this is an amazing price</li>
            <li> Thanks again, Amazon.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent.</li>
            <li> Packaged well - fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Items purchased were very well accepted by the persons receiving them.  </li>
            <li> It arrived in 24 hours, now that&#x27;s fast.</li>
            <li> and it was very well received.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.  </li>
            <li> She mentioned wanting to try it again, but didn&#x27;t know how much it would cost.</li>
            <li> you can smell it yourself,  you have &amp;#34;TOO  MUCH</li>
            <li> Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> and she doesn&#x27;t use much.  </li>
            <li> Scent is very flattering.</li>
            <li> No problems and much cheaper than anywhere else.</li>
            <li> thanks , Diane Dukes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft sensual and sexy all at the same time.  </li>
            <li> It is not an overbearing aroma, but rather subtle and pleasant.</li>
            <li> I was so excited about being able to order the perfume I use Oscar as it is hard to find it in stores here.  </li>
            <li> and my husband does like it better than any other fragrance that I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> Better than any other store in the area.</li>
            <li> I have used this fragrance for over 40 years and receive more compliments then any other fragrance I have worn.</li>
            <li> it makes me feel extra special when I get dressed up and go out.</li>
            <li> I sprayed my old product on my other wrist and it definitely had the pleasant smell that I associate with Oscar and have worn for years.  </li>
            <li> I have used this perfume for approx 30 yrs and plan on staying with it as long as it is available.  </li>
            <li> Both men and women tell me I small nice.</li>
            <li> It is  a classic.  </li>
            <li> what can i say classic never die</li>
            <li> This perfume is still the classic essence of Oscar De La Renta.  </li>
            <li> On this particular flight I was going to Switzerland and was joined by a woman who was on her way to Paris France for a one man</li>
            <li> A timeless classic.</li>
            <li> this product doesnt smell like the real perfume, it smells good but not the same as this perfume usually smells</li>
            <li> My wife uses this perfume for over 30 years and is definitely not the original essence, has trouble fixing and evaporates very fast unlike the original.</li>
            <li> I received the item a few days ahead of schedule, which was perfect as I had used the last of my previous bottle the morning.</li>
            <li> Fully packaged but smells old, the alcohol  content very pronounced.</li>
            <li> Soft , gentle, lovely&lt;br /&gt;The one perfume I know for FACT</li>
            <li> She was thrilled with it to say the least.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the product you sent me has been sitting in a warehouse or something for a long  time because the fragrance of the bottle you sent me isn&#x27;t even close to the true fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It never goes unnoticed followed by a lovely compliment..</li>
            <li> I rarely wear a different fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I suspect this new product to be a knock-off.  </li>
            <li> My new wife loves it and some friends that picked up the scent on her</li>
            <li> It is very soft and fragrant, but never overbearing.</li>
            <li> I paid half of what I pay in fine department stores.</li>
            <li> Product is OLD and does NOT have scent of OSCAR!</li>
            <li> This is the only perfume I wear and it never fails to bring compliments.</li>
            <li> This is the only fragrance I wear that I consistently get compliments on.  </li>
            <li> It is both my everyday and special occasion perfume!  </li>
            <li> I would certainly order it again when my supply gets low.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume, and its hard to find, I get compliments when I wear it</li>
            <li> Lately I have been getting more compliments on it then ever before.  </li>
            <li> which is another cost savings with nearly $4 per gallon gas prices.</li>
            <li> I like that it is soft and floral.  </li>
            <li> Definitely not the real deal.  </li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe this is the real Oscar, as the scent does not last at all!</li>
            <li> Looks just like old bottle with updated appliqu&amp;eacute;s.</li>
            <li> Since she was a very suffocated individual I took her advice.</li>
            <li> She still had some of her old one</li>
            <li> I ordered Oscar De La Renta because I&#x27;ve used it for a few years and enjoy the fragrance.</li>
            <li> young and have used Oscar for years.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That remind me when we were young teenagers and scape from the party&#x27;s to do something else, that smell</li>
            <li> I love the subtle fragrance.</li>
            <li> The first 2pics are the fake with an emblem in the glass and gold top.</li>
            <li> I received this quickly and at half the price.</li>
            <li> I hope you all do look into this major flaw !&lt;</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted and expected.  </li>
            <li> It was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> It does not smell exactly like Oscar and the fragrance does not last as long.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, Amazon will be my first stop from now on for sweet smelling Oscar!</li>
            <li> I was surprised how big the bottle was.</li>
            <li> This cologne is an old standard.  </li>
            <li> I wear this everyday because it doesn&#x27;t smell as fresh.</li>
            <li> It is a fresh, youthful aroma- not too heavy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this identical product from Amazon several months ago and still had some left when my new purchase arrived.  </li>
            <li> I reseve my order in the mail and much to my dis-may it was something by Oscar in a blue bottle that smelled like oranges and said limited addtion on the bottle.</li>
            <li> I usually buy it at Macy&#x27;s at Christmas time and it is always fresh there.</li>
            <li> Paid twice as much for half the amount at our local store.</li>
            <li> This is a long time favorite of mine that is difficult to find locally.</li>
            <li> My only complaint, if you want to call it that, is that it took exactly 2 weeks from the date I ordered it for it to arrive.</li>
            <li> It smell also doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as the last bottle either!</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t last long, it actually last all day</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell a difference in this and my purchases in the past 30 years......</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s simple and delicate I actually thought it would be a very lite sent whch</li>
            <li> Have used it for years &amp; never grown tired of it:  Not overly sweet, nor too musky.</li>
            <li> I loved the price, but disappointed in what I received.  </li>
            <li> I purchased it from amazon not some other seller and it is exactly like the bottle that I usually buy from the local Walgreen&#x27;s but for a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy to get this particular scent, unless you&#x27;re willing to pay some ridiculous price at places like Macy&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Very soft not strong at all.  </li>
            <li> I have to say it smelled a little old.</li>
            <li> The perfume that I purchased smelled the way it should (ie, not old or rancid), was the size and brand</li>
            <li> and it lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> It also arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> It came when I expected it and everything was terrific.</li>
            <li> one of my long time favorites</li>
            <li> It is one she used to wear a long time ago before we got together.</li>
            <li> This has been my signature fragrance for so long that I can&#x27;t remember when I didn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> Does this make me strange?  </li>
            <li> The price on Amazon was well below several other sites</li>
            <li> I have tried other fragrances, but have not found any to equal the softness, and delight of OSCAR.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is not new to me.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff, and it&#x27;s half the price we were paying at our local department store.</li>
            <li> Now it is only half that.</li>
            <li> I knew it was a fake when I saw the lid and the scent is extremely mild.</li>
            <li> Very alcohol smelling and weak.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s for my 92 year old grandmother and hard to find.</li>
            <li> not some water down one or an imitation, and thankfully not the blue one!  </li>
            <li> My wife said she paid around $80 for the same size bottle back in the late 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The product is just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected and well packaged.</li>
            <li> Product was as expected.  </li>
            <li> Their always were empty seats in the business section on the plane so I would go and sit in one of the empty seats to have a smoke.</li>
            <li> It was delivered on time and the product was as expected.</li>
            <li> She ordered 2 bottles this time and the first one that she opened seems very weak - the scent.  </li>
            <li> and then they sell it to other stores because of the freshness.  </li>
            <li> In thirty years of buying this perfume from other sources......this has never happen.</li>
            <li> size costs at the store and other outlets.  </li>
            <li> Have tried other fragrances but  OSCAR DE LA RENTA</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other scents, but my body chemistry changes the frangrance to stink.</li>
            <li> Would recommend that other women buy it.  </li>
            <li> My husband found it on Amazon.com and spent less money than purchasing at the dept. store.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not right.</li>
            <li> To spend that kinda money and be treated this way its just not worth my time</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the bottle can not be opened and decanted into another perfume bottle.</li>
            <li> Much too expensive in the department stores.</li>
            <li> I know about packaging changes over time, but the Oscar fragrance must have been watered down.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical since some of the reviews stated that this wasn&#x27;t the real deal.</li>
            <li> The price is less than half of</li>
            <li> This Bottle does not quite smell like the previous bottle that I purchased from another site.  </li>
            <li> Slight powdery floral.</li>
            <li> AT BLACK FRIDAY</li>
            <li> This fragrance is not original.</li>
            <li> But, since I cannot get my wife to wear it, I spray a little of it on my pillow at night.  </li>
            <li> A little bit heavier perfume</li>
            <li> they have it down!</li>
            <li> Keep the price down for us retiree&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> Upon opening it and using it it lasted just a few minutes and did not stay with me like the one I was still using here.</li>
            <li> Convenient &amp; practical shopping with a few clicks of the mouse &amp; no need to drive</li>
            <li> and a waste of time and</li>
            <li> $35 for this is half of what it would be in a store!  </li>
            <li> Stinks like what one might refer to as old ladies perfume!  </li>
            <li> If I am not wearing this scent, I fell like part of my identity is missing!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this and has used it for the past 15 years.</li>
            <li> unbelievable...  </li>
            <li> it cause it&#x27;s not overwhelming when I put it</li>
            <li> I opened the new spray and sprayed it on one wrist and noticed that it had a somewhat unpleasant smell.  </li>
            <li> So disappointed as I opened this bottle of a cologne I order regularly from you  ......  too late to attempt to send it back, ..</li>
            <li> I remarried again when I lost my late wife.</li>
            <li> I have 1980 used this since at least.  </li>
            <li> No more of this stuff for me!</li>
            <li> with very few results !  </li>
            <li> The scent is subtle and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> Sorry to say, I wasted my money on a rip</li>
            <li> The perfume practically has no fragrance and to make things worse when I tried to return it</li>
            <li> You do not leave a trail behind you.</li>
            <li> You can call me a very disappointed old lady and I am telling my friends about my experience.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so expensive in the stores.</li>
            <li> but it is so expensive in the stores.  </li>
            <li> Just never got it because it was so expensive at stores.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I don&#x27;t bother.  </li>
            <li> This Oscar de la Renta perfume is a fake.  </li>
            <li> I use it sparingly because it has been so expensive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> It has been somewhat difficult to find on occasion.</li>
            <li> I ordered the wrong fragrance, I gave it away to my sister as a gift.</li>
            <li> We expected the perfume as per the diagram mentioned for the product.&lt;br /&gt;Name of the product and diagram are not matching.&lt;br /&gt;We are very disappointed with it.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I get a promt that it cannot be returned because it&#x27;s classified as containing dangerous materials</li>
            <li> (the perfume being the dangerous materials)  </li>
            <li> Sorry :(</li>
            <li> I was about to order Jean Patoe a very expensive perfume.</li>
            <li> For the price you pay is not so bad.</li>
            <li> Kinda disappointed in that.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Amazon did credit me immediately, but I was still disappointed as this was a Mother&#x27;s day gift that will never get used. :-(</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> was I disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I hate to be an accuser, but I feel that I have been ripped off by a take off on Oscar.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very frustrated!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointment the store selling this!!!!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This item was a gift, however, I have purchased this item before for myself and it is very nice, Osca de la renta is my favorite</li>
            <li> I knew it was a fake when I saw the lid and the scent is extremely mild. The first 2pics are the fake with an emblem in the glass and gold top.</li>
            <li> I love Oscar and that is my favorite perfume. However at this price, I thought I would give it a try.  I have to say it smelled a little old. I usually buy it at Macy&#x27;s at Christmas time and it is always fresh there. The sells person told me once that they will only keep their product 6 months and then they sell it to other stores because of the freshness.  I wear this everyday because it doesn&#x27;t smell as fresh. The price is about 1/3 of Macy&#x27;s price though. You have to pick your preference, super smell or great price.</li>
            <li> My mother loves the price for this (her favorite) perfume!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this since 1987 and still love it....</li>
            <li> love it it is a huge bottle and great cost</li>
            <li> Is a great perfume, try to buy always the original, never the fake ones, is a great deal for a great price</li>
            <li> I love Oscar and so does my sister. This was a gift for my sister. There was  not a card included  with the gift.&lt;br /&gt;She didn&#x27;t know who sent it to her. Kinda disappointed in that.&lt;br /&gt;But thanks f or the special delivery. She  did get it on her birthday.</li>
            <li> My favorite!!!!  Amazon.com has it for the best price and I looked around everywhere.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Oscar de la Renta for years and was able to purchase it from a local wholesale club for a reasonable price.  However, they discontinued it and I was faced with going without or paying full price.  I was so pleased that I was able to purchase it through Amazon at the same low price.</li>
            <li> When my husband was shopping for my annual Christmas fragrance, I thought to check Amazon...What at pleasant surprise to find my favorite fragrance at half the price of the retail stores...with free shipping, no less!  Needless to say, Amazon will be my first stop from now on for sweet smelling Oscar!</li>
            <li> The product is just what I expected. Great transaction</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite perfume!!!! My husband loves it as well!</li>
            <li> absolutely the best!!</li>
            <li> Excellent transaction, with no surprises.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff. My wife has been using this for years. These folks had the best deal going at the time the purchase was made.&lt;br /&gt;They shipped quickly and we had no problems.</li>
            <li> Product as described! Arrived as expected and well packaged. Made a Great gift !!!</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted and expected.  And I received it promptl!</li>
            <li> this is my third write up if it disappears again will not do it again. The price is what drew me in and it looked identical so ordered it. It came looked the same. Upon opening it and using it it lasted just a few minutes and did not stay with me like the one I was still using here.I feel it is not the same. The price is less than half of anywhere else I should have known just by that. I have used Amazon and I trusted when you sent me to Tuccini to buy it. Wont do that again.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled with my purchase of Oscar De La Renta..........Delivery was on time, and the product was as advertised......</li>
            <li> One of my favorite all time scents!</li>
            <li> My favorite scent and arrived on time and at a great price!</li>
            <li> My mom&#x27;s favorite! That says it all at a great price.</li>
            <li> Now that I am having trouble finding this product locally, it is so good to be able to depend on Amazon.  This is an excellent fragrance and I was pleased with the price.  Thanks again, Amazon.</li>
            <li> On time and everything great. will buy again when my wife need more perfume thanks</li>
            <li> I placed an $88.00 order with this company for Oscar by Oscar De La Renta...I reseve my order in the mail and much to my dis-may it was something by Oscar in a blue bottle that smelled like oranges and said limited addtion on the bottle. I bought this for my grandmother because this is all that she has wore for 30years...so I wrote the company they said I had to pay the cost to send it back!!! To spend that kinda money and be treated this way its just not worth my time so I have let my friends and family know what has happen I have forwarded them the emails from this company and I can safely say that they nor myself will ever order from this company ever ever again! They do not want to take the chance on being scammed so that is why im writting this so this way nobody else can be scammed either.</li>
            <li> My scent.  Glad to find it at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> always a fantastic fragrance!</li>
            <li> The perfume that I purchased smelled the way it should (ie, not old or rancid), was the size and brand I ordered, and while shipping was not speedy, neither was it slow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase from the seller again without question.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance! Loved the service feom Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is a long time favorite of mine that is difficult to find locally. This size is a great value for the cost,easy to handle, and not a real floral scent. I really like the scent. It is not over powering. Try it.</li>
            <li> Lovely scent. Packaged well - fast delivery. excellent price.</li>
            <li> Always pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Have worn this fragrance for 18 years.  I  have tried others but I keep coming back to this one.  I  have gotten  so  many compliments&lt;br /&gt;this fragrance.</li>
            <li> Got this  for myself  better price  than  the  stores. The  size is  perfect</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and accurate.  Product is my favorite.  Could not find it locally any cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Oscar for more than 30 yrs.  If the product wasn&#x27;t good, it wouldn&#x27;t still be on the market.</li>
            <li> Great perfume my wife and sister love it.</li>
            <li> Gentlemen, I wonder when they will make the refund of the purchase on my credit card issued in May, because they never received the product.&lt;br /&gt; Thank you</li>
            <li> Perfect! &amp;. A bargain to boot.</li>
            <li> Perfect gift for my mother&#x27;s Christmas.  This product was a quality gift at a great price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this perfume for a very good friend of mine.  She was thrilled with it to say the least.  I love it so much that I bought myself one!  I love the way it gives you a fresh scent.  I give it a thumbs up and so does my friend!</li>
            <li> fast service, good product, just as advertised, well satisfied.</li>
            <li> Came in fine, was packaged great.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have bought this perfume from here, and am not satified with the staying power.  Just not up to snuff.</li>
            <li> I have used this perfume for approx 30 yrs and plan on staying with it as long as it is available.  Lately I have been getting more compliments on it then ever before.  Finding it online for a cheaper price and the same quality, I will now use my online source instead of paying double at the local stores.  I love this perfume and have never been able to find another kind that I like better.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Oscar de la Renta cologne for many years.  I still get many compliments on how good I smell. It is a fresh, youthful aroma- not too heavy. This merchant offers this product at the best price I have seen.  Excellent.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using it for years!</li>
            <li> wonderful product, price and shipping.......could not be more pleased.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my wifes birthday she loves the way it smells its one of the best out there i think and would most defenitily purchase it again</li>
            <li> this product doesnt smell like the real perfume, it smells good but not the same as this perfume usually smells</li>
            <li> Item was just as it was stated in the for sale add.It was shipped &amp; arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Oscar de la Renta for 30 years.  Always get compliments on it.  Great price. Prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> I would rate Oscar de la Renta as a favorite of mine.  I&#x27;ve used it for many, many years and my husband does like it better than any other fragrance that I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;Shirley b</li>
            <li> This does not smell the same as the fragrance I love.  I decided to keep it but will not purchase from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> So happy to find my favorite perfume at a reasonable price!! Yay!!!</li>
            <li> I love this escencce..</li>
            <li> I was thoroughly happy with my order.  Oscar De La Renta has a wonderful smell and last a long time.  I receive a lot of compliments when I wear this spray.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Oscar since it was intro&#x27;d in the &#x27;70s. The bottle that arrived today is exactly like all the others I&#x27;ve had. It smells wonderful. :-) My only complaint, if you want to call it that, is that it took exactly 2 weeks from the date I ordered it for it to arrive. I&#x27;ll give amazon the benefit of the doubt, considering the blizzard conditions on the east coast. The package was shipped from KY.</li>
            <li> This is a scent you can wear daytime and evening.  It is not overpowering and makes you feel special.  I have used Oscar for about 20 years and still love it!</li>
            <li> I have used this since 1975, and the price is far better than any department store. If I am not wearing this scent, I fell like part of my identity is missing!</li>
            <li> We expected the perfume as per the diagram mentioned for the product.&lt;br /&gt;Name of the product and diagram are not matching.&lt;br /&gt;We are very disappointed with it.[[ASIN:B000C1ZA0C Oscar by Oscar De La Renta for Women - 3.3 Ounce EDT Spray]]</li>
            <li> Favorite scent. Like flowers</li>
            <li> Good price; arrived in time for Christmas. My mom loves it!</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and was exactly as advertised.  It took a while to find it while searching the web but I was glad when I did.  I would use this vendor again.</li>
            <li> Items purchased were very well accepted by the persons receiving them.  Thank You.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend gave me a set of this perfume over a year ago.  I loved it and when it was gone I wanted to purchase some more.  I was delighted to find that I could order it through Amazon.  The price was right and I loved having it shipped right to my home.</li>
            <li> I have been using \\&quot;Oscar\\&quot; for about 20years.  It has become my scent.  People stop me on the street and ask me what I&#x27;m wearing.  Everyone loves it. Amazon has the best price of anyone. Try it. You&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my Aunt who only wears Oscar. She received it promptly &amp; is enjoying the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 3/20/11: Just ordered two more bottles for my Aunt. Great product &amp; the price is still the BEST!</li>
            <li> This fragrance is not original. It&#x27;s a inmitacion. For the price you pay is not so bad. But I think Amazon should sell it as inmitacion and let the consumer know.</li>
            <li> This perfume is the best. I have been using it for years. It has the nicest softest sent that is not overpowering</li>
            <li> This is the only fragrance I use and it&#x27;s so expensive in the stores. I received this quickly and at half the price.</li>
            <li> Oscar De La Renta has always been my favorite. I paid half of what I pay in fine department stores. It arrived in 24 hours, now that&#x27;s fast.</li>
            <li> Same Oscar perfume I&#x27;ve been using for years. Its my signature fragrance.</li>
            <li> Oscar is still as good as ever</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift and it was very well received.  Thanks.  Everything came through the shipping process perfectly and the price was good.</li>
            <li> Got it for my mother for Mother&#x27;s Day. She loves it! Great price and fast shipping as always. Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice scent and great price for 3.3 ounces.  Can wear day or night.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> my favorite perfume at the best price</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN WEARING THIS FOR YEARS!  Light, delicious, perfect for spring and summertime.  The fragrance is just so nice!!  I request it every Mother&#x27;s Day and buy it for myself if I don&#x27;t receive it as a gift.</li>
            <li> Love my Oscar.  Always find the best price for it on Amazon. I&#x27;ve been using this fragrance for over 20 years now.</li>
            <li> my mother loves this and when i found it for a good price i could not resist . thank you</li>
            <li> Perfume is purfume.  It is all about the price.  And no, my wife is not intersted in the perfectly fine generic version of Oscar.  So when it is time to restock, it is a price hunt.  Stores...$60 to $85.  Amazon option $46 and no shipping [prime customer].  It is a no brainer.</li>
            <li> Been wearing this same perfume since college and still love it.</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom, because the one she had finish, she loves this, it smell good</li>
            <li> Great! Product as described. Thank you</li>
            <li> Love the way this product smells on my wife.</li>
            <li> You gotta love Amazon!  $35 for this is half of what it would be in a store!  Great gift for my aunt!</li>
            <li> Received exactly as advertised.  I purchased it from amazon not some other seller and it is exactly like the bottle that I usually buy from the local Walgreen&#x27;s but for a fraction of the price.  I don&#x27;t know what people where complaining about it is the full strength version not some water down one or an imitation, and thankfully not the blue one!  I purchased this as a gift for my moms birthday, she has been wearing it for decades.  Trust me she would know if something was off with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  a great product with a great fragrance. People always ask what I&#x27;m wearing. And Amazon always has the best prices and fastest shipping.</li>
            <li> Too strong for me!  I offered to return it, but they said no!  So, I gave it away!  No more of this stuff for me!</li>
            <li> I bought two of the Oscar de La Renta perfume for women and the perfume&#x27;s fragrance is not the Oscar de la Renta fragrance.  I should know I have used this perfume for many many years.  The perfume practically has no fragrance and to make things worse when I tried to return it I get a promt that it cannot be returned because it&#x27;s classified as containing dangerous materials (the perfume being the dangerous materials)  How was Amazaon able to ship it to me but I can&#x27;t ship it back?  Very frustrated!</li>
            <li> Oscar by Oscar De La Renta for Women has been my wife&#x27;s favorite for more than 20 years, and I like the scent as very pleasant spice like scent but not overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never is this long standing favorite on sale at local department stores, so Amazon.com&#x27;s price is nearly TWO bottles, for the price of ONE at most local department store prices, with free shipping &amp; no tax I buy them in pairs, one for a birthday gift &amp; one for a Christmas gift.  Convenient &amp; practical shopping with a few clicks of the mouse &amp; no need to drive which is another cost savings with nearly $4 per gallon gas prices.</li>
            <li> I have been using Oscar De La Renta for many years now. It became my signature scent. It is classy and not too strong.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this and has used it for the past 15 years. It has a great fragrance. I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, have used it many years and always get compliments on the sent.  .  I had been out of it for a while and found it here for a good price so ordered it for myself for Christmas!  Shipping and delivery was very fast, as always.  I am very happy with Amazon.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is not new to me. My wife fell in love with this fragrance and I have been buying it for her for 20+ years. The price I found on Amazon is the lowest price I have ever found it for and is the sole reason for my purchase (even though she doesn&#x27;t need it). One Christmas present in the bag!</li>
            <li> OSCAR IS THE ONLY PERFUME MY MOTHER-IN-LAW WILL USE AND AMAZON HAS THE BEST PRICE.  ALSO, ALMOST EVERYONE IN OUR FAMILY LIKES OSCAR.</li>
            <li> My sister is very happy.</li>
            <li> I love Oscar De La Renta.  I hope I can find this size  for the low price I paid in the future!  Thank You!</li>
            <li> I have been using this fragrance for over 30 years.  Hence, I know what the true fragrance is or should be.  I don&#x27;t know if the product you sent me has been sitting in a warehouse or something for a long  time because the fragrance of the bottle you sent me isn&#x27;t even close to the true fragrance.  I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money, price was very good, product is the real &#x27;thing&#x27;.  Would recommend product and distributor as a source for similar.</li>
            <li> This is an old standby fragrance that I have used for years, but the price at Amazon was truly amazing!</li>
            <li> There are only two scents that I absolutely love and this is one of them.  I like that it is soft and floral.  I receive many compliments when I wear this scent. The price is right as well, so it&#x27;s a win-win.</li>
            <li> Product delivered as described, shipping on time</li>
            <li> So disappointed as I opened this bottle of a cologne I order regularly from you  ......  too late to attempt to send it back, ..have&lt;br /&gt;used it and tried Several sprayings, .... with very few results !  and a waste of time and whatever was in the bottle  that disincluded&lt;br /&gt;the REAL  deal !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will not be ordering this again, ..so familiar with OSCAR and have used it for many years, ...and the times purchased from&lt;br /&gt;Amazon have been satisfactory ........................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, I would not recommend this &#x27;version&#x27; you are carrying ......... to anyone.  I hope you all do look into this major flaw !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely, Jan Burris</li>
            <li> Great price, fast shipping. Better than any other store in the area. Five stores sell this and keep it locked up. Must be like gold.</li>
            <li> I love Oscar but it is so expensive in the stores.  This one was a great price - delivered to my door and it is perfect!!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance.  It reminds me of Hawaii, being there the beautiful ocean, trees and everything.</li>
            <li> Every woman should wear this.  I have worn Oscar for 30 or so years and it is the only fragrance I use.  I do love it.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how big the bottle was. I had used this before. Just never got it because it was so expensive at stores.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Definitely not the real deal.  Fragrance does not last more than an hour!!  Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Fantastic. I loved this scent. I received the item a few days ahead of schedule, which was perfect as I had used the last of my previous bottle the morning.</li>
            <li> fragrance doesn&#x27;t last at all  the one I got from another store was much better</li>
            <li> Love it! Smells so good. Great gift</li>
            <li> what more needs to be said. It is  a classic.  I just wish the had a BODY LOTION!  BODY LOTION AND DUSTING POWDER!!!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell a difference in this and my purchases in the past 30 years......but this one was &amp;#34;made in the USA&amp;#34; instead of France.  It smells the same, looks the same......but from the first time I used it.....the cap fell apart.  Doesn&#x27;t effect the use of it......the spray works fine......just have to put the top together to put it back on.  Needless to say, I don&#x27;t bother.  In thirty years of buying this perfume from other sources......this has never happen.</li>
            <li> Item was as described. Prompt shipping. Thank you</li>
            <li> Out of the shipping box it was defective.  The sprayer did not work.  Amazon did credit me immediately, but I was still disappointed as this was a Mother&#x27;s day gift that will never get used. :-(</li>
            <li> I have used this product for some years and I am so happy that I can always find it on your website.  Thank You</li>
            <li> This is my favorite product and I have a hard time finding it in the big bottle---this is an amazing price and I am forever grateful that AMAZON carries it!  unbelievable...  and yes, it is the same cologne that I have been using and will continue to use.&lt;br /&gt;I love Amazon because the price is perfect, the  service is great and they have never made a mistake on my orders...  it is thebest thing going--no wonder the stock is the price it is...  they have it down!</li>
            <li> Great price- delivered as expected. would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> My favorite scent.  My husband bought this for me for my birthday.  I LOVE this.  It has a very light and fresh scent that is never overpowering.  For the woman who doesn&#x27;t need her perfume to arrive before she does!  Thank you, Baby! :)</li>
            <li> I rated this product high because my wife is so happy with it and I like the fragrance also. I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love Oscar De La Renta cologne.  The price is absolutely great compared to what this 3.3 oz. size costs at the store and other outlets.  The smell is so romantic.  I was so glad I found this on Amazon&#x27;s website.  Oscar has always been one of my favorite colognes.</li>
            <li> This Bottle does not quite smell like the previous bottle that I purchased from another site.  The color was also much lighter and the smell seems to have a higher alcohol smell.  It smell also doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as the last bottle either!</li>
            <li> I was so excited about being able to order the perfume I use Oscar as it is hard to find it in stores here.  It was easy to do, received quickly and at a competitive price.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;Mikall Norris</li>
            <li> Love it!! This is my favorite perfume and I have found somewhere I don&#x27;t have to outragious prices for once</li>
            <li> Oscar De La Renta is my favorite perfume.  I like it cause it&#x27;s not overwhelming when I put it and it lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s for my 92 year old grandmother and hard to find. Since she loves its, I&#x27;m happy to be able to get it for her.</li>
            <li> I received the order quickly and safely.</li>
            <li> what can i say classic never die</li>
            <li> Great value for the money!</li>
            <li> My Wife loves this&lt;br /&gt;Good price and quick shipping.</li>

            <li> Oscar by Oscar de la Renta for Women is a fabulous scent.  Amazon had the best price for this product.  The shipping was fast, the ordering process easy and quick.  Will purchase this product again from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Best ever. This is my comfort scent.  I feel great when wearing.</li>
            <li> I have worn this perfume for over 25 years. Loved it then and love it still. I receive so many compliments when having this fragrance on. Mostly from strangers as my family and loved ones think this is just how I smell! :-)</li>

            <li> I love Oscar it makes me feel extra special when I get dressed up and go out. It&#x27;s soft sensual and sexy all at the same time.  It also has a clean fresh sent.  Well worth the purchase.  Looking at the packaging it&#x27;s simple and delicate I actually thought it would be a very lite sent whch wouldn&#x27;t last long, it actually last all day no re-spraying.</li>
            <li> Wear this and nothing else.  Not overpowering. You do not leave a trail behind you. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> My Oscar came perfectly packaged in its own box as shown. It also arrived earlier than expected. Definitely will be ordering this product again soon.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Mariann</li>
            <li> A light and wonderful scent that lasts. Have been a fan of De LA Renta and all his products for many, many years</li>
            <li> The product arrived as scheduled and was the same as my wife buys at the Department store for double the price I paid.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume and I have worn it for years. Yes i would recommend it. Many people complement me on it.</li>
            <li> Love this scent!  Very soft not strong at all.  Whenever I wear it I get many compliments. Recently I gave it as a gift to my sister who had never tried it and now she&#x27;s &amp;#34;hooked&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> GOOD SERVICE AT A GOOD PRICE.....</li>
            <li> This Item was what I wanted. It came when I expected it and everything was terrific. I would use this site again whenever I might need to.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Fully packaged but smells old, the alcohol  content very pronounced.</li>
            <li> like &amp; have been using for many years.  Need to reorder.</li>
            <li> Was very pleased w/the product &amp; the time of arrival. I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Product is OLD and does NOT have scent of OSCAR!</li>
            <li> This cologne is an old standard.  It&#x27;s great for all occasions.  The scent is subtle and not overpowering.  I get compliments about it regularly from both men and women.</li>
            <li> The perfume arrived promptly and was as described.</li>
            <li> This was definitely not Oscar.  Packaging looked authentic, however when compared with authentic Oscar that I still had,  the scent was not the Oscar I have used for years.  My opinion, definitely a knock-off.</li>
            <li> My signature fragrance.  Hubby loves it!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom - it is her favorite perfume. Best price around by far.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister.&lt;br /&gt;It is her favorite fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;So it will most likely be much appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27; given it to her yet…</li>
            <li> Oscar De La Renta for Women never disappoints. It never fails that someone will ask &#x27;What are you wearing&#x27;?. That&#x27;s a sure sign that you are wearing the perfect perfume. It never goes unnoticed followed by a lovely compliment..</li>
            <li> ordered it for my Daughter for her birthday, I am sure it will be pleasing to her, it  arrived  as promised. I will give it to her on the week end</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. I have been using it for over over 20 yrs and still get complements on the fragrance.</li>
            <li> one of my long time favorites</li>
            <li> The perfume I ordered was for my wife. It is one she used to wear a long time ago before we got together. She mentioned wanting to try it again, but didn&#x27;t know how much it would cost. My wife said she paid around $80 for the same size bottle back in the late 80&#x27;s. Now it is only half that. It is a very nice fragrance. Very large bottle for a cheap price. The perfume was sealed from the manufacturer. The cap came apart, but it just needed to be glued back together. All in all, well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I started buying this fragrance for my wife about thirty years ago. This is the only one that she wears. She absolutely loves it and that makes me happy.</li>
            <li> This Oscar de la Renta perfume is a fake.  I have used Oscar for many years.  This fragrance does not last an hour, not even a hint of it.  Doesn&#x27;t smell the same either.  Conveniently, *sarcasm* it is not returnable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amendment:  I contacted Amazon about this perfume and I was issued a full refund.  WOW.</li>
            <li> Soft , gentle, lovely&lt;br /&gt;The one perfume I know for FACT an Asmatic can wear&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP&lt;br /&gt;After 15 seconds of use,&lt;br /&gt;If you can smell it yourself,  you have &amp;#34;TOO  MUCH on&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is my scent!  I always receive compliments on it!  It is both my everyday and special occasion perfume!  This price is the best.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Very efficient care of delivery and valuable price!!!</li>
            <li> Light and beautiful scent.</li>
            <li> Oscar De La Renta is my favorite fragrance for many, many years.  Have tried other fragrances but  OSCAR DE LA RENTA is the BEST!</li>
            <li> Perfume was a Christmas gift for my wife and she was extremely happy with the gift. I have to remember it for next year.</li>
            <li> My husband found it on Amazon.com and spent less money than purchasing at the dept. store.  I use it sparingly because it has been so expensive.  I&#x27;ve tried other scents, but my body chemistry changes the frangrance to stink. Oscar seems to have the only stable frangrance for me and I LOVE IT !</li>
            <li> This perfume is still the classic essence of Oscar De La Renta.  It allures and captures the attention of all.</li>
            <li> my wife wears only oscar de la renta very very happy</li>
            <li> I have loved this scent since it came out. Still do.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe this is the real Oscar, as the scent does not last at all!</li>
            <li> I have always loved this parfum and was thrilled to find it on Amazon - Thank you :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS and have been wearing it almost exclusively for many years.  Great scent, not too strong, lasts without being overpowering. Wonderful!!  &amp;#34;Anyone&amp;#34; should be able to wear this, for any occasion.</li>
            <li> I purchase this fragrance for my sister every year for Christmas, she always smells amazing. I&#x27;m sad it&#x27;s so pricey though.</li>
            <li> Better price than is available anywhere else for this size. Love this perfume. Has been my signature scent for 20 years. It has a soft floral scent with hints of rose. Not overpowering. My only complaint is that the bottle can not be opened and decanted into another perfume bottle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear anything else as a perfume.  I have been given others over the years, but always go back to this scent.  It&#x27;s my signature smell and my children wouldn&#x27;t know me without this herbal, floral, non overwhelming perfume.</li>
            <li> I have used this fragrance for over 40 years and receive more compliments then any other fragrance I have worn.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this perfume for over 30 years and is definitely not the original essence, has trouble fixing and evaporates very fast unlike the original.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful perfume.  I used it a few years ago and loved it but I was about to run out of it.  Was so pleased to find it.  You won&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this cologne for many years, but this bottle made me break out.</li>
            <li> MY WIFE, INEZ USES THIS PRODUCT AND HAS FOR MANY YEARS. IT&#x27;S ONE OF HER TWO FAVORITES. TOM</li>
            <li> Love my Oscar!  I have used this product for years and it is the only perfume I purchase.  It stays a nice soft scent, never overpowering - I get lots of compliments!</li>
            <li> A perennial favorite, never fails to please.  My favorite fragrance, shared with my Mother for many years.  Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I have always worn Oscar De La Renta and will always continue to do so.  Now that I know I can purchase this online without leaving the house to order is a plus and the price is more than fair!</li>
            <li> My favorite and quite expensive it you purchase this in a department store or beauty store.  Scent is light and wonderful.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast. Original product and box.</li>
            <li> Excellent vaue and quality.</li>
            <li> Got me smelling good again and within my budget. Didn&#x27;t have to wait to have someone purchase it for me as a gift.</li>
            <li> Came on time, well packaged, timely, the product was exactly as described online. Great service. would order again if needed.</li>
            <li> Stinks like what one might refer to as old ladies perfume!  Sorry :(</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume (I love smelling it on her).  The price was great, arrived as promised.</li>
            <li> She has used this perfume before and liked it.  She was thrilled to have it again.  The 3.3 oz. bottle will last for more than a year.</li>
            <li> I purchased this identical product from Amazon several months ago and still had some left when my new purchase arrived.  I opened the new spray and sprayed it on one wrist and noticed that it had a somewhat unpleasant smell.  I sprayed my old product on my other wrist and it definitely had the pleasant smell that I associate with Oscar and have worn for years.  I suspect this new product to be a knock-off.  Very disappointed.  The price on Amazon was well below several other sites so I guess I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is nice, but I think it is a knock off.  It does not smell exactly like Oscar and the fragrance does not last as long.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance. Slight powdery floral.</li>
            <li> Fantastic seller highly recommend A++++</li>
            <li> GREAT fragrance and price.  MY signature perfume..what can I say it&#x27;s the best smell in the world.</li>
            <li> My favorite! Great price and packed really well!</li>
            <li> Short and simple. This is my fianc&amp;eacute;&#x27;s personal choice. She loved the gift and rewarded me so well that it was almost like buying myself a gift.</li>
            <li> I very much liked this product it is my signature scent, received package in a timely manner in great condition, I would recommend this highly if you like a light clean scent.</li>
            <li> It has been somewhat difficult to find on occasion. Bought for my wife for Christmas. Good stuff. Amazon has a good price</li>
            <li> Received a couple days before specified.  Product was as expected.  My wife was very happy!  Will look to order more in the future as its my wife fave.</li>
            <li> Frankly I don&#x27;t use Cologne. However this is my wife favorite and it is so easy to buy through Amazon. We are both in our 80s.</li>
            <li> Exactly as I remembered it!</li>
            <li> Love Oscar. Looks just like old bottle with updated appliqu&amp;eacute;s. Old has Made in France, new says Made in USA!&lt;br /&gt;Arrived as stated and all is great!</li>
            <li> Thanks, item was as advertised!  It is being enjoyed as I write this review.</li>
            <li> I was a smoker but could not stand sitting in the smoking section on the plane. Their always were empty seats in the business section on the plane so I would go and sit in one of the empty seats to have a smoke. On this particular flight I was going to Switzerland and was joined by a woman who was on her way to Paris France for a one man show with a dozen painting she was bringing with her. While we were talking the stewardess was making her rounds selling duty free items. I was about to order Jean Patoe a very expensive perfume. The woman who I was in conversation said buy Oscar de pantry it is much better. Since she was a very suffocated individual I took her advice. My wife loved it and I also loved it. I remarried again when I lost my late wife. My new wife loves it and some friends that picked up the scent on her and they bought it also.</li>
            <li> My mom loves this stuff and she says it&#x27;s harder to find now, so getting here was great.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom. She has worn this scent since I was a baby. It&#x27;s her signature &amp;#34;mom scent&amp;#34;. I was a little skeptical since some of the reviews stated that this wasn&#x27;t the real deal. But it totally is and we were not disappointed at all! Since my mom has been wearing this scent for 30 years, she would have felt the difference instantly. It&#x27;s not easy to get this particular scent, unless you&#x27;re willing to pay some ridiculous price at places like Macy&#x27;s so I was very happy to find that this was the real deal for a great price!</li>
            <li> Was concerned that product was perhaps out of date? Just did not have full body aroma that used to! Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have 1980 used this since at least.  It&#x27;s a wonderful fragrance and always get compliments.  Just never want to be without it and believe me I&#x27;ve had close calls.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it and I am a hero</li>
            <li> My wife has been getting Oscar from Amazon for a few years and has been very pleased with the product till this time.  She ordered 2 bottles this time and the first one that she opened seems very weak - the scent.  She still had some of her old one so she was able to compare the two.  Have you changed your supplier?  Why the difference?  We would be very interested in hearing from you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> My moms all time favorite, ever since she went overseas, her friends started asking her to get them one too</li>
            <li> Worn Oscar for twenty years it last and stands out as a nice fragrance</li>
            <li> This has been my signature fragrance for so long that I can&#x27;t remember when I didn&#x27;t use it. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this perfume for years and will continue to purchase it. I would recommend it to anyone. It&#x27;s not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I ordered Oscar De La Renta because I&#x27;ve used it for a few years and enjoy the fragrance. It was delivered on time and the product was as expected.</li>
            <li> The price was perfect, the oscar can&#x27;t be beat.  I&#x27;ve worn oscar for 20 years or more.  It&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> I dearly love this fragrance.  But, since I cannot get my wife to wear it, I spray a little of it on my pillow at night.  Does this make me strange?  Hope not, but do hope the manufacturer will make a man&#x27;s cologne of the same fragrance.</li>
            <li> Just a wonderful fragrance for daytime or evening.  Have used it for years &amp; never grown tired of it:  Not overly sweet, nor too musky.</li>
            <li> Gave this along with dusting powder to my mom for christmas.  It is her favorite scent and this offer was a very reasonable price.  Quick delivery too</li>
            <li> I have worn Oscar for years and still love it.  Great in the summer since it has a light fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume!  I have worn this for years! I always get compliments!  This fragrance last all day and even while serving food and drinks all day!</li>
            <li> I ordered the wrong fragrance, I gave it away to my sister as a gift. I personally didn&#x27;t like the scent.</li>
            <li> I will wear this fragrance til they quit making it. It is very soft and fragrant, but never overbearing. I have worn OSCAR for years, and still love it. I have tried other fragrances, but have not found any to equal the softness, and delight of OSCAR. Thank you, your service was fantastic, very pleased</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance.  It&#x27;s a light floral and not overpowering.  This is the only perfume I wear and it never fails to bring compliments.</li>
            <li> She really like this, and it&#x27;s authentic so this will last quite some time and she doesn&#x27;t use much.  Doesn&#x27;t want to be one of those who &amp;#34;bathe in their perfume.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Excelent !!! I BUYED AT BLACK FRIDAY AT EXCELENT PRICE. ORIGNAL PERFUM.</li>
            <li> I rarely wear a different fragrance.  This one is me.</li>
            <li> This item arrived intact and on time</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom because it&#x27;s her favorite perfume, she really likes it. Was sketched about all of the counterfeit fragrances online but this turned out to be legit. Was worth the gamble, thanks.</li>
            <li> Have used this perfume for years. My husband is in love with it also and comments every time I wear it. Much too expensive in the department stores. Price and delivery service are very important with me and Amazon is the only place I buy my Oscar.</li>
            <li> Both Krizia and Oscar are very nice fragrances. They are not over powering and were a great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a problem with Oscar from Amazon. I&#x27;ve worn it for 30+ years and think I&#x27;d notice a scent change. Best deal on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;9/2/15. I&#x27;ve got to go with several others who have brought up the issue of the scent being off with the current Oscar being sent. I have just opened a bottle that I bought from Amazon a couple of months ago and it&#x27;s not right. Very alcohol smelling and weak. And I promise, I know the smell of Oscar. And I guess I&#x27;ll be returning it. Is it possible that &amp;#34;seconds&amp;#34; are being distributed to Amazon?</li>
            <li> For me this is the perfect way to begin and end a day, pampered with the unforgetable scent of Oscar.</li>
            <li> Great price, product, and extremely fast delivery.</li>
            <li> my wife smells really sexy with this</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite perfume. The scent is so different, and I have had so many compliments from passersby when wearing it. It is not an overbearing aroma, but rather subtle and pleasant.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s favorite cologne and I buy it for her every Christmas.  She has worn it for years and years!!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.  I have used it for years and would not change!!  Great smell.</li>
            <li> Wife loves this fragrance, and it is always a favorite. With quick shipping and purchase at a great price, it was a real hit.</li>
            <li> Oscar De La Renta, what more could I say. Scent is very flattering. I would buy this perfume again. Nice.</li>
            <li> as, always. it&#x60;s GREAT! bought 3 for family [ladies]</li>
            <li> Oscar De La Renta is a beautiful fragrance that I have loved since my childhood. I was very excited to see it available through Amazon at such a great price. I will enjoy it, and know that I can buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have been in love with this scent for over 30 years, matter of fact it is the only fragrance I use.  The spray bottle saves in longer lasting value.  The price with amazon is the best you can get.  It was packaged correctly and you can buy it for a gift or yourself.  I do both mostly during Christmas gifts.  Hope you enjoy it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> Oscar is my wife&#x27;s favorite.  She couldn&#x27;t wait until Christmas as her current Oscar spray was about to run out.</li>
            <li> I always get this on Amazon because the price if right and delivery is fast.  Keep up the good work.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne and wear it just about every day.  I am always getting complements about it smell and would recommend this item to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great price!! Arrived on time. No problems and much cheaper than anywhere else.</li>
            <li> The best perfume on the planet, IMO.&lt;br /&gt;Great seller and product, a must have!!</li>
            <li> Great gift for my wife......</li>
            <li> Bought this product as a Christmas gift for someone who has been using it for many many years.  Authentic product, great price.</li>
            <li> I love this scent and most others love it too - I have used this for years and have always been very pleased! It got to us quickly and we would order again!!</li>
            <li> Oscar De La Renta is a very fragrant perfume, and I just love it.  Would recommend that other women buy it.  They&#x27;ll enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Always love it - have worn this fragrance since it&#x27;s inception.</li>
            <li> A timeless classic. Perfect as usual!</li>
            <li> I love oscar and you cant beat this price</li>
            <li> Arrived in good condition. I was worried since heat can affect fragrances, but it was fine, and the price was awesome!</li>
            <li> A little bit heavier perfume but I have used this sparingly for years, a &amp;#34; special :&amp;#34; occasion  scent. I love it, but it is not for everybody.It is a bit pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn Oscar De La Renta before and absolutely love the soft scent that lasts all day.  It&#x27;s the type of smell that happens as you walk away and people call out to you -&amp;#34;wow what are you wearing?!&amp;#34;  I would definitely recommend this fragrance and from this seller.</li>
            <li> This is the only fragrance I wear that I consistently get compliments on.  I go through 2 bottles a year.</li>
            <li> have used it for years</li>
            <li> I loved the price, but disappointed in what I received.  I am 82 yrs. young and have used Oscar for years.  I was so happy to see Oscar for the low price on Amazon.  When I received my order, I was excited to open it and refresh my memories of the wonderful fragrance once more.  Boy! was I disappointed.  I could not even smell the fragrance even after I sprayed my arm until it was soaked.  Still no fragrance.  I hate to be an accuser, but I feel that I have been ripped off by a take off on Oscar.  No wonder it&#x27;s so cheap on your site.  You can call me a very disappointed old lady and I am telling my friends about my experience.  Also noted, that my original Oscar&#x27;s top was sold black.  The one I received was silver in color.  I know about packaging changes over time, but the Oscar fragrance must have been watered down.  Sorry to say, I wasted my money on a rip off.&lt;br /&gt;Dorothy Smith</li>
