            <li>Love it and my feet are smooth.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and quick.  </li>

            <li>Love it works really good gets all the dead skin off</li>
            <li>It is made very well and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It removed all unwanted calluses and left my feet very smooth!</li>
            <li>so I could use it ASAP and the extra roller was nice.</li>
            <li>It does work well, though the product developers could have taken more time providing clear explanations per it&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li>I had been using an expensive foot file which though effective, was so much work in order to obtain a beautiful result.  </li>
            <li>It is lightweight, comfortable to hold and easily used by right or left handers.</li>
            <li>Works quickly and gently.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable as well.</li>
            <li>It comes with an extra roller which is great and allows me to keep using this item for a long time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are three extra rollers of varying roughness, I love that.</li>
            <li>, this makes it fun and works so fast.</li>
            <li>My feet look amazingly soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Fast ship!</li>
            <li>It was pretty straight forward though which says a lot for the product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It runs on batteries so I can use it outside easily.</li>
            <li>I have used this on corns on my little toes and I am very happy to whittle them down and stop the pain!  </li>
            <li>This electronic pedicure tool really took care of my feet.</li>
            <li>I have a confession to make, I use my Dremel tool to sand the bottoms of my heels to get them ready for summer.</li>
            <li>The biggest problem I found is that it doesn&#x27;t have as much power as my stronger Dremel tool.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used it straight out of the box without any instructions.</li>
            <li>works really well</li>
            <li>works very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very please with my purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is far better than a different one I purchased.</li>
            <li>This electronic pedicure callus remover works much better due to the wider sanding bar.</li>
            <li>For others willing to buy this, just make sure you change the batteries; the ones who came with the product were dead.</li>
            <li>The design could be improved slightly by exposing more of the sanding roller--</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is quick and easy to use, removing the dead skin and the small callus with more ease than my Dremel.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly rcommend it.</li>
            <li>If you use it inside, be kind to your other housemates and vacuum the floor!</li>
            <li>It was fast and completely painless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but know I will need new rollers for it just need to know where to get them</li>
            <li>The only reasons I did not give this five stars is because it does not appear extra rollers are available at this time.</li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE this little darling!  </li>
            <li>My reason for giving only 3 stars is that the small booklet of instructions should be much more thorough, such as which color roller to use for which result, recommendations on how often to use it safely, the cleaning of the product suggests seeing particular numbered illustrations; none of which are included in the booklet and I am not even certain what is being advised due to the wording used.  </li>
            <li>Great safe way to get rid of dead skin on feet without cutting.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try the Kinbar electronic callus remover which truly gave me such a lovely result in so little time.</li>
            <li>It took so much work using a standard file, so I decided to buy this electric file.</li>
            <li>I was first worried that this would be too rough but</li>
            <li>It is small enough to easily pack in with my clothes.</li>
            <li>I can now file my rough feet down to smooth in no time.</li>
            <li>If you have really tough and hard feet, this will work great for you.</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t take my word for it, use this little gadget inside and watch the skin flakes dust all over the floor revealing ultra soft skin underneath!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (Be careful with clothing or jewelry such as ankle bracelets when using any rotary tool on the off chance it could be caught.</li>
            <li> I have had trouble with callus on my feet for years and used the old filing system</li>
            <li> So we will see how long it holds up.</li>
            <li> Definitely a home pedicure without cost of going out and getting one and can now use daily!!!I have been wearing a brace when go out for 4 years now and feet get so dry and rough</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend the extra on the other brand.  </li>
            <li> I have been suffering with severe dry, cracked heels for years.</li>
            <li> I even tried it on the palms my hands which tend to dry in Winter</li>
            <li> Works very well on my feet and love how it comes with extra files but the battery life is terrible.</li>
            <li> My feet got terribly rough and dry.</li>
            <li> This does the job of eliminating calluses and rough skin.  </li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> but when they call it electronic I expected it to be electric and not battery powered.</li>
            <li> ) Looks as expected and works as promised.</li>
            <li> Hairy is relatively easy to deal with, but cracked, fissured heels are impossible to manage...</li>
            <li> it does everything it says its going to wear to get 5 stars other than the fact the amount of batteries you go through</li>
            <li> Was not worth the money</li>
            <li> I am also disappointed that there are no replacement rollers available for purchase; I wish I had investigated this before purchasing.    </li>
            <li> Until I bought this little grinder that could.</li>
            <li> Any time you put a little pressure on it, it stops.  </li>
            <li> it does take a few passes over my skin to remove heavy callused skin layers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It removes hard calluses with ease.</li>
            <li> Does almost nothing to remove hard skin.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, it was really quite painful</li>
            <li> why sell somthing and the refills are not avalible if i new that would not have made purchase terrible</li>
            <li> Wrong review.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s weird.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s also weird.</li>
            <li> Was not impressed.</li>
            <li> I mean they were BAD.</li>
            <li> Also, don&#x27;t get stupid and use this as a hair styling tool or whatever silly idea</li>
            <li> It preformed as described, removed the ugly callus on my elbow and on my foot .</li>
            <li> My heels have always cracked and looked awful.</li>

            <li> Excellent quality and service.</li>
            <li> Purchased as gift..Very Happy with item!</li>
            <li> This electronic pedicure tool really took care of my feet. It removed all unwanted calluses and left my feet very smooth! It comes with an extra roller which is great and allows me to keep using this item for a long time. It&#x27;s very portable and great to use while travelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this item for foot care!</li>
            <li> omg!! this little gizmo works great!</li>
            <li> This does the job of eliminating calluses and rough skin.  It&#x27;s easy to use and quick.  The design could be improved slightly by exposing more of the sanding roller--it&#x27;s easy to end up with the plastic hood rather than the sanding roller against the skin.</li>
            <li> I have a confession to make, I use my Dremel tool to sand the bottoms of my heels to get them ready for summer. This electronic pedicure callus remover works much better due to the wider sanding bar. The biggest problem I found is that it doesn&#x27;t have as much power as my stronger Dremel tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is quick and easy to use, removing the dead skin and the small callus with more ease than my Dremel. I will be using this product from now on. It is lightweight, comfortable to hold and easily used by right or left handers. (I tried it with both hands.) it does take a few passes over my skin to remove heavy callused skin layers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It runs on batteries so I can use it outside easily. It can go with me on vacation without worrying about a power adapter. It is small enough to easily pack in with my clothes. Be warned, it chews through batteries!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit appears sturdy and safe. (Be careful with clothing or jewelry such as ankle bracelets when using any rotary tool on the off chance it could be caught. Also, don&#x27;t get stupid and use this as a hair styling tool or whatever silly idea you have.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is best used outside as it is sanding off skin flakes. You don&#x27;t want skin flakes all over the house. If you use it inside, be kind to your other housemates and vacuum the floor! Don&#x27;t take my word for it, use this little gadget inside and watch the skin flakes dust all over the floor revealing ultra soft skin underneath!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three extra rollers of varying roughness, I love that. The rollers are easily changed and it comes with a cleaning brush and a protective cover. I would purchase this unit again. It is far better than a different one I purchased.</li>
            <li> My heels have always cracked and looked awful. A $30 pedicure was the only solution. Until I bought this little grinder that could. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Works great for the price</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this little darling!  I will never use the manual foot files again.  Wish I had found it sooner!</li>
            <li> I have been suffering with severe dry, cracked heels for years. I mean they were BAD. my ex-husband used to say I had hairy, troll feet. Hairy is relatively easy to deal with, but cracked, fissured heels are impossible to manage...or so I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read an article in which a celebrity was gushing about the electronic foot file. I asked Santa for this for Christmas, but he did not deliver, so I bought it myself on Amazon. I used it once...ONCE; and it was incredible! It was fast and completely painless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My heels used to catch and snag on my comforter. It was gross. Now my heels, and the rest of my feet and toes, are so smooth. I LOVE this product. I want to get one for every woman I know. The only reasons I did not give this five stars is because it does not appear extra rollers are available at this time. That&#x27;s weird. Also, my file did not come with any instruction manual or product information. That&#x27;s also weird. It was pretty straight forward though which says a lot for the product. I used it straight out of the box without any instructions. I bought the Amopoe Pedi Perfect lotion. That is the one-two punch! I have made my whole family and best friend feel my feet. They obliged, begrudgingly. They were impressed nonetheless...or at least they feigned admiration. Buy this product and pray they begin to sell the roller replacements before I wear them out.</li>
            <li> Love it works really good gets all the dead skin off but know I will need new rollers for it just need to know where to get them</li>
            <li> I bought this for calluses that come on my feet in the summer from wearing sandals all the time. It arrived in a timely manner and is well packaged.&lt;br /&gt;It works really well and I would recommend it to anyone and actually have and my daughter and daughter-in-law both tried it and are getting one.</li>
            <li> This tool actually works the way it was advertised.  It&#x27;s fast, easy and effective.  I have used this on corns on my little toes and I am very happy to whittle them down and stop the pain!  The price is great too!</li>
            <li> why sell somthing and the refills are not avalible if i new that would not have made purchase terrible</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these for my wife and decided it would also make a  great gift for my sister so I just purchased another when I saw it listed on Amazon. It is a great design. It looks like a razor, but has a rotating roller that sands away your calluses. It is a painless process and easier than using the manual board you may be used to. It is constructed well. Great bonus is that is comes with batteries so you can use it right out of the box with no worries. If you have really tough and hard feet, this will work great for you. It also comes with an extra roller so this should last a long time. The price is very reasonable as well.</li>
            <li> Works well but have not been able to find replacement rollers. May have to order another brand that had replacement rollers available</li>
            <li> works very well. what good is it if you can&#x27;t get replacements!</li>
            <li> My wife loves it. Works as expected.</li>
            <li> Works very well on my feet and love how it comes with extra files but the battery life is terrible. What you spend on batteries you could probably save and buy a rechargeable model.</li>
            <li> Love it and my feet are smooth. For others willing to buy this, just make sure you change the batteries; the ones who came with the product were dead.</li>
            <li> What a great relief for calluses and leaves feet feeling really smooth. Definitely a home pedicure without cost of going out and getting one and can now use daily!!!I have been wearing a brace when go out for 4 years now and feet get so dry and rough this is just perfect. Would make an awesome gift idea as well, I know many in my family that would love!!</li>
            <li> I love this product  I have had trouble with callus on my feet for years and used the old filing system, this makes it fun and works so fast.</li>
            <li> I like this. It works well. I wish the batteries lasted longer.</li>
            <li> My feet got terribly rough and dry. It took so much work using a standard file, so I decided to buy this electric file. I&#x27;m very please with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;  I was first worried that this would be too rough but its not. I can now file my rough feet down to smooth in no time. It is easy to use and comfortable to hold. It is made very well and easy to clean. I love that batteries came with it so I could use it ASAP and the extra roller was nice. I will be purchasing again as a gift for my mom.</li>
            <li> This works beautifully.  The price is great... 3 types  of exfoliating rollers! Try it you will be glad you did.  It removes hard calluses with ease. My feet look amazingly soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Excellent for the price. I didn&#x27;t want to spend the extra on the other brand.  Works great.</li>
            <li> Loved it. Had to buy more as gifts. Does tend to go through batteries quicker than I thought it should.</li>
            <li> Great product! It preformed as described, removed the ugly callus on my elbow and on my foot . I am very satisfied.  Do not hesitate in buying one for yourself.</li>
            <li> Works great with a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this item from a friend who received theirs, so i ordered one for my mom for her birthday and my mom loved using my friends wife&#x27;s foot smoother tool. It would be great if she would receive the one i bought, still waiting</li>
            <li> Was not impressed. Any time you put a little pressure on it, it stops.  Does almost nothing to remove hard skin. Was not worth the money</li>
            <li> I like it but when they call it electronic I expected it to be electric and not battery powered. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars</li>
            <li> This works great. Price is on point with others. However, it eats through batteries, and has plastic gears. So we will see how long it holds up. As well as how many batteries it goes through in a years.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Works perfect! Received it on time!</li>
            <li> Great product love it no problems</li>
            <li> I just used the Kinbar Electronic Pedicure File on my feet and hands.  So simple, works great-I am truly please with the way it works&lt;br /&gt;and that it is portable-no cord.  The price was great also good.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, leaves my feet beauuutiful : ) Looks as expected and works as promised.</li>
            <li> Definitely softens your feet.</li>
            <li> I was optimistic when I receivedy Kinbar. After years of callouse build up on my heels I decided to find a good product to help. The Kinbar lasted 3 times. I tried replacing batteries</li>
            <li> Fast ship! Excellent product! Item works well. My wife loves it.</li>
            <li> My feet haven&#x27;t looked this good in years.</li>
            <li> This is the best callus filing device I&#x27;ve ever used.  Works quickly and gently.</li>
            <li> I had been using an expensive foot file which though effective, was so much work in order to obtain a beautiful result.  I decided to try the Kinbar electronic callus remover which truly gave me such a lovely result in so little time. I even tried it on the palms my hands which tend to dry in Winter and it worked beautifully with no discomfort.  A word of caution however; while using it on the balls of my feet, the rotating file caught a fold of tender skin under one of my smaller toes which became trapped within the unit, so much as to stop the file from rotating. Needless to say, it was really quite painful and I will be definitely be guarding this area of my toes in the future.    My reason for giving only 3 stars is that the small booklet of instructions should be much more thorough, such as which color roller to use for which result, recommendations on how often to use it safely, the cleaning of the product suggests seeing particular numbered illustrations; none of which are included in the booklet and I am not even certain what is being advised due to the wording used.  I am also disappointed that there are no replacement rollers available for purchase; I wish I had investigated this before purchasing.    It does work well, though the product developers could have taken more time providing clear explanations per it&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> I wanted this to work and it does, in a way... it smoothes the feet for the day and the next morning you have to start over. And Im not running marathons to be honest.&lt;br /&gt;not the best</li>
            <li> it does everything it says its going to wear to get 5 stars other than the fact the amount of batteries you go through</li>
            <li> Great product, don&#x27;t spend more money on the more expensive ones, this one works perfectly and costs a lot less!</li>
            <li> Great safe way to get rid of dead skin on feet without cutting.  I highly rcommend it.</li>
