    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I am not going to say that this is the best sampler pack, but this was the best sampler pack for me.</li>
            <li>This is the best way to get into DE shaving.  </li>
            <li>Well because for me the best shave came from blades that where not platinum lubricated and where not known as the sharper blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This sampler pack fits the bill perfectly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d always just bought a pack of feathers because that&#x27;s what everyone said were the best.</li>
            <li>Well for me, they are not the best.</li>
            <li>These are excellent razor blades.</li>
            <li>some of the best blades from all over the world.</li>
            <li>They both have given the best and closest shaves.</li>
            <li>Great deal!</li>
            <li>The included Gillette, Shark, and Feather blades were the best for me.</li>
            <li>However there is truth that the best blade for me may not be your best blade so please take this review with a grain of salt and try them for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My boyfriend just got a safety razor and we were so unsure of which blade brand would work best.  </li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>me the Astras worked best for my head and the feathers worked best for my neck.  </li>
            <li>The Astra razors are the ones a like the best</li>
            <li>my face and the way I shave, the Astra is the perfect blade.</li>
            <li>It helped me determine which blade I like best with my razor.  </li>
            <li>This sampler is the best option I&#x27;ve seen yet to help with your decision.    </li>
            <li>These felt the best with the fewest nicks.</li>
            <li>so ,I know which blades works best for me.</li>
            <li>this was awesome for getting a feel for blade differences.</li>
            <li>the included 7 O&#x27;Clocks are an excellent match for me.  </li>
            <li>Doing a sampler pack is the best way to figure out which ones you like for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So this (shaving with double-edge safety blades), I believe, is the perfect system.</li>
            <li>(you get maybe three perfect shaves per blade) and</li>
            <li>Its great!</li>
            <li>While the mistake happened, and mistakes happen with anyone, I am seriously impressed with the customer service, and quality of care I received.</li>
            <li>Still trying to figure out which works best for me...</li>
            <li>Used this to find out that Durby and Astra are the rasers that work best with my face.  </li>
            <li>For example, I bought and excellent razor, but I did not like the blades it came with</li>
            <li>Shaving with those blades is the best experience and the best feel after shaving.</li>
            <li>This selection is very, very good.</li>
            <li>Still a very good razor.  </li>

            <li>This is a good sample pack I am still working on which ones I like the best.  </li>

            <li>Excited to see which blade I like for shaving best.</li>
            <li>Feathers were the best for me, but that doesn&#x27;t hold true for everyone.</li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s more cost effective, I didn&#x27;t want to buy 50-100 of 1 razor type until I found one that I liked best.</li>
            <li>After going through all of them I have found the one that best suits me, the Shark Super Chrome.</li>
            <li>If you are just getting into shaving like your grampa, this is an EXCELLENT way to sample different manufacturer&#x27;s DE Blades and find what works best for you.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve not tried all the individual blades yet, this is a very good way to determine which one will work best for your needs (skin, face,skill in use), etcetera!</li>

            <li>I have to commend them for recognizing the fact that there is a great difference in blade brands and for making this sampler available.</li>

            <li>I have not tried all the brands yet but those that I have, I liked, I have used the derby,astra and feather, I&#x27;ll try the others soon.</li>

            <li>I use these in a Merkur HD with Van Der Hagen Deluxe or</li>

            <li>Superior Platinum: 3</li>
            <li>Some of what I really liked, others seemed to dislike and</li>

            <li>These provided the absolute best shave in both comfort and closeness.</li>

            <li>Nice sample pack to get you started on your own DE razor addiction.</li>

            <li>Allowed me to determine which blades worked best with my new razor.</li>
            <li>Being relatively new to DS/wet shaving I needed a way to see which blade truly does work best for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good survey of available blades - some I liked and some</li>
            <li>Keep up the great work, and know that how you treat customers is sometimes more important than the product itself.</li>
            <li>great assortment, and quick ship.</li>
            <li>Be sure to use nice shaving cream/lotion like Shiseido.</li>
            <li>Thankfully I was able to find one that I liked.</li>
            <li>It has a selction of the more popular blades out there.</li>
            <li>of the brands in this sampler are good and gave me close, comfortable shaves.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You should buy a sampler kit, and among the ones available on Amazon, this is quite a good one.</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell, the Derby blades seem to be the best for my skin.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best idea for anyone getting into DE shaving.  </li>
            <li>These were far and away the best blades for me.  </li>
            <li>So far the Feathers work best for me</li>
            <li>And well worth the money to find a blade I&#x27;m happy with.</li>
            <li>I bought this to figure out what kind of blades I will like the most.</li>
            <li>So far I like the Derby blade the best.  </li>
            <li>I like shark the best so far.  </li>
            <li>Great start for anyone trying to find the right blade.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, the &amp;#34;duller&amp;#34; blades such as Astra and Derby give me the best shaves and feel nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>It gives you a nice start for testing out various blade options so you can see what works best for you.  </li>
            <li>Was nice to have multiple brands to find the one I like the best... which I did!</li>
            <li>The offering was pretty great.</li>
            <li>Great variety for a first timer.</li>
            <li>They seemed to be a good balance of between mild and aggressive.  </li>
            <li>that being said, this sampler pack helped me zero in on my favorite, which was the Feathers.</li>
            <li>Without having bought this sample set, I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to find my blades.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad the offer sample packs like this.  </li>
            <li>Out of the set, the Derby are the most forgiving, although I get razor bumps from them.  </li>
            <li>Safety razor blades are not a product where sharper means better.  </li>
            <li>The 7 o&#x27;clock blades were ok for my beard, however the rest were like shaving with a cheese grater.  </li>
            <li>After 30+ years of using twin (and more) blade disposables, I was getting too many ingrown whiskers.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did</li>
            <li>The [[ASIN:B004SGKMA0 Derbys]] are sure to remain in my arsenal.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;*for better results with glued blades, insert the blade with the glue spots facing the handle.&lt;br /&gt;PS.</li>
            <li>I would bet that any shaver will find his/her favorite brand by getting this sampler pack.</li>
            <li>but i am glad i got it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m much better off with an Astra, or Gillette blade.</li>
            <li>The best thing is that this pack will probably last me a year</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally the Astra and and the Feathers have been my favorite.</li>
            <li>plan on doing more testing to figure out which is my favorite,</li>
            <li>I should state I never use a blade for more than 3 shaves</li>
            <li>This sampler had most of the blades I wanted to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Best overall in terms of sharpness, durability, and effectiveness.</li>
            <li>Some work better than others based on my beard type and the razor.  </li>
            <li>The advice you get on many message boards is correct:  buy a sampler pack and try different blades to find what works best for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the feel of the Feather blade.  </li>
            <li>You have to try several and see which one works the best for you!  </li>
            <li>Amount of blades provided in each sample was appropriate for testing.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure if I had tried all of them</li>
            <li>/&gt;You&#x27;ll pay more though.</li>
            <li>Shark and Derby so-so, Gillette blades made in Russia better.</li>
            <li>Shark blades; for me these were the most uncortable.</li>
            <li>; I know many here love these</li>
            <li>I bought this sampler to find what blade I would find most</li>
            <li>Many choices and many prices.  </li>
            <li>My favorite was the Feather.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping for better from the Bluebird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The feather package comes with a safe disposal container.  </li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be purchasing this product again for myself, but I do plan on giving a safety razor set as a gift to a friend, and I&#x27;ll be sure to include this package.</li>
            <li>It provides some interesting variety.</li>
            <li>This was a great decision on my part before investing in a whole 100 pack of something I wouldn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried all of the blades yet, but some do a better job than others and that is why I wanted to purchase this.  </li>
            <li>Sharpest isn&#x27;t always better and brand quality may surprise you.</li>
            <li>After leaving sams club spending $100 on 28 gillette cartridges, I thought there has got to be a better way.  </li>
            <li>so he hasn&#x27;t decided on a favorite blade yet</li>
            <li>but it arrived within a week which was much better.</li>
            <li>and perhaps I&#x27;ll revisit them if I&#x27;m feeling adventurous</li>
            <li>; tried a couple, found one that feels better than the rest on MY FACE (the Astra) and bought a hundred of them...</li>
            <li>This is the best way to decide on which blade you&#x27;re going to use (a very personal choice).  </li>
            <li>That is OKAY.  </li>
            <li>More came than is listed in the listing.  </li>
            <li>More words.</li>
            <li>As with most people every result is quite different depending on the blade which works best for them.</li>
            <li>An excelent range of blades to help you find your favorite.</li>
            <li>The only way to find out which blades are best for you is to try them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I took the gamble and bought the Crystal Platinums and was glad I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been experimenting with each in turn, and once I settle on my favorite, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll buy from here on out.</li>
            <li>lots of blades,lots of choices,and inexpensive.what more could you want?</li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>so wasn&#x27;t sure which ones to purchase.  </li>
            <li>I will try one more blade, but if this happens again, I will discard these like I did with the Sharks.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li>I love the Astras.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give these another go, just to be sure, and update this review</li>
            <li>and I was looking mostly for the closest shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Conclusion: The last three blades are all magnificent.</li>
            <li>and I was looking mostly for the closest shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Conclusion: The last three blades are all magnificent.</li>
            <li>I am sure I will like some of the others though.</li>
            <li>I bought them because I&#x27;m trying out different blades in order to figure out which ones will work best for shaving my legs.  </li>
            <li>I found that Feathers, Sharks and Astra&#x27;s cut best through my coarse hair, with Astra&#x27;s leaving the smoothest shave.</li>
            <li>Very impressed with the Gillette Silver Blue and 7 o&#x27;clock based on their 50/100 count price online, may end up going with those.</li>
            <li>Started shaving with a safety razor about a year ago and this sample pack is an awesome way to get a feel for different blades.</li>
            <li>Cant beat the price either :-)</li>
            <li>All the lil boxes are cute and I cant wait to try them out.</li>
            <li>The Feather ones were my favorite though</li>
            <li>If you buy a razor definitely buy a variety pack to try out and find the perfect blade for your skin.</li>
            <li>and I love it:</li>
            <li>Picked this up to sample what was out there... and I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Good place to start to find the right blade.</li>
            <li>Someone suggested to me that I get a sampler (since I&#x27;m a first time safety razor user) to get a sense of what works best for my skin... and this certainly provided that assortment.</li>
            <li>Very Useful!</li>
            <li>Nice, selection of blades from the sharpest to the more mild.</li>
            <li>Gives me a chance to sample various blades, the Astra and Feather are very good, Derby is OK, the rest, although better than cartridge, are not keepers for me although I know people that like them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Astra - Tried these first based on forums and a friend&#x27;s recommendation as a good starter blade.  </li>
            <li>Good selection of what is considered the higher end DE blades.  </li>
            <li>Great way for a new DE user to try a variety of blades.</li>
            <li>Great purchase with new razor.</li>
            <li>This was a great sample starter kit for a new found hobby that I hope to master soon.</li>
            <li>Great priced sampler pack for the new safety razor user (me).  </li>
            <li>Everything was packed nice and was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>The best blades are cheap enough to use by anyone.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They are quite pricey for only 35 blades ($18.50 when I bought them) but a very good way to see what suits your needs and face..</li>
            <li>This sampler pack gives you an assortment of blades to try for a very good price, I&#x27;d highly recommend it to anyone looking to find the right safety razor blade for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>is that I can now shave with every blade comfortably, though some are markedly better than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Having 5 of each allows you to revisit those blades once you are more comfortable with the DE razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, I found that some of the blades were really rough on my face (the Gillette and Shark blades), others didn&#x27;t shave as closely (Astra and Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock) and the blade I like best is the Feather</li>
            <li>Great way to try out several different razor brands to find out what works best.</li>
            <li>This nice collection of blades should help you find the right blade for your type of shaving needs.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny! :)</li>
            <li>Great way to test blades more than once, and now my wife and I can try different blades for our DE shavers with out having to compromise on who gets what.</li>
            <li>If Feather (see below) is a 10/10 in closeness, these are easily a 9.5/10.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another good point about this particular sampler is the range of aggressiveness that you have here.</li>
            <li>Good variety of blades all of high quality.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This pack is great for people who are starting out with wet shaving, and who are trying to figure out what blade works best - which is something I&#x27;d recommend you do before you buy a pack of just one brand.</li>
            <li>I chose this one over other available sampler packs on Amazon because the brand of blades that are included in this one seemed to have the best reputation.  </li>
            <li>I wish that this pack included the Crystal Platinums, but this is still a good pack to start with as most likely you&#x27;ll find a favorite in here.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock - These blades worked pretty well with a nice close first shave and a perfectly acceptable 2nd shave.  </li>
            <li>Feather - Another very sharp blade that wasn&#x27;t the best for me.</li>
            <li>A good blade for someone new to shaving with a DE razor perhaps.  </li>
            <li>Sampler packs in general are ingenius tools at the wetshaver&#x27;s disposal, since the whole point is to find the best razor blade for your face/gear combination.</li>
            <li>Got everything I wanted in the same exact packaging as pictured, and the blades are great!</li>
            <li>Derby is considered by many as a rather mild blade.</li>
            <li>Very nice selection of the top blades on the market - essential for finding the one blade &#x27;Right&#x27; for you !</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve been enjoying the Feather, and Astra blades the most!</li>
            <li>Great for the new DE shavers looking for the right blade.</li>
            <li>Maybe good for light beards and/or sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>Great way to sample several brands.</li>
            <li>sampler is a great way to test drive a bunch of different blades.  </li>
            <li>B00875XSIQ Gillette Stainless]] didn&#x27;t seem to be as nice as the Platinums.  </li>
            <li>The Derby&#x27;s are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Great way to try different brands.</li>
            <li>Great way to sample different brands before buying in bulk.</li>
            <li>I have a feeling that in the end I will end up using the Astra blades as they are cheap</li>
            <li>Completely comfortable.  </li>
            <li>but all of them, with the safety razor as a whole, have provided a much more enjoyable, comfortable shaving experience.  </li>
            <li>But I am *really* happy with the Silver Blue and the Feathers.</li>
            <li>Great collection to get started and explore different blades.</li>
            <li>I have read elsewhere that Feathers are the sharpest blades available.</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought this variety pack, but I suppose that I am not as sensitive as others, I really cannot find a great deal of difference between the Bluebird, Astra, and Merkur.  </li>
            <li>They were comfortable to shave with, but the shave was not close at all.</li>
            <li>This is a great pack if you want to try out different blades for your DE.  </li>
            <li>Great combo pack, let&#x27;s you try different blades and find what you like.</li>
            <li>the rest are cheap</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing, be prepared to bleed and enjoy a couple days of irritation afterward...</li>
            <li>more note, don&#x27;t buy the one blade sample packs, as you need to try them more than once to really appreciate if they work or not...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a good sampler pack that helped me find my favorite blade (Astra) and introduced me to how well the Feather, Silver Blue and Bluebird shave as well.</li>
            <li>All of these razors are good but some are better than others, I personally prefer the feather ones because of the closeness of the shave i get with them.</li>
            <li>They also require you to be a bit more careful, however they are very nice.  </li>
            <li>Gave me a clean shave and comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>Derby&#x27;s had varied results, with one blade leaving a clean close smooth shave and another itching as I was shaving with it.</li>
            <li>Gillette 7&#x27;o clocks; Pretty darn good blade for comfort and very forgiving but could be a tad bit</li>
            <li>I think getting this variety pack is a great way to start if you are new to shaving with a straight razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s strong enough to hold a good edge.    </li>
            <li>The [[ASIN:B0022R947O Feathers]] were my first favorite.  </li>
            <li>After all of this reading of reviews, I was most interested in trying Feather, Astra, Shark, and Bluebird.</li>
            <li>Pretty sure I&#x27;m settling on the Astra SP, if anyone was wondering</li>
            <li>Shipping was originally dated for like 2 weeks</li>
            <li>Lovely first shave, rapidly downhill after that.  </li>
            <li>Glad I tried this, and would highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving with an Edwin Jagger DE89L razor for the past six months or so, along with the Van der Haagen Luxury Kit, and this has been a wonderful experience.</li>
            <li>All the blades are individually wrapped in paper, which is adorable, or, as adorable as razor blades can be :)</li>
            <li>nice little sampler of preferred, higher-end blades at a fair price.</li>
            <li>Light passes for beard gradual reduction are the only way to get a good bloodless shave for me.    </li>
            <li>I am so happy that I decided to purchase this sample pack before I committed to buying a single brand in bulk.</li>
            <li>35 blades, including Feather and Shark, is great for someone looking to get into wet shaving.</li>
            <li>These are maybe the best blades overall since I&#x27;ve had really really good and comfortable shaves with them, although not as close as Blue Bird (see above) or Feather (see below).</li>
            <li>These are maybe the best blades overall since I´ve had really really good and comfortable shaves with them, although not as close as Blue Bird (see above) or Feather (see below).</li>
            <li>This is my preferred blade for shaving a full beard.</li>
            <li>The Gillette Platinums on are good blades that seem to last forever...</li>
            <li>Good way totry out different brands.</li>
            <li>Good for only one shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>5 blades is enough to get a good feel of them, I find</li>
            <li>yeah, I guess it&#x27;s really true.</li>
            <li>a good mix of the brands that I&#x27;ve seen name-dropped the most often, either as top brands (e.g., feather &amp; 7 o&#x27;clock) or common but well reviewed brands (e.g., derby).</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re all different and a sample kit is a wise choice.</li>
            <li>I think I will try one more time with a much lighter touch.</li>
            <li>100 Astra Superior Premium Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades]]  </li>
            <li>- I have read several good reviews of this blade - must have been a QC issue</li>
            <li>These blades are better than any modern 3 or 5 blades system that cost 3-5 dollars per set.</li>
            <li>Not bad at all.  </li>
            <li>A pack like this can help you find the right fit for you.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For me the platinum coated German blades were best, the Russian Gillette and Astra were close seconds.</li>
            <li>took off one star because the only thing that would have made this kit perfect is if  it included the Personna Lab Blue blades.  </li>
            <li>Also they keep their mild sharpness longer than feather.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Everyone&#x27;s face is different and the ONLY way to find out what works best for you is to try them all</li>
            <li>Most of them do well, with the Feather and the Astra being my favorites (also got some Kroger blades at the same time, and i&#x27;m amazed that they do just as well as most of these).</li>
            <li>Astras and Derbys are equally the longest lasting and best value.</li>
            <li>The package arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s face is different and the only way to find out the best combo for your face and razor is to buy a sampler pack like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shark Super Chrome: 3.5&lt;br /&gt;Blue</li>
            <li>A great way to try a bunch of different blades at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>The vendor shipped the items quickly, and all items are as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>Astra Super Platinum and Feather</li>
            <li>I went through these in various &amp;#34;rounds&amp;#34; to determine which were the best for me, considering my current kit.</li>
            <li>They are awesome and I will never go back to using a standard razor to shave my legs ever again.  </li>
            <li>A bit more expensive this way, but worth it to learn which blade works best for you.</li>
            <li>- good conistent shave just not quite as close - minor pulling on day 5</li>
            <li>Going to keep trying new ones until I find a favorite</li>
            <li>Pretty solid sample set and good introduction to DE shaving.  </li>
            <li>Good starter pack if your interested in trying out different brands.</li>
            <li>Its just not the best blade for shaving (at least not for everyone)!</li>
            <li>I am new to shaving with a DE razor and this kit was great to test drive different types of razors.</li>
            <li>There are too many variations in hair and skin types to declare a single blade better than others for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A nice set of double edge (DE) blades to try out if you want to sample blades for your razor.</li>
            <li>All blades are popular commercial brands with varying qualities.</li>
            <li>I have tried most of them thus far.  </li>
            <li>Well worth trying these out before you settle on one razor blade.</li>
            <li>Everyone gives their personal opinion (almost fanatically, in some cases), and your experience will be your own; not theirs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Feather is my favorite so far.  </li>
            <li>It was fun to take a tour of the world with my face each morning.  </li>
            <li>The thrill of that alone is worth trying a sampler pack.  </li>
            <li>All were still better than the old cartridges I was used to.  </li>
            <li>Defently worth it to try out a lot of blades</li>
            <li>So far the Shark is my favorite, but I have not tried all the blades yet.  </li>
            <li>It was not a miracle worker, as far as the ingrown hairs, but they are noticeably better and continuing to improve.  </li>
            <li>but it was nice to get to try out different brands.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s worth it in the end to find that one blade.</li>
            <li>So far I like the Fearher blades the most.</li>
            <li>So far the Gillette and feather blades are my favorite</li>
            <li>Sample packs are nice because they let you have enough of one blade to see how well it works</li>
            <li>This is why this simple sampler truly came in handy.</li>
            <li>I bought a 1962 Gillette Super Speed from Ebay, which came with some Super Max Super Stainless blades, which I also review here.    </li>
            <li>A good shave for me is when it slides over my beard with minimal rasping.  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;feather&amp;#34; blades are by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not done with them all but at the cost, I figure the experiment is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sharks:  Seem more aggressive, but any difficulties I had were solved when I wet the lather a bit more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve shaved with 4 of these brands so far, and I am really glad I had the opportunity to try these brands.</li>
            <li>Provides a good example of different blades with enough blades to try in many razors ea blade may</li>
            <li>A nice sample pack to try different blades to determine what you prefer.  </li>
            <li>Now after doing a lot more research, I know that the only really good blades in this pack are the Feathers, Silver Blue, and maybe Bluebirds -</li>
            <li>Buy the Astra 100 blade pack or whatever reputable company offers for 10 bucks and never need a blade again.    </li>
            <li>Not bad on first shave, but tugged after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I subsequently bought other blades to sample, but this sampler was the best.  </li>
            <li>I now know that I love the gillette blades, thought the astra and the shark blades are ok, and I wouldn&#x27;t buy the other three.</li>
            <li>Super Max Super Stainless (not in this pack).  </li>
            <li>So I see a deal on 200 Super Max Super Stainless for $17.00, and I&#x27;m taking that.  </li>
            <li>how good the actual blades are, since it&#x27;s main purpose is to supply a basis for comparison</li>
            <li>Wish4Star ARE VERY CUSTOMER FRIENDLY.  </li>
            <li>My progression took me through four of the seven options, until I  found the right one for me.  </li>
            <li>Now I know I&#x27;m getting the right blade for my face.</li>
            <li>The Sharks are my go-to blade, with the Feather, Derby, and Astra brands coming in right after.</li>
            <li>All the blades arrived promptly and I&#x27;ve begun using them as a means to figure out which razors will be the right ones for me.</li>
            <li>I find that the number of blades is right to get a feel for how the blades perform.</li>
            <li>Gillete 7 O&#x27;clock: I was surprised at my first shave with these, better than Astra (see below), but</li>
            <li>Shaving should be fun, and not dreaded, and this helps you get excited for new blades!</li>
            <li>I cut my neck up pretty good not realizing how sharp it was and</li>
            <li>I was able to test a different blade, each week, and with notes on each shave, I was able to narrow down the 2 best blades for me.</li>
            <li>I have only used one blade, but the first shave was perfect and the second was better than any other blade I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Shark - A very sharp blade, yet still gave good results.  </li>
            <li>Stainless steel, for my skin type, feels WAY better by far.</li>
            <li>Allows you try a few different brands/origins and find the blade you like best.</li>
            <li>Shark Super Stainless:</li>
            <li>These made it to the 5th and final round and provide an awesome shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to wet shaving and wanted to try the different blades to see what worked best for my skin.</li>
            <li>I received exactly what was promised in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>Since I have switched to DE razors, I can shave every day (for the first time since I was in my teens) and my skin no longer burns</li>
            <li>first time around I used each blade for one week, and switched brands frequently.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The [[ASIN:B001QY8QXM Astras]] were the first blade I ran out of.  </li>
            <li>Definitely some choices, not sure if I notice the difference or not, but it&#x27;s a great deal for a lot of razors!!!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to work my way through them all so i can settle on my favorite to buy in quantity later.</li>
            <li>received these blades exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>this pack for yourself and you&#x27;ll more than likely find a blade that works well for you.</li>
            <li>Derby&#x27;s came with my Edwin Jagger razor, and while they&#x27;re ok they do not shave as well as the ones mentioned above.  </li>
            <li>Reading hundreds of reviews for specific blades, and many more from the various samplers out there, I ended up selecting this sampler because it looked like it had the highest percentage of recognizable brands without including a lot of no-name brands that no one seems to like or care about.  </li>
            <li>I did not like the Derbys the first time I used them</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be able to try and switch to a different brand.</li>
            <li>2nd favorite was the Shark.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t have found all this out without a sample pack like this to test many different brands.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>The Astra, however, worked well from the first shave.  </li>
            <li>I could consistently get 3 shaves from each blade without my face and neck looking</li>
            <li>Bird: 3.5&lt;br /&gt;Gillette Silver Blue: 3.25&lt;br /&gt;Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock: 3</li>
            <li>So for a sample pack it does exactly what its supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I bought this sampler pack with my first safety razor.</li>
            <li>I got exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>First time DE safety razor user and</li>
            <li>Having the ability to try several different blades with the razor to get the best shave is definitely a plus.  </li>
            <li>Given its first shave is similar to Feather but it lasts better, at 30% of the cost, this is a winner.    </li>
            <li>I recognize it is not practical for the individual manufacturers, but it would be better</li>
            <li>even got through the first blade, let alone opened another package.</li>
            <li>It was exactly as shown in the picture and the description.</li>
            <li>I was mostly interested in the Bluebird, Feather, Astra and Derby blades.</li>
            <li>These were the first I tried since I received 5 of them with my razor.</li>
            <li>After seeing as how this company puts customers first, I am changing over to 5 stars, and will continue to use this company from now on.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The blades came packaged in a ziplock baggie and were exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>Check out maggardrazors.com and get a sampler of exactly which blades you want to try.</li>
            <li>blade selection was exactly what you see in the photo.  </li>
            <li>- consistently close - sharpest - exceptional&lt;br /&gt;Astra &amp; Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock - consistent not quite as close as the first two still a pleasure to use&lt;br /&gt;Bluebird</li>
            <li>- close shave first</li>
            <li>these blades will shave off the slightest of bumps or imperfections on your face - comparable to a freshly honed straight razor.  </li>
            <li>and I think I like the Gilette blade the most, but that&#x27;s me, you will be different.</li>
            <li>Comes with five of each, which is good when you find a few brands you like</li>
            <li>Derby - really not sharp, though seemingly fairly easy to avoid bloodshed.    </li>
            <li>Smooth, sharp first shave glides through the beard like butter, good 2nd and OK 3rd.  </li>
            <li>I am new to double edge razors and this sampler pack has come in handy.  </li>
            <li>I also have to shave against the grain to get a smooth shave, which only works with a sharp blade in good condition.    </li>
            <li>Silver Blue - improvement over the 7 o&#x27;clocks, sharp and smooth, and fairly rugged (4-5 shaves per</li>
            <li>The only drawbacks are that the sharpness doesn´t seem to last as long (you get maybe three perfect shaves per blade) and</li>
            <li>I had heard the feathers were the best, but so far for me, the 2 gillette&#x27;s (especially the dark blue platinum plus) gave the best results with least irritation.  </li>
            <li>Feather is a very aggressive blade (many say the sharpest on the market), Astra falls kinda in the middle.</li>
            <li>I appreciated the ability to buy a sample pack of many different razor blades.  </li>
            <li>Blue Bird - Got a good amount of pulling and several nicks.</li>
            <li>Good for trying out several different types and brands.  </li>
            <li>I bought this and went through every single brand, and found that Feather and the Blue Bird were my favorite with Feather on top by quite a lot.</li>
            <li>So far so good they don&#x27;t last as long as the sample but cheap for the price</li>
            <li>beard is particularly curly, and grows right alongside my skin--so I am prone to having ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>As such, this was an excellent product for the purpose of trying different blades for wet shaving.</li>
            <li>However, a good mix should get any amateur started.  </li>
            <li>This is a decent sampler pack and has a few good blade choices, but I believe it is overpriced.</li>
            <li>Gillette blue - not sharp, but kind forgiving</li>
            <li>The third shave was not as good, but depending on exactly how long between shaves (24 vs 36 vs 48), sometimes the third shave was fine too.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the rest to varying results with the 7 o&#x27;clock and Derby being far to mild for my liking.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used them all yet, but so far the Gillette 7 o&#x27; clock super platinum works like a charm for me.</li>
            <li>Used with the Parker 99R.&lt;br /&gt;Gillette Silver Blue - consistently close, irritation free - felt as if was gliding across my skin.  </li>
            <li>After about ten shaves, it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>Helped narrow down which razors work best for my face.</li>
            <li>I ended up ordering a large pack of Merkur when I was done with these.</li>
            <li>Being new to the double edge safety razor (switched from disposables), I am already finding out that I get a much better shave with Astra blades vs. some of the others.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard a lot of people talk about blades in the wet shaving community, and gathered the choice of blades could be very important.  </li>
            <li>I used it for a third shave and it was fine.</li>
            <li>Pretty decent selection of blades.</li>
            <li>The picture changes between the main product page and the Cart page!</li>
            <li>But certainly you will see a difference in products, so there&#x27;s no sense in buying a whole lot of one type of blade just to find out</li>
            <li>This is important because as your DE technique improves you may find (like I did) that a blade you had initially not liked is actually a favorite.  </li>
            <li>This set really helps you to get a feel of the different blades available.  </li>
            <li>Probably will order Astra next time because they are so cheap.</li>
            <li>I just got into wet shaving, and most places have a minimum of 25 blades.  </li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know that thanks to this pack.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting there to be that much of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really enjoy trying different brands of razors and this did the trick.</li>
            <li>I did not expect to like the Sharks as much as I did</li>
            <li>Purchased this sampler when I decided to switch from the cartridge ripoff scam and begin REAL shaving with a DE razor.  </li>
            <li>Check on line for wet shaving forums to learn more.</li>
            <li>This sample set really helped me figure out what blades to buy for my safety razor.  </li>
            <li>After trying all of the blades, you can really tell the difference in the way the blades are made.  </li>
            <li>and this kit will allow you to find one you like (unless you&#x27;re unusually picky.)</li>
            <li>And if your realy not carefull you will have much irritation afterwards.</li>
            <li>They are also reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For some reason the feather blades don&#x27;t have this problem as much.  </li>
            <li>Everyone lauded the greatness of Feather blades but no matter how gently I shaved, I always got razor burn.</li>
            <li>I was skeptic about the whole &amp;#34;Not</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Great set of starter blades for anyone getting into the safety razor shaving game.</li>
            <li>The Derby&#x27;s were very acceptable.  </li>
            <li>The Shark&#x27;s REALLY deserve their name.  </li>
            <li>A lot of people really like them</li>
            <li>Not too much to it.</li>
            <li>At that price I may only use each one for two shaves, and enjoy the luxury.  </li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to trying the Bluebird razors, but imagine my suprise when they were not part of the pack.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li>i dont have to spend 20 bucks on a set of  4 popular triple blade razors only to have to buy them again the next month.</li>
            <li>but I think you&#x27;ll be satified with this sampler which includes a selection of commonly found, good quality blades.</li>
            <li>For example, I almost bought a bulk pack of Shark blades because I had used and liked them a few years ago.</li>
            <li>I have so far only shaved with the cheapest/dullest blade in the bunch, and I am in love.  </li>
            <li>like this pack for being able to try out several different types of blades to figure out which is the right one for me.</li>
            <li>I wasnt looking forward to the new blade and its first 2</li>
            <li>They do not retain their sharpness long with course hair and also easily cut the skin.</li>
            <li>This set of blades can last you for an year and are much cheaper and environmentally friendly than anything else.</li>
            <li>won&#x27;t review each one since the choice of blade is a very personal one and everyone&#x27;s skin is unique</li>
            <li>Other people love the Feather.  </li>
            <li>It was the perfect way to try several different blade brands without spending a small fortune.  </li>
            <li>there were as many companies making DE blades until I found this (and other) packs.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using a DE razor, so I don&#x27;t have any worthwhile feedback other than they fit in my Merkur Futur as expected.</li>
            <li>I really like that this particular sampler includes a five-pack of each blade.</li>
            <li>I was ready to get the highly rated Feathers but someone convinced me to try a sample pack.  </li>
            <li>worth the purchase for new or old DE users.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Derby and Astra - smooth blades but pretty dull... only good for daily shaving / touchups - not</li>
            <li>Its a smart choice to go with something like this when you&#x27;re new to shaving with a safety razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure different brands of stainless steel razors will work differently</li>
            <li>Purchasing a full box of blades without knowing if they will &amp;#34;match&amp;#34; your face is a risky and possibly damaging move.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this sample pack along with my first safety razor and was pleasantly surprised at the variability between brands.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways, my opinion is to many people jump to feather because it is the hands down sharpest blade...</li>
            <li>Each person&#x27;s facial hair is distinct in its coarseness and thickness, and different blades respond uniquely.</li>
            <li>have also discovered that a 2-pass shave morning and nightly is better than one 3-pass shave every morning (closer shaves and less irritation).</li>
            <li>The [[ASIN:B002DZ0N5W Blue Birds]] are my current favorite.  </li>
            <li>I chose this pack over the 32 pack sampler, which includes 16 different blade brands, because I preferred to have more blades of the brand that worked, instead of trying them all and only having two blades of my preferred brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recently switched to a safety razor in an effort to save some money on those rediculously expensive razor cartridges and during my research phase I found that there is not one perfect blade that you should buy.  </li>
            <li>and it does that with a decent selection.</li>
            <li>I found this to be a decent sample pack.  </li>
            <li>The rest I&#x27;ve given to my girlfriend, who was lucky enough to have finer hair.</li>
            <li>Only complaint is some of the blades aren&#x27;t that great</li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s face is different, and different blades better suit people and</li>
            <li>The results are as good with these as the previous two *as long* as I&#x27;m doing a 3-pass shave.    </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this assortment.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure your results will be different, but if you&#x27;re new to DE shaving, definitely try out some blades before settling on one.</li>
            <li>As each razor, skin, and beard hair is different, it is really hard to figure out based on other people&#x27;s reviews which blade is going to give you a great comfortable shave with ease.  </li>
            <li>Close, comfortable, sharp and the blades last a full week with no signs of losing any performance.</li>
            <li>but so far I&#x27;m really liking them all (except the feathers).</li>
            <li>And if you don&#x27;t care for some of these, you&#x27;ve wasted your money by paying more for them and having them sit forever in your drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can decide what kind of blade you like instead of being stuck with a lot of blades that you might not like if you were forced just buying one type.</li>
            <li>I have a very course beard and need a very sharp blade to get through it smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Feathers are easily the sharpest blade and most expensive.</li>
            <li>Picking the blade that is right for you is such a pain.  </li>
            <li>Still pricey for seven 5-packs, but necessary if you&#x27;re looking for the right blade for your face.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new to safety razors like I was, getting one of these was critical to finding the right blade.</li>
            <li>/&gt;#4 - Astra: Was comfortable, but not as sharp as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sharp yes, comfortable no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bluebird - smooth, sharp blade...</li>
            <li>When I first got into DE shaving, I used a couple blades from a friend but couldn&#x27;t find one that seemed right, so based off the other reviews, bought this pack.  </li>
            <li>you are new to DE as your technique will improve and so will the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(New</li>
            <li>I am new to safety razor shaving.</li>
            <li>This morning I put in a new blade and started to shave.  </li>
            <li>Being new to DE razor shaving</li>
            <li>If you are new to DE shaving you will need to buy one of the sampler packs.</li>
            <li>I recommend it for anyone new to shaving.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new to DE shaving, a blade sample pack is a must.</li>
            <li>I bought this sampler pack because I was new to DE shaving and didn&#x27;t know what I was looking for yet.  </li>
            <li>They are a dirt cheap, versatile blade (plenty sharp and reasonably gentle), but they didn&#x27;t last very long.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Blue Bird; Not much to say about these other than they were slightly more comfortable than the Sharks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Having five blades each really helps you determine what actually works best instead of whether or not you simply had a particularly good or bad shave as a result of other variables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All aforementioned blades were included and in brand new condition.</li>
            <li>Feathers will be last, since I heard they are the sharpest and only used for advanced shavers.</li>
            <li>They are gentler on my skin than the feathers and allow for more passes with less razor burn (good for addressing those difficult areas).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 28 y/o caucasian, with almost sensitive skin and regular (not thin, not coarse), full (grows evenly on my face) beard.</li>
            <li>I know these are not in the pack, but I got three good shaves out of each blade (by shave, I mean a double or triple pass shave).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Bought when I first switched to using a double edged razor to shave.  </li>
            <li>this is your first attempt at DE shaving, leave the Feathers for last.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try each type for several shaves, as the first time after you switch might not be representative of how it will work on a continuous basis.  </li>
            <li>Caused irritation on first shave, only used twice and then threw all the blades away.</li>
            <li>The set has done exactly what I wanted and allowed me to try multiple blades over time to find one I like.  </li>
            <li>Wow, no pulling at all!  </li>
            <li>Better shave with no more bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>being my first shave with a double edge.</li>
            <li>I also enjoyed the Feather blades (although the seemed a tad sharp) as well as the Blue Bird and Derby ones.  </li>
            <li>DERBY EXTRA is the first blade I tried.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Derby - pulled on first day - switched it out - same</li>
            <li>Exactly what it says a sampler pack of double edged razors.  </li>
            <li>Like many other reviews, this allows you to try out a few popular brands that make the double edged flat blade replacement.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I also owned a few electric shavers that were good, but always broke down and new models show up every year.</li>
            <li>Astra; Good in both the comfort and sharpness category but not good enough to be my go to blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This pack made it so easy to test out different blades without all the running around or ordering individual packs from various sites.</li>
            <li>I wanted to like the Feather, but it is far too aggressive for my face and technique and most times left my feeling slightly razor burned with not as close a shave as I could get out the Astra.</li>
            <li>The first three shave with the feather were great,after that started get a few weepers, these blades are real sharp, make sure your angle is right with this blades.trying to stick to the same blade</li>
            <li>I quickly learned that the Feather blades are way too sharp for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try some different blades out, because it&#x27;s clear that people have strong preferences one way or the other.  </li>
            <li>(although I did have to clean up my shaving technique, because this style razor gives you less margin for error).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>that I clearly know what I like</li>
            <li>Derby is the clear winner for me.</li>
            <li>They are sharper than the others, so you have to be a bit more careful; just don&#x27;t press on the razor, let gravity do the work as the experts on wet shaving advise.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried from 2 packs so far and have been please with the results from both.  </li>
            <li>If I could only have one blade this might very well be it.&lt;br /&gt;...</li>
            <li>Found that the Astra and Feather blades are the sharpest by far.</li>
            <li>So far Feather and Bluebird have it.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be surprised at the differences.</li>
            <li>Still working my way through them, but really surprised at the difference.  </li>
            <li>I found it early and have some reluctance to keep trying.  </li>
            <li>I have gone through 6 of the 7 types of blades and was surprised at the difference in feel between each blade.  </li>
            <li>Clearly it&#x27;s by far the sharpest.  </li>
            <li>The buildup doesn&#x27;t happen nearly as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, what do you do with the old blades when you are finished with them?  </li>
            <li>The Derby cuts my face something harsh, but the Shark is smooth against my skin and no irritation.</li>
            <li>Ultimately I went with the Gillette 7 O clock and the Feather Stainless.</li>
            <li>He tried different shave creams but nothing seemed to help that much</li>
            <li>so I did some research and surprised him with a Merkur safety razor to try.  </li>
            <li>A very close second is the Gillette Silver-Blue.  </li>
            <li>brand I rated highest was by far the Feather blades.</li>
            <li>Item delivered as described and a day early.</li>
            <li>So here is where I am so far on these blades:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hi Stainless Double Edge Blades]]</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s manly, classy, reliable and affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this variety pack and it changed the whole experiencing of shaving entirely.</li>
            <li>We shall see after trying the Feather&#x27;s next but with a fresh edge each day, I think I will ultimately go for the value.</li>
            <li>Almost the same results with only a couple nicks on rare occasion.</li>
            <li>These were dropped on round 4 only because they were super consistent throughout all rounds</li>
            <li>These were dropped on round 4 only because they were super consistent throughout all rounds</li>
            <li>I know that the right blade depends on different beard types and facial structures, but I wanted to rate the blades in case it could help others:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Out of the seven brands in this sampler, I found two I really liked, a few that were decent and useable and a few that I will never use again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>$21 for 35 blades is pretty steep, especially considering I only found a couple of choices that worked for me.</li>
            <li>These are sharp blades, and zoom right through whiskers.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend starting this way, and then figuring out what you want to use going forward.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend if you are just starting to shave this way that you try packs like this.</li>
            <li>like I was back in high school with acne.  </li>
            <li>I only wish that it had included Persona Israeli Reds, a highly recommended brand.</li>
            <li>But for me, it was too rough during the first shave.  </li>
            <li>I got this kit when I first started wet shaving.</li>
            <li>If your just wet shaving try this first.</li>
            <li>i wish i would have heard of this safety razor business earlier, it saves so much money time and effort having everything i need right there in my little shaving box/tub.</li>
            <li>The Gillette blades seemed a little dull for my taste though, although they also seemed to give good results.</li>
            <li>These little razors arrived quickly and as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Bought these to go with a new razor to test out different brands of blades.  </li>
            <li>Personally, as a man with thicker hair, I find that using the Feather blades once with the grain and the second stroke against the grain gives a much cleaner look and feel.</li>
            <li>I think then it would have truly covered all the major brands of blades; and for me, my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are not sharp and they cut off your face.</li>
            <li>They all appear to be the exact same size and shape (which makes sense since they&#x27;re all designed to be used in the same application), they all feel like they&#x27;re the exact same thickness, and they&#x27;re all sharp as ...</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s a shame as they are sharp and not expensive.  </li>
            <li>Does this mean it will only get better?  </li>
            <li>of the blades, while cheap, are popular because they&#x27;re forgiving (Astra, Derby), but if you have a thick heavy beard they probably will not be sharp enough for you.  </li>
            <li>Taylor of Old Bond Street soap, when used as dry as possible, works very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shark - cheap blade that starts off sharp but dulls after 1-2 shaves&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recommended this particular sampler to several friends over the last year.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy them, but I am having a hard time finding them to buy on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Every face is different so, I&#x27;d highly recommend trying out several before settling on one brand of razor.</li>
            <li>So back to the old technology double-edge razor I went -</li>
            <li>I was surprised how different each brand feels.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found Feather and Blue Birds to be my preferred blades so far as they are the sharpest of the bunch.</li>
            <li>bought this pack to help decide which blades I like, The Gillette Blue And Astra are my favorites so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only tried one blade of each shark, derby and feather so far.</li>
            <li>After learning DE shaving with shave soap and badger brush, I cant go back to my old way.</li>
            <li>I barely finished one shave with these and put them away.</li>
            <li>used 3 different blades so far in Jagger 89.  </li>
            <li>Offers a chance to try several blade manufacturers.</li>
            <li>I tried two of them, thinking maybe the first blade I tried was a lemon, but I completely discarded them at round 2.</li>
            <li>; Hands down from the first time I tried this blade</li>
            <li>The picture shows the yellow package New Hi-Stainless, and the ones I received were the black/silver packaging reading Feather Hi-Stainless Double Edge.</li>
            <li>It s very sharp wouldn&#x27;t recommend as using for your first shave.</li>
            <li>one positive - no irritation even with multiple passes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock - sharp but not very smooth or consistent blade</li>
            <li>They are amazingly sharp blades and require you to know what you are doing, otherwise you can really cut yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These blades are so sharp that you really just need to let them do all the work.  </li>
            <li>: the Feather and Blue Bird are my personal favorites so far.  </li>
            <li>I am 1/2 African American 1/2 polish with corse curly hair and soft carmel colord skin.  </li>
            <li>nothing wrong with it just like the Derby better so far.  </li>
            <li>Bought this pack after a little research on trying different blades to find the right one for my face.</li>
            <li>decently priced way to mess with some different blades... new to DE</li>
            <li>Though this set is more expensive than a pack of a single brand of blades, it is still far, FAR cheaper than the &amp;#34;supersonic&amp;#34; blades I used to buy.</li>
            <li>Second is a bit rough, third is very ropey.  </li>
            <li>With the less sharp blades it&#x27;s easy to make a nick and have it gush blood for a long time.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new to wet shaving with safety razors</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new to wet shaving with a safety razor or still experimenting with different blades, then give it a try!</li>
            <li>Being new to using a safety razor, he was curious about the performance of different blades.  </li>
            <li>Pretty decent, but not great, for 3 shaves    4.  </li>
            <li>I only new of Derby and one other (not in the pack) before and had no idea</li>
            <li>A mix of good blades and bad .... depends on your beard and skin.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> I am not going to say that this is the best sampler pack, but this was the best sampler pack for me.</li>
            <li> This is the best way to get into DE shaving.  </li>
            <li> Well because for me the best shave came from blades that where not platinum lubricated and where not known as the sharper blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This sampler pack fits the bill perfectly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d always just bought a pack of feathers because that&#x27;s what everyone said were the best.</li>
            <li> Well for me, they are not the best.</li>
            <li> These are excellent razor blades.</li>
            <li> some of the best blades from all over the world.</li>
            <li> They both have given the best and closest shaves.</li>
            <li> Great deal!</li>
            <li> The included Gillette, Shark, and Feather blades were the best for me.</li>
            <li> However there is truth that the best blade for me may not be your best blade so please take this review with a grain of salt and try them for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My boyfriend just got a safety razor and we were so unsure of which blade brand would work best.  </li>
            <li> Great product!</li>
            <li> me the Astras worked best for my head and the feathers worked best for my neck.  </li>
            <li> The Astra razors are the ones a like the best</li>
            <li> my face and the way I shave, the Astra is the perfect blade.</li>
            <li> It helped me determine which blade I like best with my razor.  </li>
            <li> This sampler is the best option I&#x27;ve seen yet to help with your decision.    </li>
            <li> These felt the best with the fewest nicks.</li>
            <li> so ,I know which blades works best for me.</li>
            <li> this was awesome for getting a feel for blade differences.</li>
            <li> the included 7 O&#x27;Clocks are an excellent match for me.  </li>
            <li> Doing a sampler pack is the best way to figure out which ones you like for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So this (shaving with double-edge safety blades), I believe, is the perfect system.</li>
            <li> (you get maybe three perfect shaves per blade) and</li>
            <li> Its great!</li>
            <li> While the mistake happened, and mistakes happen with anyone, I am seriously impressed with the customer service, and quality of care I received.</li>
            <li> Still trying to figure out which works best for me...</li>
            <li> Used this to find out that Durby and Astra are the rasers that work best with my face.  </li>
            <li> For example, I bought and excellent razor, but I did not like the blades it came with</li>
            <li> Shaving with those blades is the best experience and the best feel after shaving.</li>
            <li> This selection is very, very good.</li>
            <li> Still a very good razor.  </li>

            <li> The Astra&#x27;s were the best, followed by the Gillette Silver Blues and Feathers, with the Bluebirds performing well but not as good as the Astra&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a good sample pack I am still working on which ones I like the best.  </li>
            <li> Also, gives a person a chance to try the dfferent blades for a good price to find the one that works best for his beard and face.</li>
            <li> I found I like Wilkinson the best, but still a good pack.</li>

            <li> Some of what I really liked, others seemed to dislike and</li>
            <li> This is a nice sampler pack.</li>
            <li> These blades gave a nice shave.  </li>
            <li> Nice sampler kit.  </li>
            <li> Nice collection of blades as a sample.</li>
            <li> So here is my list of the ones I liked and their prices on Amazon in the order of price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These provided the absolute best shave in both comfort and closeness.</li>
            <li> These provided the absolute best shave in both comfort and closeness.</li>
            <li> I bought a Edwin Jagger razor that came with Derby blades, which I liked so</li>
            <li> Great way to try out a bunch of different brands and find out which work best without spending a lot of money.</li>
            <li> Nice sample pack to get you started on your own DE razor addiction.</li>
            <li> particular sampler was perfect for me, because I wanted to try Derby, Feather, Astra and Gillette.</li>
            <li> Excellent set of high quality blades.  </li>
            <li> Good selection of damn good blades for the NOOB wet shaver to try out and see what works best for them.</li>
            <li> I am new to DE shaving and want to find the cheapest, best blades for my shave.</li>
            <li> Allowed me to determine which blades worked best with my new razor.</li>
            <li> Being relatively new to DS/wet shaving I needed a way to see which blade truly does work best for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good survey of available blades - some I liked and some</li>
            <li> Keep up the great work, and know that how you treat customers is sometimes more important than the product itself.</li>
            <li> great assortment, and quick ship.</li>
            <li> Be sure to use nice shaving cream/lotion like Shiseido.</li>
            <li> Thankfully I was able to find one that I liked.</li>
            <li> It has a selction of the more popular blades out there.</li>
            <li> of the brands in this sampler are good and gave me close, comfortable shaves.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You should buy a sampler kit, and among the ones available on Amazon, this is quite a good one.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, the Derby blades seem to be the best for my skin.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best idea for anyone getting into DE shaving.  </li>
            <li> These were far and away the best blades for me.  </li>
            <li> So far the Feathers work best for me</li>
            <li> And well worth the money to find a blade I&#x27;m happy with.</li>
            <li> I bought this to figure out what kind of blades I will like the most.</li>
            <li> So far I like the Derby blade the best.  </li>
            <li> I like shark the best so far.  </li>
            <li> Great start for anyone trying to find the right blade.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, the &amp;#34;duller&amp;#34; blades such as Astra and Derby give me the best shaves and feel nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> It gives you a nice start for testing out various blade options so you can see what works best for you.  </li>
            <li> Was nice to have multiple brands to find the one I like the best... which I did!</li>
            <li> The offering was pretty great.</li>
            <li> Great variety for a first timer.</li>
            <li> They seemed to be a good balance of between mild and aggressive.  </li>
            <li> that being said, this sampler pack helped me zero in on my favorite, which was the Feathers.</li>
            <li> Without having bought this sample set, I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to find my blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad the offer sample packs like this.  </li>
            <li> Out of the set, the Derby are the most forgiving, although I get razor bumps from them.  </li>
            <li> Safety razor blades are not a product where sharper means better.  </li>
            <li> The 7 o&#x27;clock blades were ok for my beard, however the rest were like shaving with a cheese grater.  </li>
            <li> After 30+ years of using twin (and more) blade disposables, I was getting too many ingrown whiskers.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did</li>
            <li> The [[ASIN:B004SGKMA0 Derbys]] are sure to remain in my arsenal.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;*for better results with glued blades, insert the blade with the glue spots facing the handle.&lt;br /&gt;PS.</li>
            <li> I would bet that any shaver will find his/her favorite brand by getting this sampler pack.</li>
            <li> but i am glad i got it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m much better off with an Astra, or Gillette blade.</li>
            <li> The best thing is that this pack will probably last me a year</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally the Astra and and the Feathers have been my favorite.</li>
            <li> plan on doing more testing to figure out which is my favorite,</li>
            <li> I should state I never use a blade for more than 3 shaves</li>
            <li> This sampler had most of the blades I wanted to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Best overall in terms of sharpness, durability, and effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Some work better than others based on my beard type and the razor.  </li>
            <li> The advice you get on many message boards is correct:  buy a sampler pack and try different blades to find what works best for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the feel of the Feather blade.  </li>
            <li> You have to try several and see which one works the best for you!  </li>
            <li> Amount of blades provided in each sample was appropriate for testing.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure if I had tried all of them</li>
            <li> /&gt;You&#x27;ll pay more though.</li>
            <li> Shark and Derby so-so, Gillette blades made in Russia better.</li>
            <li> Shark blades; for me these were the most uncortable.</li>
            <li> ; I know many here love these</li>
            <li> I bought this sampler to find what blade I would find most</li>
            <li> Many choices and many prices.  </li>
            <li> My favorite was the Feather.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping for better from the Bluebird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The feather package comes with a safe disposal container.  </li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be purchasing this product again for myself, but I do plan on giving a safety razor set as a gift to a friend, and I&#x27;ll be sure to include this package.</li>
            <li> It provides some interesting variety.</li>
            <li> This was a great decision on my part before investing in a whole 100 pack of something I wouldn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried all of the blades yet, but some do a better job than others and that is why I wanted to purchase this.  </li>
            <li> Sharpest isn&#x27;t always better and brand quality may surprise you.</li>
            <li> After leaving sams club spending $100 on 28 gillette cartridges, I thought there has got to be a better way.  </li>
            <li> so he hasn&#x27;t decided on a favorite blade yet</li>
            <li> but it arrived within a week which was much better.</li>
            <li> and perhaps I&#x27;ll revisit them if I&#x27;m feeling adventurous</li>
            <li> ; tried a couple, found one that feels better than the rest on MY FACE (the Astra) and bought a hundred of them...</li>
            <li> This is the best way to decide on which blade you&#x27;re going to use (a very personal choice).  </li>
            <li> That is OKAY.  </li>
            <li> More came than is listed in the listing.  </li>
            <li> More words.</li>
            <li> As with most people every result is quite different depending on the blade which works best for them.</li>
            <li> An excelent range of blades to help you find your favorite.</li>
            <li> The only way to find out which blades are best for you is to try them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I took the gamble and bought the Crystal Platinums and was glad I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been experimenting with each in turn, and once I settle on my favorite, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll buy from here on out.</li>
            <li> lots of blades,lots of choices,and inexpensive.what more could you want?</li>
            <li> Glad</li>
            <li> so wasn&#x27;t sure which ones to purchase.  </li>
            <li> I will try one more blade, but if this happens again, I will discard these like I did with the Sharks.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> I love the Astras.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give these another go, just to be sure, and update this review</li>
            <li> and I was looking mostly for the closest shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Conclusion: The last three blades are all magnificent.</li>
            <li> and I was looking mostly for the closest shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Conclusion: The last three blades are all magnificent.</li>
            <li> I am sure I will like some of the others though.</li>
            <li> I bought them because I&#x27;m trying out different blades in order to figure out which ones will work best for shaving my legs.  </li>
            <li> I found that Feathers, Sharks and Astra&#x27;s cut best through my coarse hair, with Astra&#x27;s leaving the smoothest shave.</li>
            <li> Very impressed with the Gillette Silver Blue and 7 o&#x27;clock based on their 50/100 count price online, may end up going with those.</li>
            <li> Started shaving with a safety razor about a year ago and this sample pack is an awesome way to get a feel for different blades.</li>
            <li> Cant beat the price either :-)</li>
            <li> All the lil boxes are cute and I cant wait to try them out.</li>
            <li> The Feather ones were my favorite though</li>
            <li> If you buy a razor definitely buy a variety pack to try out and find the perfect blade for your skin.</li>
            <li> and I love it:</li>
            <li> Picked this up to sample what was out there... and I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Good place to start to find the right blade.</li>
            <li> Someone suggested to me that I get a sampler (since I&#x27;m a first time safety razor user) to get a sense of what works best for my skin... and this certainly provided that assortment.</li>
            <li> Very Useful!</li>
            <li> Nice, selection of blades from the sharpest to the more mild.</li>
            <li> Gives me a chance to sample various blades, the Astra and Feather are very good, Derby is OK, the rest, although better than cartridge, are not keepers for me although I know people that like them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Astra - Tried these first based on forums and a friend&#x27;s recommendation as a good starter blade.  </li>
            <li> Good selection of what is considered the higher end DE blades.  </li>
            <li> Great way for a new DE user to try a variety of blades.</li>
            <li> Great purchase with new razor.</li>
            <li> This was a great sample starter kit for a new found hobby that I hope to master soon.</li>
            <li> Great priced sampler pack for the new safety razor user (me).  </li>
            <li> Everything was packed nice and was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> The best blades are cheap enough to use by anyone.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They are quite pricey for only 35 blades ($18.50 when I bought them) but a very good way to see what suits your needs and face..</li>
            <li> This sampler pack gives you an assortment of blades to try for a very good price, I&#x27;d highly recommend it to anyone looking to find the right safety razor blade for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> is that I can now shave with every blade comfortably, though some are markedly better than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Having 5 of each allows you to revisit those blades once you are more comfortable with the DE razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , I found that some of the blades were really rough on my face (the Gillette and Shark blades), others didn&#x27;t shave as closely (Astra and Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock) and the blade I like best is the Feather</li>
            <li> Great way to try out several different razor brands to find out what works best.</li>
            <li> This nice collection of blades should help you find the right blade for your type of shaving needs.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny! :)</li>
            <li> Great way to test blades more than once, and now my wife and I can try different blades for our DE shavers with out having to compromise on who gets what.</li>
            <li> If Feather (see below) is a 10/10 in closeness, these are easily a 9.5/10.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another good point about this particular sampler is the range of aggressiveness that you have here.</li>
            <li> Good variety of blades all of high quality.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This pack is great for people who are starting out with wet shaving, and who are trying to figure out what blade works best - which is something I&#x27;d recommend you do before you buy a pack of just one brand.</li>
            <li> I chose this one over other available sampler packs on Amazon because the brand of blades that are included in this one seemed to have the best reputation.  </li>
            <li> I wish that this pack included the Crystal Platinums, but this is still a good pack to start with as most likely you&#x27;ll find a favorite in here.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock - These blades worked pretty well with a nice close first shave and a perfectly acceptable 2nd shave.  </li>
            <li> Feather - Another very sharp blade that wasn&#x27;t the best for me.</li>
            <li> A good blade for someone new to shaving with a DE razor perhaps.  </li>
            <li> Sampler packs in general are ingenius tools at the wetshaver&#x27;s disposal, since the whole point is to find the best razor blade for your face/gear combination.</li>
            <li> Got everything I wanted in the same exact packaging as pictured, and the blades are great!</li>
            <li> Derby is considered by many as a rather mild blade.</li>
            <li> Very nice selection of the top blades on the market - essential for finding the one blade &#x27;Right&#x27; for you !</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been enjoying the Feather, and Astra blades the most!</li>
            <li> Great for the new DE shavers looking for the right blade.</li>
            <li> Maybe good for light beards and/or sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> Great way to sample several brands.</li>
            <li> sampler is a great way to test drive a bunch of different blades.  </li>
            <li> B00875XSIQ Gillette Stainless]] didn&#x27;t seem to be as nice as the Platinums.  </li>
            <li> The Derby&#x27;s are fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Great way to try different brands.</li>
            <li> Great way to sample different brands before buying in bulk.</li>
            <li> I have a feeling that in the end I will end up using the Astra blades as they are cheap</li>
            <li> Completely comfortable.  </li>
            <li> but all of them, with the safety razor as a whole, have provided a much more enjoyable, comfortable shaving experience.  </li>
            <li> But I am *really* happy with the Silver Blue and the Feathers.</li>
            <li> Great collection to get started and explore different blades.</li>
            <li> I have read elsewhere that Feathers are the sharpest blades available.</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought this variety pack, but I suppose that I am not as sensitive as others, I really cannot find a great deal of difference between the Bluebird, Astra, and Merkur.  </li>
            <li> They were comfortable to shave with, but the shave was not close at all.</li>
            <li> This is a great pack if you want to try out different blades for your DE.  </li>
            <li> Great combo pack, let&#x27;s you try different blades and find what you like.</li>
            <li> the rest are cheap</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing, be prepared to bleed and enjoy a couple days of irritation afterward...</li>
            <li> more note, don&#x27;t buy the one blade sample packs, as you need to try them more than once to really appreciate if they work or not...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, a good sampler pack that helped me find my favorite blade (Astra) and introduced me to how well the Feather, Silver Blue and Bluebird shave as well.</li>
            <li> All of these razors are good but some are better than others, I personally prefer the feather ones because of the closeness of the shave i get with them.</li>
            <li> They also require you to be a bit more careful, however they are very nice.  </li>
            <li> Gave me a clean shave and comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> Derby&#x27;s had varied results, with one blade leaving a clean close smooth shave and another itching as I was shaving with it.</li>
            <li> Gillette 7&#x27;o clocks; Pretty darn good blade for comfort and very forgiving but could be a tad bit</li>
            <li> I think getting this variety pack is a great way to start if you are new to shaving with a straight razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s strong enough to hold a good edge.    </li>
            <li> The [[ASIN:B0022R947O Feathers]] were my first favorite.  </li>
            <li> After all of this reading of reviews, I was most interested in trying Feather, Astra, Shark, and Bluebird.</li>
            <li> Pretty sure I&#x27;m settling on the Astra SP, if anyone was wondering</li>
            <li> Shipping was originally dated for like 2 weeks</li>
            <li> Lovely first shave, rapidly downhill after that.  </li>
            <li> Glad I tried this, and would highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with an Edwin Jagger DE89L razor for the past six months or so, along with the Van der Haagen Luxury Kit, and this has been a wonderful experience.</li>
            <li> All the blades are individually wrapped in paper, which is adorable, or, as adorable as razor blades can be :)</li>
            <li> nice little sampler of preferred, higher-end blades at a fair price.</li>
            <li> Light passes for beard gradual reduction are the only way to get a good bloodless shave for me.    </li>
            <li> I am so happy that I decided to purchase this sample pack before I committed to buying a single brand in bulk.</li>
            <li> 35 blades, including Feather and Shark, is great for someone looking to get into wet shaving.</li>
            <li> These are maybe the best blades overall since I&#x27;ve had really really good and comfortable shaves with them, although not as close as Blue Bird (see above) or Feather (see below).</li>
            <li> These are maybe the best blades overall since I´ve had really really good and comfortable shaves with them, although not as close as Blue Bird (see above) or Feather (see below).</li>
            <li> This is my preferred blade for shaving a full beard.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Platinums on are good blades that seem to last forever...</li>
            <li> Good way totry out different brands.</li>
            <li> Good for only one shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 5 blades is enough to get a good feel of them, I find</li>
            <li> yeah, I guess it&#x27;s really true.</li>
            <li> a good mix of the brands that I&#x27;ve seen name-dropped the most often, either as top brands (e.g., feather &amp; 7 o&#x27;clock) or common but well reviewed brands (e.g., derby).</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re all different and a sample kit is a wise choice.</li>
            <li> I think I will try one more time with a much lighter touch.</li>
            <li> 100 Astra Superior Premium Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades]]  </li>
            <li> - I have read several good reviews of this blade - must have been a QC issue</li>
            <li> These blades are better than any modern 3 or 5 blades system that cost 3-5 dollars per set.</li>
            <li> Not bad at all.  </li>
            <li> A pack like this can help you find the right fit for you.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For me the platinum coated German blades were best, the Russian Gillette and Astra were close seconds.</li>
            <li> took off one star because the only thing that would have made this kit perfect is if  it included the Personna Lab Blue blades.  </li>
            <li> Also they keep their mild sharpness longer than feather.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s face is different and the ONLY way to find out what works best for you is to try them all</li>
            <li> Most of them do well, with the Feather and the Astra being my favorites (also got some Kroger blades at the same time, and i&#x27;m amazed that they do just as well as most of these).</li>
            <li> Astras and Derbys are equally the longest lasting and best value.</li>
            <li> The package arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s face is different and the only way to find out the best combo for your face and razor is to buy a sampler pack like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shark Super Chrome: 3.5&lt;br /&gt;Blue</li>
            <li> A great way to try a bunch of different blades at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> The vendor shipped the items quickly, and all items are as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> Astra Super Platinum and Feather</li>
            <li> I went through these in various &amp;#34;rounds&amp;#34; to determine which were the best for me, considering my current kit.</li>
            <li> They are awesome and I will never go back to using a standard razor to shave my legs ever again.  </li>
            <li> A bit more expensive this way, but worth it to learn which blade works best for you.</li>
            <li> - good conistent shave just not quite as close - minor pulling on day 5</li>
            <li> Going to keep trying new ones until I find a favorite</li>
            <li> Pretty solid sample set and good introduction to DE shaving.  </li>
            <li> Good starter pack if your interested in trying out different brands.</li>
            <li> Its just not the best blade for shaving (at least not for everyone)!</li>
            <li> I am new to shaving with a DE razor and this kit was great to test drive different types of razors.</li>
            <li> There are too many variations in hair and skin types to declare a single blade better than others for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A nice set of double edge (DE) blades to try out if you want to sample blades for your razor.</li>
            <li> All blades are popular commercial brands with varying qualities.</li>
            <li> I have tried most of them thus far.  </li>
            <li> Well worth trying these out before you settle on one razor blade.</li>
            <li> Everyone gives their personal opinion (almost fanatically, in some cases), and your experience will be your own; not theirs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Feather is my favorite so far.  </li>
            <li> It was fun to take a tour of the world with my face each morning.  </li>
            <li> The thrill of that alone is worth trying a sampler pack.  </li>
            <li> All were still better than the old cartridges I was used to.  </li>
            <li> Defently worth it to try out a lot of blades</li>
            <li> So far the Shark is my favorite, but I have not tried all the blades yet.  </li>
            <li> It was not a miracle worker, as far as the ingrown hairs, but they are noticeably better and continuing to improve.  </li>
            <li> but it was nice to get to try out different brands.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s worth it in the end to find that one blade.</li>
            <li> So far I like the Fearher blades the most.</li>
            <li> So far the Gillette and feather blades are my favorite</li>
            <li> Sample packs are nice because they let you have enough of one blade to see how well it works</li>
            <li> This is why this simple sampler truly came in handy.</li>
            <li> I bought a 1962 Gillette Super Speed from Ebay, which came with some Super Max Super Stainless blades, which I also review here.    </li>
            <li> A good shave for me is when it slides over my beard with minimal rasping.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;feather&amp;#34; blades are by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not done with them all but at the cost, I figure the experiment is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sharks:  Seem more aggressive, but any difficulties I had were solved when I wet the lather a bit more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shaved with 4 of these brands so far, and I am really glad I had the opportunity to try these brands.</li>
            <li> Provides a good example of different blades with enough blades to try in many razors ea blade may</li>
            <li> A nice sample pack to try different blades to determine what you prefer.  </li>
            <li> Now after doing a lot more research, I know that the only really good blades in this pack are the Feathers, Silver Blue, and maybe Bluebirds -</li>
            <li> Buy the Astra 100 blade pack or whatever reputable company offers for 10 bucks and never need a blade again.    </li>
            <li> Not bad on first shave, but tugged after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I subsequently bought other blades to sample, but this sampler was the best.  </li>
            <li> I now know that I love the gillette blades, thought the astra and the shark blades are ok, and I wouldn&#x27;t buy the other three.</li>
            <li> Super Max Super Stainless (not in this pack).  </li>
            <li> So I see a deal on 200 Super Max Super Stainless for $17.00, and I&#x27;m taking that.  </li>
            <li> how good the actual blades are, since it&#x27;s main purpose is to supply a basis for comparison</li>
            <li> Wish4Star ARE VERY CUSTOMER FRIENDLY.  </li>
            <li> My progression took me through four of the seven options, until I  found the right one for me.  </li>
            <li> Now I know I&#x27;m getting the right blade for my face.</li>
            <li> The Sharks are my go-to blade, with the Feather, Derby, and Astra brands coming in right after.</li>
            <li> All the blades arrived promptly and I&#x27;ve begun using them as a means to figure out which razors will be the right ones for me.</li>
            <li> I find that the number of blades is right to get a feel for how the blades perform.</li>
            <li> Gillete 7 O&#x27;clock: I was surprised at my first shave with these, better than Astra (see below), but</li>
            <li> Shaving should be fun, and not dreaded, and this helps you get excited for new blades!</li>
            <li> I cut my neck up pretty good not realizing how sharp it was and</li>
            <li> I was able to test a different blade, each week, and with notes on each shave, I was able to narrow down the 2 best blades for me.</li>
            <li> I have only used one blade, but the first shave was perfect and the second was better than any other blade I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Shark - A very sharp blade, yet still gave good results.  </li>
            <li> Stainless steel, for my skin type, feels WAY better by far.</li>
            <li> Allows you try a few different brands/origins and find the blade you like best.</li>
            <li> Shark Super Stainless:</li>
            <li> These made it to the 5th and final round and provide an awesome shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to wet shaving and wanted to try the different blades to see what worked best for my skin.</li>
            <li> I received exactly what was promised in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> Since I have switched to DE razors, I can shave every day (for the first time since I was in my teens) and my skin no longer burns</li>
            <li> first time around I used each blade for one week, and switched brands frequently.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The [[ASIN:B001QY8QXM Astras]] were the first blade I ran out of.  </li>
            <li> Definitely some choices, not sure if I notice the difference or not, but it&#x27;s a great deal for a lot of razors!!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to work my way through them all so i can settle on my favorite to buy in quantity later.</li>
            <li> received these blades exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> this pack for yourself and you&#x27;ll more than likely find a blade that works well for you.</li>
            <li> Derby&#x27;s came with my Edwin Jagger razor, and while they&#x27;re ok they do not shave as well as the ones mentioned above.  </li>
            <li> Reading hundreds of reviews for specific blades, and many more from the various samplers out there, I ended up selecting this sampler because it looked like it had the highest percentage of recognizable brands without including a lot of no-name brands that no one seems to like or care about.  </li>
            <li> I did not like the Derbys the first time I used them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be able to try and switch to a different brand.</li>
            <li> 2nd favorite was the Shark.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have found all this out without a sample pack like this to test many different brands.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> The Astra, however, worked well from the first shave.  </li>
            <li> I could consistently get 3 shaves from each blade without my face and neck looking</li>
            <li> Bird: 3.5&lt;br /&gt;Gillette Silver Blue: 3.25&lt;br /&gt;Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock: 3</li>
            <li> So for a sample pack it does exactly what its supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I bought this sampler pack with my first safety razor.</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> First time DE safety razor user and</li>
            <li> Having the ability to try several different blades with the razor to get the best shave is definitely a plus.  </li>
            <li> Given its first shave is similar to Feather but it lasts better, at 30% of the cost, this is a winner.    </li>
            <li> I recognize it is not practical for the individual manufacturers, but it would be better</li>
            <li> even got through the first blade, let alone opened another package.</li>
            <li> It was exactly as shown in the picture and the description.</li>
            <li> I was mostly interested in the Bluebird, Feather, Astra and Derby blades.</li>
            <li> These were the first I tried since I received 5 of them with my razor.</li>
            <li> After seeing as how this company puts customers first, I am changing over to 5 stars, and will continue to use this company from now on.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> The blades came packaged in a ziplock baggie and were exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> Check out maggardrazors.com and get a sampler of exactly which blades you want to try.</li>
            <li> blade selection was exactly what you see in the photo.  </li>
            <li> - consistently close - sharpest - exceptional&lt;br /&gt;Astra &amp; Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock - consistent not quite as close as the first two still a pleasure to use&lt;br /&gt;Bluebird</li>
            <li> - close shave first</li>
            <li> these blades will shave off the slightest of bumps or imperfections on your face - comparable to a freshly honed straight razor.  </li>
            <li> and I think I like the Gilette blade the most, but that&#x27;s me, you will be different.</li>
            <li> Comes with five of each, which is good when you find a few brands you like</li>
            <li> Derby - really not sharp, though seemingly fairly easy to avoid bloodshed.    </li>
            <li> Smooth, sharp first shave glides through the beard like butter, good 2nd and OK 3rd.  </li>
            <li> I am new to double edge razors and this sampler pack has come in handy.  </li>
            <li> I also have to shave against the grain to get a smooth shave, which only works with a sharp blade in good condition.    </li>
            <li> Silver Blue - improvement over the 7 o&#x27;clocks, sharp and smooth, and fairly rugged (4-5 shaves per</li>
            <li> The only drawbacks are that the sharpness doesn´t seem to last as long (you get maybe three perfect shaves per blade) and</li>
            <li> I had heard the feathers were the best, but so far for me, the 2 gillette&#x27;s (especially the dark blue platinum plus) gave the best results with least irritation.  </li>
            <li> Feather is a very aggressive blade (many say the sharpest on the market), Astra falls kinda in the middle.</li>
            <li> I appreciated the ability to buy a sample pack of many different razor blades.  </li>
            <li> Blue Bird - Got a good amount of pulling and several nicks.</li>
            <li> Good for trying out several different types and brands.  </li>
            <li> I bought this and went through every single brand, and found that Feather and the Blue Bird were my favorite with Feather on top by quite a lot.</li>
            <li> So far so good they don&#x27;t last as long as the sample but cheap for the price</li>
            <li> beard is particularly curly, and grows right alongside my skin--so I am prone to having ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> As such, this was an excellent product for the purpose of trying different blades for wet shaving.</li>
            <li> However, a good mix should get any amateur started.  </li>
            <li> This is a decent sampler pack and has a few good blade choices, but I believe it is overpriced.</li>
            <li> Gillette blue - not sharp, but kind forgiving</li>
            <li> The third shave was not as good, but depending on exactly how long between shaves (24 vs 36 vs 48), sometimes the third shave was fine too.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the rest to varying results with the 7 o&#x27;clock and Derby being far to mild for my liking.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them all yet, but so far the Gillette 7 o&#x27; clock super platinum works like a charm for me.</li>
            <li> Used with the Parker 99R.&lt;br /&gt;Gillette Silver Blue - consistently close, irritation free - felt as if was gliding across my skin.  </li>
            <li> After about ten shaves, it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> Helped narrow down which razors work best for my face.</li>
            <li> I ended up ordering a large pack of Merkur when I was done with these.</li>
            <li> Being new to the double edge safety razor (switched from disposables), I am already finding out that I get a much better shave with Astra blades vs. some of the others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard a lot of people talk about blades in the wet shaving community, and gathered the choice of blades could be very important.  </li>
            <li> I used it for a third shave and it was fine.</li>
            <li> Pretty decent selection of blades.</li>
            <li> The picture changes between the main product page and the Cart page!</li>
            <li> But certainly you will see a difference in products, so there&#x27;s no sense in buying a whole lot of one type of blade just to find out</li>
            <li> This is important because as your DE technique improves you may find (like I did) that a blade you had initially not liked is actually a favorite.  </li>
            <li> This set really helps you to get a feel of the different blades available.  </li>
            <li> Probably will order Astra next time because they are so cheap.</li>
            <li> I just got into wet shaving, and most places have a minimum of 25 blades.  </li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know that thanks to this pack.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting there to be that much of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really enjoy trying different brands of razors and this did the trick.</li>
            <li> I did not expect to like the Sharks as much as I did</li>
            <li> Purchased this sampler when I decided to switch from the cartridge ripoff scam and begin REAL shaving with a DE razor.  </li>
            <li> Check on line for wet shaving forums to learn more.</li>
            <li> This sample set really helped me figure out what blades to buy for my safety razor.  </li>
            <li> After trying all of the blades, you can really tell the difference in the way the blades are made.  </li>
            <li> and this kit will allow you to find one you like (unless you&#x27;re unusually picky.)</li>
            <li> And if your realy not carefull you will have much irritation afterwards.</li>
            <li> They are also reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For some reason the feather blades don&#x27;t have this problem as much.  </li>
            <li> Everyone lauded the greatness of Feather blades but no matter how gently I shaved, I always got razor burn.</li>
            <li> I was skeptic about the whole &amp;#34;Not</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Great set of starter blades for anyone getting into the safety razor shaving game.</li>
            <li> The Derby&#x27;s were very acceptable.  </li>
            <li> The Shark&#x27;s REALLY deserve their name.  </li>
            <li> A lot of people really like them</li>
            <li> Not too much to it.</li>
            <li> At that price I may only use each one for two shaves, and enjoy the luxury.  </li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to trying the Bluebird razors, but imagine my suprise when they were not part of the pack.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li> i dont have to spend 20 bucks on a set of  4 popular triple blade razors only to have to buy them again the next month.</li>
            <li> but I think you&#x27;ll be satified with this sampler which includes a selection of commonly found, good quality blades.</li>
            <li> For example, I almost bought a bulk pack of Shark blades because I had used and liked them a few years ago.</li>
            <li> I have so far only shaved with the cheapest/dullest blade in the bunch, and I am in love.  </li>
            <li> like this pack for being able to try out several different types of blades to figure out which is the right one for me.</li>
            <li> I wasnt looking forward to the new blade and its first 2</li>
            <li> They do not retain their sharpness long with course hair and also easily cut the skin.</li>
            <li> This set of blades can last you for an year and are much cheaper and environmentally friendly than anything else.</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t review each one since the choice of blade is a very personal one and everyone&#x27;s skin is unique</li>
            <li> Other people love the Feather.  </li>
            <li> It was the perfect way to try several different blade brands without spending a small fortune.  </li>
            <li> there were as many companies making DE blades until I found this (and other) packs.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a DE razor, so I don&#x27;t have any worthwhile feedback other than they fit in my Merkur Futur as expected.</li>
            <li> I really like that this particular sampler includes a five-pack of each blade.</li>
            <li> I was ready to get the highly rated Feathers but someone convinced me to try a sample pack.  </li>
            <li> worth the purchase for new or old DE users.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Derby and Astra - smooth blades but pretty dull... only good for daily shaving / touchups - not</li>
            <li> Its a smart choice to go with something like this when you&#x27;re new to shaving with a safety razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure different brands of stainless steel razors will work differently</li>
            <li> Purchasing a full box of blades without knowing if they will &amp;#34;match&amp;#34; your face is a risky and possibly damaging move.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this sample pack along with my first safety razor and was pleasantly surprised at the variability between brands.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways, my opinion is to many people jump to feather because it is the hands down sharpest blade...</li>
            <li> Each person&#x27;s facial hair is distinct in its coarseness and thickness, and different blades respond uniquely.</li>
            <li> have also discovered that a 2-pass shave morning and nightly is better than one 3-pass shave every morning (closer shaves and less irritation).</li>
            <li> The [[ASIN:B002DZ0N5W Blue Birds]] are my current favorite.  </li>
            <li> I chose this pack over the 32 pack sampler, which includes 16 different blade brands, because I preferred to have more blades of the brand that worked, instead of trying them all and only having two blades of my preferred brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recently switched to a safety razor in an effort to save some money on those rediculously expensive razor cartridges and during my research phase I found that there is not one perfect blade that you should buy.  </li>
            <li> and it does that with a decent selection.</li>
            <li> I found this to be a decent sample pack.  </li>
            <li> The rest I&#x27;ve given to my girlfriend, who was lucky enough to have finer hair.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is some of the blades aren&#x27;t that great</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s face is different, and different blades better suit people and</li>
            <li> The results are as good with these as the previous two *as long* as I&#x27;m doing a 3-pass shave.    </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this assortment.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sure your results will be different, but if you&#x27;re new to DE shaving, definitely try out some blades before settling on one.</li>
            <li> As each razor, skin, and beard hair is different, it is really hard to figure out based on other people&#x27;s reviews which blade is going to give you a great comfortable shave with ease.  </li>
            <li> Close, comfortable, sharp and the blades last a full week with no signs of losing any performance.</li>
            <li> but so far I&#x27;m really liking them all (except the feathers).</li>
            <li> And if you don&#x27;t care for some of these, you&#x27;ve wasted your money by paying more for them and having them sit forever in your drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can decide what kind of blade you like instead of being stuck with a lot of blades that you might not like if you were forced just buying one type.</li>
            <li> I have a very course beard and need a very sharp blade to get through it smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Feathers are easily the sharpest blade and most expensive.</li>
            <li> Picking the blade that is right for you is such a pain.  </li>
            <li> Still pricey for seven 5-packs, but necessary if you&#x27;re looking for the right blade for your face.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to safety razors like I was, getting one of these was critical to finding the right blade.</li>
            <li> /&gt;#4 - Astra: Was comfortable, but not as sharp as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sharp yes, comfortable no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bluebird - smooth, sharp blade...</li>
            <li> When I first got into DE shaving, I used a couple blades from a friend but couldn&#x27;t find one that seemed right, so based off the other reviews, bought this pack.  </li>
            <li> you are new to DE as your technique will improve and so will the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (New</li>
            <li> I am new to safety razor shaving.</li>
            <li> This morning I put in a new blade and started to shave.  </li>
            <li> Being new to DE razor shaving</li>
            <li> If you are new to DE shaving you will need to buy one of the sampler packs.</li>
            <li> I recommend it for anyone new to shaving.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to DE shaving, a blade sample pack is a must.</li>
            <li> I bought this sampler pack because I was new to DE shaving and didn&#x27;t know what I was looking for yet.  </li>
            <li> They are a dirt cheap, versatile blade (plenty sharp and reasonably gentle), but they didn&#x27;t last very long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Blue Bird; Not much to say about these other than they were slightly more comfortable than the Sharks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Having five blades each really helps you determine what actually works best instead of whether or not you simply had a particularly good or bad shave as a result of other variables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All aforementioned blades were included and in brand new condition.</li>
            <li> Feathers will be last, since I heard they are the sharpest and only used for advanced shavers.</li>
            <li> They are gentler on my skin than the feathers and allow for more passes with less razor burn (good for addressing those difficult areas).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 28 y/o caucasian, with almost sensitive skin and regular (not thin, not coarse), full (grows evenly on my face) beard.</li>
            <li> I know these are not in the pack, but I got three good shaves out of each blade (by shave, I mean a double or triple pass shave).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Bought when I first switched to using a double edged razor to shave.  </li>
            <li> this is your first attempt at DE shaving, leave the Feathers for last.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try each type for several shaves, as the first time after you switch might not be representative of how it will work on a continuous basis.  </li>
            <li> Caused irritation on first shave, only used twice and then threw all the blades away.</li>
            <li> The set has done exactly what I wanted and allowed me to try multiple blades over time to find one I like.  </li>
            <li> Wow, no pulling at all!  </li>
            <li> Better shave with no more bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> being my first shave with a double edge.</li>
            <li> I also enjoyed the Feather blades (although the seemed a tad sharp) as well as the Blue Bird and Derby ones.  </li>
            <li> DERBY EXTRA is the first blade I tried.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Derby - pulled on first day - switched it out - same</li>
            <li> Exactly what it says a sampler pack of double edged razors.  </li>
            <li> Like many other reviews, this allows you to try out a few popular brands that make the double edged flat blade replacement.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I also owned a few electric shavers that were good, but always broke down and new models show up every year.</li>
            <li> Astra; Good in both the comfort and sharpness category but not good enough to be my go to blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This pack made it so easy to test out different blades without all the running around or ordering individual packs from various sites.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like the Feather, but it is far too aggressive for my face and technique and most times left my feeling slightly razor burned with not as close a shave as I could get out the Astra.</li>
            <li> The first three shave with the feather were great,after that started get a few weepers, these blades are real sharp, make sure your angle is right with this blades.trying to stick to the same blade</li>
            <li> I quickly learned that the Feather blades are way too sharp for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try some different blades out, because it&#x27;s clear that people have strong preferences one way or the other.  </li>
            <li> (although I did have to clean up my shaving technique, because this style razor gives you less margin for error).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> that I clearly know what I like</li>
            <li> Derby is the clear winner for me.</li>
            <li> They are sharper than the others, so you have to be a bit more careful; just don&#x27;t press on the razor, let gravity do the work as the experts on wet shaving advise.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried from 2 packs so far and have been please with the results from both.  </li>
            <li> If I could only have one blade this might very well be it.&lt;br /&gt;...</li>
            <li> Found that the Astra and Feather blades are the sharpest by far.</li>
            <li> So far Feather and Bluebird have it.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be surprised at the differences.</li>
            <li> Still working my way through them, but really surprised at the difference.  </li>
            <li> I found it early and have some reluctance to keep trying.  </li>
            <li> I have gone through 6 of the 7 types of blades and was surprised at the difference in feel between each blade.  </li>
            <li> Clearly it&#x27;s by far the sharpest.  </li>
            <li> The buildup doesn&#x27;t happen nearly as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, what do you do with the old blades when you are finished with them?  </li>
            <li> The Derby cuts my face something harsh, but the Shark is smooth against my skin and no irritation.</li>
            <li> Ultimately I went with the Gillette 7 O clock and the Feather Stainless.</li>
            <li> He tried different shave creams but nothing seemed to help that much</li>
            <li> so I did some research and surprised him with a Merkur safety razor to try.  </li>
            <li> A very close second is the Gillette Silver-Blue.  </li>
            <li> brand I rated highest was by far the Feather blades.</li>
            <li> Item delivered as described and a day early.</li>
            <li> So here is where I am so far on these blades:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hi Stainless Double Edge Blades]]</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s manly, classy, reliable and affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this variety pack and it changed the whole experiencing of shaving entirely.</li>
            <li> We shall see after trying the Feather&#x27;s next but with a fresh edge each day, I think I will ultimately go for the value.</li>
            <li> Almost the same results with only a couple nicks on rare occasion.</li>
            <li> These were dropped on round 4 only because they were super consistent throughout all rounds</li>
            <li> These were dropped on round 4 only because they were super consistent throughout all rounds</li>
            <li> I know that the right blade depends on different beard types and facial structures, but I wanted to rate the blades in case it could help others:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Out of the seven brands in this sampler, I found two I really liked, a few that were decent and useable and a few that I will never use again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> $21 for 35 blades is pretty steep, especially considering I only found a couple of choices that worked for me.</li>
            <li> These are sharp blades, and zoom right through whiskers.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend starting this way, and then figuring out what you want to use going forward.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you are just starting to shave this way that you try packs like this.</li>
            <li> like I was back in high school with acne.  </li>
            <li> I only wish that it had included Persona Israeli Reds, a highly recommended brand.</li>
            <li> But for me, it was too rough during the first shave.  </li>
            <li> I got this kit when I first started wet shaving.</li>
            <li> If your just wet shaving try this first.</li>
            <li> i wish i would have heard of this safety razor business earlier, it saves so much money time and effort having everything i need right there in my little shaving box/tub.</li>
            <li> The Gillette blades seemed a little dull for my taste though, although they also seemed to give good results.</li>
            <li> These little razors arrived quickly and as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Bought these to go with a new razor to test out different brands of blades.  </li>
            <li> Personally, as a man with thicker hair, I find that using the Feather blades once with the grain and the second stroke against the grain gives a much cleaner look and feel.</li>
            <li> I think then it would have truly covered all the major brands of blades; and for me, my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are not sharp and they cut off your face.</li>
            <li> They all appear to be the exact same size and shape (which makes sense since they&#x27;re all designed to be used in the same application), they all feel like they&#x27;re the exact same thickness, and they&#x27;re all sharp as ...</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s a shame as they are sharp and not expensive.  </li>
            <li> Does this mean it will only get better?  </li>
            <li> of the blades, while cheap, are popular because they&#x27;re forgiving (Astra, Derby), but if you have a thick heavy beard they probably will not be sharp enough for you.  </li>
            <li> Taylor of Old Bond Street soap, when used as dry as possible, works very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shark - cheap blade that starts off sharp but dulls after 1-2 shaves&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recommended this particular sampler to several friends over the last year.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy them, but I am having a hard time finding them to buy on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Every face is different so, I&#x27;d highly recommend trying out several before settling on one brand of razor.</li>
            <li> So back to the old technology double-edge razor I went -</li>
            <li> I was surprised how different each brand feels.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found Feather and Blue Birds to be my preferred blades so far as they are the sharpest of the bunch.</li>
            <li> bought this pack to help decide which blades I like, The Gillette Blue And Astra are my favorites so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried one blade of each shark, derby and feather so far.</li>
            <li> After learning DE shaving with shave soap and badger brush, I cant go back to my old way.</li>
            <li> I barely finished one shave with these and put them away.</li>
            <li> used 3 different blades so far in Jagger 89.  </li>
            <li> Offers a chance to try several blade manufacturers.</li>
            <li> I tried two of them, thinking maybe the first blade I tried was a lemon, but I completely discarded them at round 2.</li>
            <li> ; Hands down from the first time I tried this blade</li>
            <li> The picture shows the yellow package New Hi-Stainless, and the ones I received were the black/silver packaging reading Feather Hi-Stainless Double Edge.</li>
            <li> It s very sharp wouldn&#x27;t recommend as using for your first shave.</li>
            <li> one positive - no irritation even with multiple passes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock - sharp but not very smooth or consistent blade</li>
            <li> They are amazingly sharp blades and require you to know what you are doing, otherwise you can really cut yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These blades are so sharp that you really just need to let them do all the work.  </li>
            <li> : the Feather and Blue Bird are my personal favorites so far.  </li>
            <li> I am 1/2 African American 1/2 polish with corse curly hair and soft carmel colord skin.  </li>
            <li> nothing wrong with it just like the Derby better so far.  </li>
            <li> Bought this pack after a little research on trying different blades to find the right one for my face.</li>
            <li> decently priced way to mess with some different blades... new to DE</li>
            <li> Though this set is more expensive than a pack of a single brand of blades, it is still far, FAR cheaper than the &amp;#34;supersonic&amp;#34; blades I used to buy.</li>
            <li> Second is a bit rough, third is very ropey.  </li>
            <li> With the less sharp blades it&#x27;s easy to make a nick and have it gush blood for a long time.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to wet shaving with safety razors</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to wet shaving with a safety razor or still experimenting with different blades, then give it a try!</li>
            <li> Being new to using a safety razor, he was curious about the performance of different blades.  </li>
            <li> Pretty decent, but not great, for 3 shaves    4.  </li>
            <li> I only new of Derby and one other (not in the pack) before and had no idea</li>
            <li> A mix of good blades and bad .... depends on your beard and skin.</li>
            <li> too.&lt;br /&gt;So far Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock has given me the smoothest shave that hasn&#x27;t been too sharp.</li>
            <li> The only drawbacks are that the sharpness doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long</li>
            <li> I may stick to Astra as my main, go-to, everyday blades and Feather as my &amp;#34;special occasion&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I may stick to Astra as my main, go-to, everyday blades and Feather as my &amp;#34;special occasion&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The included blades are grey market imports from the Middle East.</li>
            <li> Some of the other brands got dull too quickly and caused nics and razor burn.</li>
            <li> Had I not, I might have been turned off to wet-shaving very quickly as the blade that came with my safety razor was quite uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I have tried about half of those blades so far</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re switching to Double Edge (DE) wet shaving, you have to try a lot of different blades when you start out.</li>
            <li> at round 2, I felt some &amp;#34;tug and pull&amp;#34;, which were also present on round 3, where they were dropped, so they may not be as consistent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Packaging was simple and unobtrusive, and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the blades themselves, other than the anticipated blade incompatibility with my facial hair and razor type.</li>
            <li> If you or your other half has a safety razor, I highly recommend this sampler.  </li>
            <li> To get a better feel for your shave quality apply aftershave before rinsing with cold water (as well as after).&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> The Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock blades start sharper but don&#x27;t hold their edge as long.</li>
            <li> Now I use Mekur long handle, Feather blades, and Proraso pre-shave and soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel like I may have noticed minor differences between them, but nothing has made me say, &amp;#34;Oh</li>
            <li> That way, there really is no point in enduring the &amp;#34;tug and pull&amp;#34; from Blue Birds.</li>
            <li> I found the first 2 shaves to be harsh but not as harsh as a feather.  </li>
            <li> This product allowed him to try several types for an extended period and was extremely affordable.  </li>
            <li> This blade is plenty sharp enough for my beard.&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;m going to give a bad review because I fell in love with the Astra and Feather blades almost instantly.  </li>
            <li> I used a second one to make sure it wasn&#x27;t a bad blade.  </li>
            <li> I have a dark red beard peppered with bigger thicker dark whiskers which are wide and flat instead of round.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Feather gives me the smoothest single pass shave imaginable.</li>
            <li> I wish I had got the sampler of single blades rather than 5 packs</li>
            <li> All three were a single blade that was used for a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Though the feather blades you receive might come in a black package, the blades are the same as those in the yellow package, even though one says \\&quot;platinum\\&quot; and the other doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> A clean shave, but several nicks made it a little uncomfortable after a couple shaves on each blade.  </li>
            <li> If you have tried DE (double edge) before and were disappointed or discouraged, I would suggest trying one of these sampler packs and seeing if another blade won&#x27;t work better for you.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I was at first skeptical that each brand of blade would have a distinctive feel, after all they are simple double-edged blades.</li>
            <li> one of the boxes of blades seemed to be open slightly, but I think the adhesive just didn&#x27;t survive shipping.</li>
            <li> The sample pack would last for a while if I used all the blades, but I ended up buying a bulk pack of the Astra before I even finished half of this pack.</li>
            <li> Just one caution:  The FEATHER blades may come packaged under a silver and black label instead of the yellow one pictured.  </li>
            <li> The product page shows a yellow Feather package but when you add it to cart and look at it in the cart, the black and silver Feathers are shown.</li>
            <li> I had three major nicks and my skin felt raw.</li>
            <li> and I tried 5 of them previously with my handle purchase and cannot see spending the extra money for other blades.  </li>
            <li> but not too many to regret purchasing a bad one.  </li>
            <li> There are enough blades here to last you at least 4 months.</li>
            <li> Do some research, find a few blades that theoretically work for you, and then try to find a sampler that has most/all of the blades you want to try.&lt;br</li>
            <li> rough</li>
            <li> So I made the jump to wet shavng with a DE saftey razor and all the forums and advice columns</li>
            <li> I bought this pack because even though I&#x27;ve dabbled in wet shaving on and off over the years</li>
            <li> If you are just getting into the &amp;#34;Art of Wet Shaving&amp;#34; You can not beat the price</li>
            <li> The 7O&#x27;Clock greens and the Sharks were not comfortable for me, and I have some left which I&#x27;ll probably never use (on my face at least).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t like DE wet shaving, it&#x27;s not DE</li>
            <li> I listened to others and ended up almost giving up on wet shaving altogether.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I had read reviews of a few of these blades and wanted to try each of them before I committed to a larger order.  </li>
            <li> AND the package came sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> I recommend for beginner wet shavers.</li>
            <li> It has seven packs of blades and is only missing a couple of brands that should be tried.</li>
            <li> I must say I have grown partial to the 7 o&#x27;clocks.</li>
            <li> The product was as expected.</li>
            <li> 2 out of 3 came as expected.</li>
            <li> They were also dropped at round 2, but only because I had tried them before.</li>
            <li> That way, there really is no point in enduring the &amp;#34;tug and pull&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: Within a few hours of posting this comment, I was contacted by the company and not only received an apology, but they are sending the correct blades.</li>
            <li> Double edge blades are one of those items where a product that you love someone else may hate.  </li>
            <li> Minus one star for the bait and switch picture thing and minus one star for not getting what I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d probably recommend these to those with sensitive skin and/or thin facial</li>
            <li> I have a thick beard, corse hair, and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and holds and edge a long time.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re curious, Feather and Shark, both worked extremely well on my razor/skin combination.</li>
            <li> - I thought I would like this blade, but it left my neck feeling raw.  </li>
            <li> Shark - Similar experience to the Astra with an OK (but not super close) first shave, but bad bad irritation/bumps/ingrown hairs with any subsequent shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cannot find double edge blades in my area (small town).</li>
            <li> I find Feather are sharp and hold their edge longer.</li>
            <li> So why all these other brands?  </li>
            <li> Whether this was due to deteriorating product quality with the throw-away razors (or blade cartridges) or just changes in my skin, I don&#x27;t know.  </li>
            <li> of this was due to the weather (which changes the condition of my skin)&lt;br /&gt;and</li>

            <li> This blade is too sharp for shaving against the grain.  </li>

            <li> other words,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so sharp.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other samplers, you get 5 blades of each type not 1 or 2.  </li>
            <li> This product contains razor blades from Russia, Pakistan, Egypt, Japan, and maybe one or two other countries.</li>
            <li> For example, some blades are insanely sharp, and others are just sharp.  </li>
            <li> Some of those razors are really sharp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just throw them in the tool box and use them on other projects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are not as sharp as the Feathers</li>

            <li> majority of the blades are sharp and work without giving me nicks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend trying to find a &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; pack with Feather, Wilkinson Sword, maybe some Blue Personna, Crystal, etc., or just buying small packs a</li>
            <li> /&gt;Feathers - extremely sharp and aggressive...</li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL!</li>
            <li> They are sharp.</li>
            <li> Initially I felt disappointed to have spent so much money on a razor, brush, creams, soaps and so on, but now I would never go back to anything else.</li>
            <li> It does seem apparent everyone&#x27;s experience is different, as I see positive remarks around for blades that I found completely worthless.  </li>
            <li> but I can care less how sharp a blade is if it is unforgiving when shaving.</li>
            <li> The Sharks: I tried really hard to like these blades because they are the only ones that do not come glued* to the wax paper wrappers.  </li>
            <li> The second it is too dull.</li>
            <li> , I had a pretty bad nick on my upper lip.</li>
            <li> Sharks chew up my face, and the others are average.</li>
            <li> After trying each of these at least once, now I have an idea of what different blades feel like and what my preferences are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> example, people are frequently very favorable to the Derby blades, however in my razors, for my face, I found them to pull and be quite uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Some blades you will love, some you will hate.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find out that the sharper the blade, the worse my experience was.</li>
            <li> Be wary of the feather blades in particular - they&#x27;re ultra sharp and don&#x27;t care about your inexperience with blades.  </li>
            <li> After a 3 way battle it came down to Astra, Shark and Feather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Astra was the hands down winner for me.</li>
            <li> So, it comes down to price for me.  </li>
            <li> I apply almost no pressure and let the razor/blade glide down my skin.  </li>
            <li> Shark can be a little to sharp for me</li>
            <li> By the end of the first shave, it started tugging a little and trying it a second shave was bad news bears for my mug.  </li>
            <li> So, maybe Sharks are also very sharp and I just do not like very sharp blades for the way I shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I now shave using the very sharp feather blades.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately they&#x27;re also the most expensive (but still way cheaper than cartridges).  </li>
            <li> I was misinformed that silver and black was discontinued and not platinum coated.  </li>
            <li> Im getting 140 days out of this pack which is slightly less 15 CENTS a day.</li>
            <li> The Feathers were the black and silver pack.</li>
            <li> Helped me narrow down what I wanted in a set of blades.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of trying them all, I&#x27;m down to a 2-way tie between the Astra and the Derby blades, but that&#x27;s just me - YMMV.</li>
            <li> For the price of less than $0.50 per blade, I&#x27;m not going to cry about  few blade I didn&#x27;t shave with.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey, but you have to start somewhere.</li>
            <li> I wrote a little review and assigned a number (4 being the highest) after three shave cycle which compared each blade to the Gillette Platinum.</li>
            <li> You get a little bit of everything.</li>
            <li> The product came as advertised and came in a few days.</li>
            <li> an 7O&#x27;clock green.</li>
            <li> After using a couple blades, I was sold and bought a bulk pack which I use as my everyday blade now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I think I am a bit too heavy handed a shaver to use these blades.  </li>
            <li> Package was as described; however, I found a couple of hairs stuck to the pkg tape.. kind of disgusting..</li>
            <li> Just felt like I wasted money</li>
            <li> I usually get slight irritation on my neck.  </li>
            <li> So each blade I tried at least 3 separate times, and I wrote down what I thought of each blade after I used it.</li>
            <li> These were, by far, the absolute worst blades I tried.</li>
            <li> What I discovered is that the difference between brands is small compared to the difference in materials types.</li>
            <li> Not sure why.  </li>
            <li> others have said, give each brand at least a few blades before you give up on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are not memorable and I have nothing to say about them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could only use the gillettes twice before I would get irritation, so you can imagine how expensive buying refill cartridges got.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;d have done without that pack</li>
            <li> usually get</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: After using my safety razor for the past month or so, I have mastered the technique.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if that would effect their sharpness or not,</li>
            <li> If you feel like razor shaving is not for you, you are just wrong, because you haven&#x27;t tried enough of blades to find the one for you.</li>
            <li> but these two blades will shave everything a lady cares to remove in one shot without getting dull.</li>
            <li> If I had to choose between shaving with Shark blades or a dull rock, I wouldn&#x27;t shave with either.</li>
            <li> I think I pushed a bit too hard.  </li>
            <li> but at least I know that that&#x27;s the type of razor I need to be using.</li>
            <li> recommendation is to pick any blade, and try to get at least 2 shaves from it before switching to another blade.  </li>
            <li> At least that was my experience.</li>
            <li> to least favorite:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> Hated the Shark, but the rest are well worth using till the end of the 5 packs.</li>
            <li> Not a good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Astra&#x27;s are also no good for me</li>
            <li> A negative rating based on individual blade dissatisfaction would be irrelevant and unfair to the seller, which I see some have failed to understand...</li>
            <li> will rate these from worst to first, here goes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Utter crap.  </li>
            <li> I did not get a decent shave and I suffered terribly from a lot of &amp;#34;tug and pull&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> These are the worst for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> By far the worst shave of them all.</li>
            <li> but was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> After 12-15 shaves (lost count) i found my bluebird looked scary even though the shave was still acceptable...</li>
            <li> They made an expensive addition to my trashcan.</li>
            <li> Shaving the difficult areas on my face can be trying.</li>
            <li> If you are exploring the idea of switching from an electric razor or the (way, way too) expensive cartridges and going with a safety razor, this is a no-brainer purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If this is what you want there is nothing wrong with the blades.</li>
            <li> this point, I don&#x27;t ever feel any razor burn after I have rinsed my face in cold water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been afraid of the super-sharp blades until now.  </li>
            <li> For fear of bumps, I still am afraid to try and shave against the grain.</li>
            <li> if unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> That is a lot of blades to hate if you get the wrong ones.  </li>
            <li> They cut and nicked my face badly.  </li>
            <li> I understand, though, that those three are routinely preferred to run-of-the-mill Derby and the unquestionably bad Astra.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it was inexperience as I was learning, but I can&#x27;t forget the bad</li>
            <li> If I get a bad nick again, I am tossing them too.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too bad I got screwed on the Bluebirds.</li>
            <li> But using them was a painful experience.  </li>
            <li> I hated these blades for tugging at my beard, until I learned to vary the cutting angle according to whisker length &amp; cutting direction.  </li>
            <li> I had no nicks or cuts at all, so don&#x27;t be afraid!</li>
            <li> I had no nicks or cuts at all, so don´t be afraid!</li>
            <li> Crap.  </li>
            <li> but they gave me THE WORST case of bumps and painful irritation</li>
            <li> I HATED the derby.</li>
            <li> Electric razors cause ingrown hairs and razor bumps &amp; disposables give me terrible razor</li>
            <li> these are terrible!</li>
            <li> Sharks are the worst blades ever produced in the history of mankind.</li>
            <li> All others, schick, Bic and the rest of the disposals on the market were just devastating to my neck and the nape of my head.</li>
            <li> Gillette silver the worst.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Bought when I first switched to using a double edged razor to shave.  Good way to find what blades work with your razor and skin.  For me it was the Astra blades, but the 7 oclock were also good blades in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Great variety pack to know what brands are available to a novice shaver.</li>
            <li> I am not going to say that this is the best sampler pack, but this was the best sampler pack for me. Sampler packs in general are ingenius tools at the wetshaver&#x27;s disposal, since the whole point is to find the best razor blade for your face/gear combination. If you have tried DE (double edge) before and were disappointed or discouraged, I would suggest trying one of these sampler packs and seeing if another blade won&#x27;t work better for you.&lt;br /&gt;This particular sampler was perfect for me, because I wanted to try Derby, Feather, Astra and Gillette. Do some research, find a few blades that theoretically work for you, and then try to find a sampler that has most/all of the blades you want to try.&lt;br /&gt;Another good point about this particular sampler is the range of aggressiveness that you have here. Derby is considered by many as a rather mild blade. Feather is a very aggressive blade (many say the sharpest on the market), Astra falls kinda in the middle. So with this pack, you get a nice spectrum of aggressiveness.</li>
            <li> I am new to shaving with a DE razor and this kit was great to test drive different types of razors. What I discovered is that the difference between brands is small compared to the difference in materials types. Platinum blades, for instances, feels like a cheese grater against my skin. Stainless steel, for my skin type, feels WAY better by far. I&#x27;m sure different brands of stainless steel razors will work differently but at least I know that that&#x27;s the type of razor I need to be using. Very Useful!</li>
            <li> When I ordered these were listed as 100 blades. Only 35, five each of seven brands. Still recommend buying these. Allows you try a few different brands/origins and find the blade you like best. For me the platinum coated German blades were best, the Russian Gillette and Astra were close seconds. I ended up ordering a large pack of Merkur when I was done with these. Probably will order Astra next time because they are so cheap. Be sure to use nice shaving cream/lotion like Shiseido.</li>
            <li> This is the best way to get into DE shaving.  Purchasing a full box of blades without knowing if they will &amp;#34;match&amp;#34; your face is a risky and possibly damaging move.  Kit&#x27;s like these allow you to test which blade type works well with your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this is your first attempt at DE shaving, leave the Feathers for last. They are amazingly sharp blades and require you to know what you are doing, otherwise you can really cut yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation is to pick any blade, and try to get at least 2 shaves from it before switching to another blade.  My progression took me through four of the seven options, until I  found the right one for me.  After about 6 weeks shaving I tried the fifth pack (Feathers), and loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off one star because the only thing that would have made this kit perfect is if  it included the Personna Lab Blue blades.  I think then it would have truly covered all the major brands of blades; and for me, my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are quite pricey for only 35 blades ($18.50 when I bought them) but a very good way to see what suits your needs and face..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more note, don&#x27;t buy the one blade sample packs, as you need to try them more than once to really appreciate if they work or not...especially fi you are new to DE as your technique will improve and so will the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend starting this way, and then figuring out what you want to use going forward.</li>
            <li> Excellent way to get a great assortment of blades. Cannot find double edge blades in my area (small town). These are great.</li>
            <li> I have not tried all the brands yet but those that I have, I liked, I have used the derby,astra and feather, I&#x27;ll try the others soon.The product came as advertised and came in a few days.</li>
            <li> Double edge blades are one of those items where a product that you love someone else may hate.  There are too many variations in hair and skin types to declare a single blade better than others for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, this sampler pack helped me zero in on my favorite, which was the Feathers.</li>
            <li> Without having bought this sample set, I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to find my blades.</li>
            <li> Great way to sample several brands. I find Feather are sharp and hold their edge longer. The Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock blades start sharper but don&#x27;t hold their edge as long. Sharks chew up my face, and the others are average.</li>
            <li> Good assortment.  Great way for a new DE user to try a variety of blades.</li>
            <li> Picking the blade that is right for you is such a pain.  I&#x27;m glad the offer sample packs like this.  I just got into wet shaving, and most places have a minimum of 25 blades.  That is a lot of blades to hate if you get the wrong ones.  Out of the set, the Derby are the most forgiving, although I get razor bumps from them.  Not sure why.  The Feather and Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock are my favorites.  The rest of them were acceptable.</li>
            <li> So far so good they don&#x27;t last as long as the sample but cheap for the price</li>
            <li> I grew up DE shaving, switched to disposable, then to electric, and came back to DE last year. I have been trying different samples of blades and now have settled with this one. Now I use Mekur long handle, Feather blades, and Proraso pre-shave and soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pack has the top 3 of my favorite and the best of the blades available in the market. I started with a 25 pack sampler, then tried this sampler, before I decided on Feather, with Astra being the second. Those who are looking for blades for DE shaving should start with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the ones that I have tried, this is the order that worked for me:&lt;br /&gt;Feather, Astra, Bluebird, Gillette, Supermax, Bic, ..... Shark, Nacet, Derby, Lord, etc.</li>
            <li> Helped me to test out the different blades and I was able to find the kind that works best for me. Thankfully I was able to find one that I liked. Astra Superior Premium blade was the best for me. Some of the other brands got dull too quickly and caused nics and razor burn.</li>
            <li> A nice set of double edge (DE) blades to try out if you want to sample blades for your razor. This nice collection of blades should help you find the right blade for your type of shaving needs. I recommend it to anyone like me, who is a &amp;#34;newby&amp;#34; to DE shaving.</li>
            <li> I received exactly what was promised in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> Bought these to go with a new razor to test out different brands of blades.  I&#x27;ve tried from 2 packs so far and have been please with the results from both.  Going to keep trying new ones until I find a favorite but I expect these to last awhile.</li>
            <li> This is a must buy for everyone because it has the entire spectrum of blades. Safety razor blades are not a product where sharper means better.  If that was the case everyone would buy feather and that would be that.  The best blades are cheap enough to use by anyone.  So why all these other brands?  Well because for me the best shave came from blades that where not platinum lubricated and where not known as the sharper blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bluebird, shark, and one of the others worked best and not on the first 2 shaves.  I found the first 2 shaves to be harsh but not as harsh as a feather.  Also they keep their mild sharpness longer than feather. After 4-5 shaves I found myself tossing the feather.  After 12-15 shaves (lost count) i found my bluebird looked scary even though the shave was still acceptable... I wasnt looking forward to the new blade and its first 2 rough shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, my opinion is to many people jump to feather because it is the hands down sharpest blade... Its just not the best blade for shaving (at least not for everyone)!</li>
            <li> The 7 o&#x27;clock blades were ok for my beard, however the rest were like shaving with a cheese grater.  They cut and nicked my face badly.  They made an expensive addition to my trashcan.</li>
            <li> So I made the jump to wet shavng with a DE saftey razor and all the forums and advice columns suggested ordering a sampler pack to find a match to my type face. This sampler pack fits the bill perfectly. It has a selction of the more popular blades out there. Can&#x27;t wait to try them all.</li>
            <li> a great sampling of blades</li>
            <li> After 30+ years of using twin (and more) blade disposables, I was getting too many ingrown whiskers.  Whether this was due to deteriorating product quality with the throw-away razors (or blade cartridges) or just changes in my skin, I don&#x27;t know.  But I tried several of the throw-aways and nothing helped.  So back to the old technology double-edge razor I went - and I&#x27;m glad I did (although I did have to clean up my shaving technique, because this style razor gives you less margin for error).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sampler is a great way to test drive a bunch of different blades.  Every guy is different, so what worked for me may or may not work for you.  But certainly you will see a difference in products, so there&#x27;s no sense in buying a whole lot of one type of blade just to find out you don&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try each type for several shaves, as the first time after you switch might not be representative of how it will work on a continuous basis.  At least that was my experience.</li>
            <li> At $0.48 ea this is a great sampler pack, that I have now purchased twice.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s face is different and the ONLY way to find out what works best for you is to try them all out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...I have a dark red beard peppered with bigger thicker dark whiskers which are wide and flat instead of round.&lt;br /&gt;My beard is particularly curly, and grows right alongside my skin--so I am prone to having ingrown hairs.  Also, the grain of my beard spirals and changes directions in several places.&lt;br /&gt;...Electric razors cause ingrown hairs and razor bumps &amp; disposables give me terrible razor rash.&lt;br /&gt;...Since I have switched to DE razors, I can shave every day (for the first time since I was in my teens) and my skin no longer burns when I sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time around I used each blade for one week, and switched brands frequently.&lt;br /&gt;Oddly enough, my preferred make changed several times.&lt;br /&gt;Some of this was due to the weather (which changes the condition of my skin)&lt;br /&gt;and some of this (I hope) was due to technique changes.&lt;br /&gt;The second time around I decided to use one brand at a time and learn to adapt my technique to the blade.&lt;br /&gt;The end result is that I can now shave with every blade comfortably, though some are markedly better than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...($0.40 ea) The [[ASIN:B0022R947O Feathers]] were my first favorite.  They are sharp and do not tug at any shaving angle.  This blade is too sharp for shaving against the grain.  Shaving the difficult areas on my face can be trying. This is my preferred blade for shaving a full beard. (New [[ASIN:B0084NQJUA link]] for $0.30 ea)&lt;br /&gt;...($0.14 ea) The [[ASIN:B002DZ0N5W Blue Birds]] are my current favorite.  They are nearly as sharp as the feathers (no tugging).  They also are too sharp to attempt against the grain shaving.  They are gentler on my skin than the feathers and allow for more passes with less razor burn (good for addressing those difficult areas).  (Edit: For some reason the secondtuck of these didn&#x27;t impress me... )&lt;br /&gt;...($0.08 ea) The [[ASIN:B004SGKMA0 Derbys]] are sure to remain in my arsenal.  I hated these blades for tugging at my beard, until I learned to vary the cutting angle according to whisker length &amp; cutting direction.  Indeed, I now get the gentlest shaves from this blade, and they are inexpensive to boot!&lt;br /&gt;...($0.10 ea) The [[ASIN:B001QY8QXM Astras]] were the first blade I ran out of.  They are a dirt cheap, versatile blade (plenty sharp and reasonably gentle), but they didn&#x27;t last very long.&lt;br /&gt;...($0.25 ea) The Gillette Platinums on are good blades that seem to last forever... as is reflected in their price.  If I could only have one blade this might very well be it.&lt;br /&gt;...($0.25 ea) The [[ASIN:B00875XSIQ Gillette Stainless]] didn&#x27;t seem to be as nice as the Platinums.  I would rather have tried the [[ASIN:B006KXD2GU Gillette SharpEdges]].&lt;br /&gt;...($0.16) The Sharks: I tried really hard to like these blades because they are the only ones that do not come glued* to the wax paper wrappers.  However, they don&#x27;t perform with my face/razor very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*for better results with glued blades, insert the blade with the glue spots facing the handle.&lt;br /&gt;PS. I use these in a Merkur HD with Van Der Hagen Deluxe or Col Conk Almond Shave Soap.&lt;br /&gt;PPS. To get a better feel for your shave quality apply aftershave before rinsing with cold water (as well as after).&lt;br /&gt;At this point, I don&#x27;t ever feel any razor burn after I have rinsed my face in cold water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also discovered that a 2-pass shave morning and nightly is better than one 3-pass shave every morning (closer shaves and less irritation).</li>
            <li> Very nice selection of the top blades on the market - essential for finding the one blade &#x27;Right&#x27; for you !</li>
            <li> This is a great selection of blades for the price. Each blade comes in an individual 5 count container. All blades are popular commercial brands with varying qualities. Great for the new DE shavers looking for the right blade.</li>
            <li> Excellent set of high quality blades.  I subsequently bought other blades to sample, but this sampler was the best.  I liked all these blades except the Feather, which was too aggressive for me.  The other 6 brands in this group now constitute my go-to brands.  I would bet that any shaver will find his/her favorite brand by getting this sampler pack.</li>
            <li> Good way totry out different brands.</li>
            <li> Good for star testing</li>
            <li> if you want to try several different quality blades to find what you like, this works well. Most of them do well, with the Feather and the Astra being my favorites (also got some Kroger blades at the same time, and i&#x27;m amazed that they do just as well as most of these).</li>
            <li> I like that a variety of the different blades that are in this sampler, so that you can try different styles and types of blades for not a lot of money .  You can decide what kind of blade you like instead of being stuck with a lot of blades that you might not like if you were forced just buying one type.</li>
            <li> Definitely some choices, not sure if I notice the difference or not, but it&#x27;s a great deal for a lot of razors!!!</li>
            <li> I have not tried all of the blades in this set but i am glad i got it. After trying one blade compared to the merkur that came with my razor i truly understand that different blades work differently for different faces. Can&#x27;t wait to work my way through them all so i can settle on my favorite to buy in quantity later.</li>
            <li> Good place to start to find the right blade.</li>
            <li> I purchased this sample pack along with my first safety razor and was pleasantly surprised at the variability between brands. I was at first skeptical that each brand of blade would have a distinctive feel, after all they are simple double-edged blades. How different could they be? The answer is quite different, and each brand had a distinctive feel on my face. Each person&#x27;s facial hair is distinct in its coarseness and thickness, and different blades respond uniquely. I am so happy that I decided to purchase this sample pack before I committed to buying a single brand in bulk. Had I not, I might have been turned off to wet-shaving very quickly as the blade that came with my safety razor was quite uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Awesome selection of blades at a reasonable price. I bought this pack because even though I&#x27;ve dabbled in wet shaving on and off over the years, I never took the plunge for a sample pack. I&#x27;d always just bought a pack of feathers because that&#x27;s what everyone said were the best. Well for me, they are not the best. I know that thanks to this pack. I&#x27;m much better off with an Astra, or Gillette blade. Haven&#x27;t tried all of them yet but so far I&#x27;m really liking them all (except the feathers). The best thing is that this pack will probably last me a year there are so many blades in it!</li>
            <li> These are excellent razor blades. If you are just getting into the &amp;#34;Art of Wet Shaving&amp;#34; You can not beat the price and it gives a good variety of Razor Blades to choose from. Great product for a beginner.</li>
            <li> some of the best blades from all over the world. Found that the Astra and Feather blades are the sharpest by far.</li>
            <li> As each razor, skin, and beard hair is different, it is really hard to figure out based on other people&#x27;s reviews which blade is going to give you a great comfortable shave with ease.  This pack has some great blades and enough variety to figure out which one is going to be the best compromise between comfort and ability to take off the hair.  I had heard the feathers were the best, but so far for me, the 2 gillette&#x27;s (especially the dark blue platinum plus) gave the best results with least irritation.  As always YMMV....</li>
            <li> The included blades are grey market imports from the Middle East. I don&#x27;t think this affects the product quality, but I wish this were listed in the item description.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how different each brand feels.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting there to be that much of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have said, give each brand at least a few blades before you give up on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally the Astra and and the Feathers have been my favorite.</li>
            <li> Everyone on the forums recommends buying a sampler pack after you&#x27;ve had some practice getting used to DE shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these blades exactly as pictured. I&#x27;ve been through and used each of the blades in this sampler now and can say there is a good variety of blades here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your face is different than mine, and you&#x27;ll have different results, but here is my initial rank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Favorite to least favorite:&lt;br /&gt;1. Gillette Silver Blue&lt;br /&gt;2. Astra&lt;br /&gt;3. Feather&lt;br /&gt;4. Shark&lt;br /&gt;5. Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock&lt;br /&gt;6. Bluebird&lt;br /&gt;7. Derby&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on doing more testing to figure out which is my favorite, but I know for myself personally, 5-7 I do not like. They were harsher than 1-4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try this pack for yourself and you&#x27;ll more than likely find a blade that works well for you.</li>
            <li> This pack is essential when getting started with double edge razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a very good selection of varying sharpness and types of razors and allows you to select the best for your particular use.</li>
            <li> I am new to safety razor shaving. I have the Edwin Jagger longhandle. I really enjoy trying different brands of razors and this did the trick. So far Feather and Bluebird have it. Would have been nice if some Merkur and Personna samples were included.</li>
            <li> Nice, selection of blades from the sharpest to the more mild. I&#x27;ve found Feather and Blue Birds to be my preferred blades so far as they are the sharpest of the bunch. They both have given the best and closest shaves. I&#x27;ve used the rest to varying results with the 7 o&#x27;clock and Derby being far to mild for my liking. I should state I never use a blade for more than 3 shaves so I cannot speak on the longevity of any blade.</li>
            <li> Get sample set.  I did not expect to like the Sharks as much as I did and I did not find the Feather to be as good for my shave as others have.  The Derby&#x27;s are fantastic.  Now I know what works for me.  This was a great investment</li>
            <li> I am new to DE shaving and want to find the cheapest, best blades for my shave. This sampler had most of the blades I wanted to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I did receive a slightly different package of Feather blades than the picture indicates. The picture shows the yellow package New Hi-Stainless, and the ones I received were the black/silver packaging reading Feather Hi-Stainless Double Edge.</li>
            <li> I know that the right blade depends on different beard types and facial structures, but I wanted to rate the blades in case it could help others:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1 - Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock: Best overall in terms of sharpness, durability, and effectiveness. This will be my blade from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#2 - Gillette Silver Blue: Close to the 7 O&#x27;Clock blades, but didn&#x27;t think they held their sharpness for as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#3 - Feather: Sharpest blade of the bunch, but too sharp for me as I have to shave against the grain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#4 - Astra: Was comfortable, but not as sharp as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#5 - Blue Bird: Not bad on first shave, but tugged after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#6 - Shark: Good for only one shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#7 - Derby: Would not recommend at all. Caused irritation on first shave, only used twice and then threw all the blades away.</li>
            <li> This is a good representation of some of the variety of safety razor blades on the market.  I have tried most of them thus far.  Some work better than others based on my beard type and the razor.  This has helped me get a better understanding of the blade that works best for me.</li>
            <li> Got all the blades as described. Great deal! Excited to see which blade I like for shaving best. Feathers will be last, since I heard they are the sharpest and only used for advanced shavers.</li>
            <li> Purchased this sampler when I decided to switch from the cartridge ripoff scam and begin REAL shaving with a DE razor.  The advice you get on many message boards is correct:  buy a sampler pack and try different blades to find what works best for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four of the brands in this sampler are good and gave me close, comfortable shaves.  The Astra&#x27;s were the best, followed by the Gillette Silver Blues and Feathers, with the Bluebirds performing well but not as good as the Astra&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Derby&#x27;s came with my Edwin Jagger razor, and while they&#x27;re ok they do not shave as well as the ones mentioned above.  The 7O&#x27;Clock greens and the Sharks were not comfortable for me, and I have some left which I&#x27;ll probably never use (on my face at least).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good sampler pack that helped me find my favorite blade (Astra) and introduced me to how well the Feather, Silver Blue and Bluebird shave as well.</li>
            <li> This is a good starter set t get you going. Check on line for wet shaving forums to learn more.</li>
            <li> This sample set really helped me figure out what blades to buy for my safety razor.  After trying all of the blades, you can really tell the difference in the way the blades are made.  Now I know I&#x27;m getting the right blade for my face.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to see what blades work best with your face. Everyone&#x27;s face is different so trying different ones is essential. I am very pleased with this multipack and will be sharing it with friends now that i have found my match!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re switching to Double Edge (DE) wet shaving, you have to try a lot of different blades when you start out. If you don&#x27;t, you will end up turning away from what would otherwise be a radical improvement in your shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other words, if you don&#x27;t like DE wet shaving, it&#x27;s not DE, it&#x27;s your blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should buy a sampler kit, and among the ones available on Amazon, this is quite a good one. The included Gillette, Shark, and Feather blades were the best for me. Everyone&#x27;s skin and the amount of pressure they apply while shaving is different, so there&#x27;s no one size fits all \\&quot;best\\&quot; blade. I understand, though, that those three are routinely preferred to run-of-the-mill Derby and the unquestionably bad Astra. The inclusion of those two is the only reason I give this 4 stars, not 5. Instead, I would have preferred Bic or Lord blades to be included.</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;m going to give a bad review because I fell in love with the Astra and Feather blades almost instantly.  I haven&#x27;t even tried the Derby, Gilette, or Shark blades yet.  I might not ever.  I love the feel of the Feather blade.  It&#x27;s so sharp.  I started DE shaving back in March so I&#x27;m just a newbie to this.  The Astra seemed to cut me and leave razor burn but it may have been my technique at the time.  Feather gives me the smoothest single pass shave imaginable.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to wet shaving with safety razors and I recommend you do this, then start with this sampler set. It gives you a nice start for testing out various blade options so you can see what works best for you.  Every face is different and will get different results with various blades.  There are also a lot of blades here so this will take you a while to go through.  All of the blades seem good to me and I have found my favorites out of this sampler so it does the trick.</li>
            <li> this was bought for my son-in-law and he did a lot of research before having me order it, he is very pleased with it</li>
            <li> I have stopped paying for the extortionate Fusion brand and gone to a DE razor shaving regime.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this pack to help decide which blades I like, The Gillette Blue And Astra are my favorites so far.</li>
            <li> This is a good sample pack I am still working on which ones I like the best.  Its a smart choice to go with something like this when you&#x27;re new to shaving with a safety razor.</li>
            <li> Well worth trying these out before you settle on one razor blade.</li>
            <li> For the price, this blade sampler pack is a steal. 35 blades, including Feather and Shark, is great for someone looking to get into wet shaving. I chose this pack over the 32 pack sampler, which includes 16 different blade brands, because I preferred to have more blades of the brand that worked, instead of trying them all and only having two blades of my preferred brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging was simple and unobtrusive, and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the blades themselves, other than the anticipated blade incompatibility with my facial hair and razor type. The Sharks are my go-to blade, with the Feather, Derby, and Astra brands coming in right after. I couldn&#x27;t get used to the harshness of the Gillette or Blue Bird, but that&#x27;s not the seller&#x27;s responsibility.</li>
            <li> I recently switched to a safety razor in an effort to save some money on those rediculously expensive razor cartridges and during my research phase I found that there is not one perfect blade that you should buy.  You have to try several and see which one works the best for you!  This sampler pack gives you an assortment of blades to try for a very good price, I&#x27;d highly recommend it to anyone looking to find the right safety razor blade for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: the Feather and Blue Bird are my personal favorites so far.  I am a woman so I can&#x27;t attest to their beard busting capability but these two blades will shave everything a lady cares to remove in one shot without getting dull.</li>
            <li> As described. Great way to try different brands. 5 blades is enough to get a good feel of them, I find</li>
            <li> One of the best ways to find the straight razor that works for you</li>
            <li> Great purchase with new razor. Allowed me to determine which blades worked best with my new razor. Amount of blades provided in each sample was appropriate for testing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good survey of available blades - some I liked and some I didn&#x27;t - and that&#x27;s the point. I prefer the Feather blades myself but it&#x27;s a personal preference and this kit will allow you to find one you like (unless you&#x27;re unusually picky.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase. I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars because I just got it and have only used 3 types of blades but I&#x27;m sure if I had tried all of them already I would give it a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try some different blades out, because it&#x27;s clear that people have strong preferences one way or the other.  My razor came with Derby blades, so that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve used. I wanted to see if something else would suit me better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the selection here.  Reading hundreds of reviews for specific blades, and many more from the various samplers out there, I ended up selecting this sampler because it looked like it had the highest percentage of recognizable brands without including a lot of no-name brands that no one seems to like or care about.  After all of this reading of reviews, I was most interested in trying Feather, Astra, Shark, and Bluebird. All of those are included, plus two types of Gillette and a Derby pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll pay more though. For the price of the sampler you can buy a 100-pack of just about any of these. And if you don&#x27;t care for some of these, you&#x27;ve wasted your money by paying more for them and having them sit forever in your drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line?  If you like the blades you have, just keep them.  For the price of this sampler you can get a 100-pack of your current favorites and have blades until the end of time. I feel like I may have noticed minor differences between them, but nothing has made me say, &amp;#34;Oh these are terrible! They feel like I&#x27;m shaving with a squeegee! I&#x27;m never shaving with them again.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This was a great sample starter kit for a new found hobby that I hope to master soon. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have been working my way through each brand to find my go-to blade.  This selection is very, very good.</li>
            <li> i wish i would have heard of this safety razor business earlier, it saves so much money time and effort having everything i need right there in my little shaving box/tub. i dont have to spend 20 bucks on a set of  4 popular triple blade razors only to have to buy them again the next month. these get a close shave i dont get cut up they last a couple of shaves and with this bundle you get enough to last for the next year maybe two! its just a great deal</li>
            <li> This is a decent sampler pack and has a few good blade choices, but I believe it is overpriced. $21 for 35 blades is pretty steep, especially considering I only found a couple of choices that worked for me.</li>
            <li> Product received  as described.</li>
            <li> Pretty solid sample set and good introduction to DE shaving.  Be wary of the feather blades in particular - they&#x27;re ultra sharp and don&#x27;t care about your inexperience with blades.  I ended up settling on the astra blades, but it seems that it&#x27;s all up to preference and how well the blade matches your chosen razor.</li>
            <li> I loved having the selection. I think I am going with the Astra or the Feathers next time. I HATED the derby. It felt like it was ripping the hairs outta my face LOL.</li>
            <li> Great for a beginning DE Safety razor user. Some blades you will love, some you will hate. I like the fact that I got five of each type of blade. I did not like the Derbys the first time I used them but now that I know what I&#x27;m doing I think they are amazing. Great value and amazing for training and finding what you like BEFORE you buy 100 of something.</li>
            <li> This sampler is a good bet to find out which blade is good for you.  Unlike other samplers, you get 5 blades of each type not 1 or 2.  This is important because as your DE technique improves you may find (like I did) that a blade you had initially not liked is actually a favorite.  Having 5 of each allows you to revisit those blades once you are more comfortable with the DE razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t review each one since the choice of blade is a very personal one and everyone&#x27;s skin is unique but I think you&#x27;ll be satified with this sampler which includes a selection of commonly found, good quality blades.</li>
            <li> Shark and Derby so-so, Gillette blades made in Russia better.</li>
            <li> This product contains razor blades from Russia, Pakistan, Egypt, Japan, and maybe one or two other countries. Each manufacturer&#x27;s blades perform differently.  For example, some blades are insanely sharp, and others are just sharp.  Use this package to get a feel for what type of blade is compatible with your beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I&#x27;d recommend is it come with a pack of bandages.  Some of those razors are really sharp.</li>
            <li> Bought this pack after a little research on trying different blades to find the right one for my face. And I will say different blades are &amp;#34;different&amp;#34; for your face. However there is truth that the best blade for me may not be your best blade so please take this review with a grain of salt and try them for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will rate these from worst to first, here goes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worst- Shark blades; for me these were the most uncortable. I instantly felt a lot of pulling on my neck area and after done shaving I had some irritation in that area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Blue Bird; Not much to say about these other than they were slightly more comfortable than the Sharks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Feather; I know many here love these but I can care less how sharp a blade is if it is unforgiving when shaving. And if your realy not carefull you will have much irritation afterwards. Sharp yes, comfortable no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Gillette 7&#x27;o clocks; Pretty darn good blade for comfort and very forgiving but could be a tad bit sharper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Astra; Good in both the comfort and sharpness category but not good enough to be my go to blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Derby; Yes Derby at #2, This blade is very comfortable and gives a great shave. The only knock I have on it is that it tends to start losing its sharpness after day three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Gillette Silver Blue; Hands down from the first time I tried this blade I knew I had just shaved with my go to blade of the future. I almost stopped trying the others at this point. Close, comfortable, sharp and the blades last a full week with no signs of losing any performance. Bottom line is I just bought a 100 pack of these.</li>
            <li> great variety helped me decide with confidence</li>
            <li> Great razor blade sampler. A little pricey, but you have to start somewhere.</li>
            <li> All blades in this pack are awesomr</li>
            <li> Helped me narrow down what I wanted in a set of blades. Pretty sure I&#x27;m settling on the Astra SP, if anyone was wondering</li>
            <li> Great way to sample different brands before buying in bulk. A bit more expensive this way, but worth it to learn which blade works best for you. For example, I almost bought a bulk pack of Shark blades because I had used and liked them a few years ago. With this sampler, I learned that they changed their manufacturing process and they no longer work well for me. I&#x27;ll be able to try and switch to a different brand.</li>
            <li> This is a great sample pack for those jumping into the world of shaving with a Safety Razor.  It has a good selection of some popular blades from across the spectrum.  Comes with five of each, which is good when you find a few brands you like and you are working through your finalists.  Not so good when you come across a blade that you immediately dislike after one shave.  I can&#x27;t blame the sampler for that, it&#x27;s the nature of the beast when you are getting into shaving with a Safety / DE razor. For the price of less than $0.50 per blade, I&#x27;m not going to cry about  few blade I didn&#x27;t shave with.  I&#x27;ll just throw them in the tool box and use them on other projects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the seven brands in this sampler, I found two I really liked, a few that were decent and useable and a few that I will never use again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day I found the blades that me and my face like by purchasing this sampler.</li>
            <li> I bought this sampler to find what blade I would find most comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Feathers are easily the sharpest blade and most expensive. They do not retain their sharpness long with course hair and also easily cut the skin. They are not a forgiving blade. Not a good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Astras and Derbys are equally the longest lasting and best value. They are not as sharp as the Feathers but you can get just as close of a shave. They are also reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bluebirds are comparable to the Gillettes. They are not memorable and I have nothing to say about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sharks are the worst blades ever produced in the history of mankind. They are not sharp and they cut off your face. If I had to choose between shaving with Shark blades or a dull rock, I wouldn&#x27;t shave with either.</li>
            <li> Just as advertised. The package arrived quickly.  Though the feather blades you receive might come in a black package, the blades are the same as those in the yellow package, even though one says \\&quot;platinum\\&quot; and the other doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Great choices.  I used these all before I decided which to purchase.  Many choices and many prices.  After a 3 way battle it came down to Astra, Shark and Feather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ultimately chose Astra.  Feather was nice but not twice the price nice.</li>
            <li> If you are exploring the idea of switching from an electric razor or the (way, way too) expensive cartridges and going with a safety razor, this is a no-brainer purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Believe it or not, the blade makes a difference.  Quite honestly, I don&#x27;t know why.  They all appear to be the exact same size and shape (which makes sense since they&#x27;re all designed to be used in the same application), they all feel like they&#x27;re the exact same thickness, and they&#x27;re all sharp as ... well.. razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I found that some of the blades were really rough on my face (the Gillette and Shark blades), others didn&#x27;t shave as closely (Astra and Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock) and the blade I like best is the Feather blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I learned, though, is you can&#x27;t go by what people are saying in forums.  Everyone gives their personal opinion (almost fanatically, in some cases), and your experience will be your own; not theirs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this and try out the different blades.  You&#x27;ll be surprised at the differences.</li>
            <li> Have been using these 5 at a time since receiving them and have 10 blades left (Astra and Feather).  The set has done exactly what I wanted and allowed me to try multiple blades over time to find one I like.  From the 5 I have tried, I know there are some I dislike and some I am neutral about.  I have a feeling that in the end I will end up using the Astra blades as they are cheap and I tried 5 of them previously with my handle purchase and cannot see spending the extra money for other blades.  We shall see after trying the Feather&#x27;s next but with a fresh edge each day, I think I will ultimately go for the value.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you are just starting to shave this way that you try packs like this. I now know that I love the gillette blades, thought the astra and the shark blades are ok, and I wouldn&#x27;t buy the other three. You may have another opinion. Give it a try!</li>
            <li> Still working my way through them, but really surprised at the difference.  Feather is my favorite so far.  I found it early and have some reluctance to keep trying.  I wish I had got the sampler of single blades rather than 5 packs because now I have several I don&#x27;t care to use.</li>
            <li> I have gone through 6 of the 7 types of blades and was surprised at the difference in feel between each blade.  This was a good intro into the variety that is out there for DE razors</li>
            <li> It was fun to take a tour of the world with my face each morning.  The thrill of that alone is worth trying a sampler pack.  After trying each of these at least once, now I have an idea of what different blades feel like and what my preferences are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 2nd favorite was the Shark.  My favorite was the Feather.  I was hoping for better from the Bluebird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I like the Feather:  Clearly it&#x27;s by far the sharpest.  This morning I put in a new blade and started to shave.  I didn&#x27;t feel anything, so I literally checked to see if there was a blade in the razor.  Yes there was!  Wow, no pulling at all!  Completely comfortable.  I&#x27;ve been afraid of the super-sharp blades until now.  In a way, I think they are safer.  They nick skin, but it doesn&#x27;t cut as deeply.  With the less sharp blades it&#x27;s easy to make a nick and have it gush blood for a long time.  The Feather blades have shallower nicks, so it stops bleeding almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shark and feather are the same in almost every way except for one thing.  After I shave, there is always a buildup of tiny hair and shaving cream on the blade that I wash off each time.  For some reason the feather blades don&#x27;t have this problem as much.  The buildup doesn&#x27;t happen nearly as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, what do you do with the old blades when you are finished with them?  The feather package comes with a safe disposal container.  Some of the cheaper blades do not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I clearly know what I like, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be purchasing this product again for myself, but I do plan on giving a safety razor set as a gift to a friend, and I&#x27;ll be sure to include this package.</li>
            <li> Ignore every recommendation and review you have read about blades. I listened to others and ended up almost giving up on wet shaving altogether. Each person has a different beard and different skin so they will have different results with each blade. It makes a big difference, trust me. A pack like this can help you find the right fit for you.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great way to test blades to find out what works best for you. I was surprised to find out that the sharper the blade, the worse my experience was. Everyone lauded the greatness of Feather blades but no matter how gently I shaved, I always got razor burn. Surprisingly, the &amp;#34;duller&amp;#34; blades such as Astra and Derby give me the best shaves and feel nice and smooth. Derby is the clear winner for me. I wouldn&#x27;t have found all this out without a sample pack like this to test many different brands.</li>
            <li> This is a good sampler pack of blades. It provides some interesting variety.</li>
            <li> Great samplings of blades from around the world.  Also, gives a person a chance to try the dfferent blades for a good price to find the one that works best for his beard and face.</li>
            <li> I received all the blades shown (Gillette, Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock, feather, Astra, Blue, Shark and Derby). one of the boxes of blades seemed to be open slightly, but I think the adhesive just didn&#x27;t survive shipping. Great way to test blades more than once, and now my wife and I can try different blades for our DE shavers with out having to compromise on who gets what. Must have for anyone starting out with a DE shaver. I was skeptic about the whole &amp;#34;Not all blades are the same&amp;#34; thing, but yeah, I guess it&#x27;s really true. The Derby cuts my face something harsh, but the Shark is smooth against my skin and no irritation. Shaving should be fun, and not dreaded, and this helps you get excited for new blades!</li>
            <li> So I bought the variety pack, and tried them all!  I&#x27;m glad I did as most of these blades were terrible on my&lt;br /&gt;face. So each blade I tried at least 3 separate times, and I wrote down what I thought of each blade after I used it. Astra was the hands down winner for me. So, then i bought a pack of 100 Astra blades.</li>
            <li> I am trying to figure out what blade to use and this sampler definitely saves me a ton of money. I&#x27;ve only tried one blade of each shark, derby and feather so far. As far as I can tell, the Derby blades seem to be the best for my skin. This was a great decision on my part before investing in a whole 100 pack of something I wouldn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> I am new to double edge razors and this sampler pack has come in handy.  I haven&#x27;t tried all of the blades yet, but some do a better job than others and that is why I wanted to purchase this.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to safety razors like I was, getting one of these was critical to finding the right blade. Sharpest isn&#x27;t always better and brand quality may surprise you. Ultimately I went with the Gillette 7 O clock and the Feather Stainless.</li>
            <li> The offering was pretty great. I was able to test a different blade, each week, and with notes on each shave, I was able to narrow down the 2 best blades for me. If you&#x27;re curious, Feather and Shark, both worked extremely well on my razor/skin combination.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend just got a safety razor and we were so unsure of which blade brand would work best.  This pack made it so easy to test out different blades without all the running around or ordering individual packs from various sites.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t got any complaints. Everything was packed nice and was shipped quickly. It&#x27;s nice to have a variety to see what works best.</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast shipping! Satisfied customer!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I had read reviews of a few of these blades and wanted to try each of them before I committed to a larger order.  I only used the Feather, Astra, and Derby blades.  I tried two or three each before I settled on the Astra.  Other people love the Feather.  But for me, it was too rough during the first shave.  It evened out after the second shave.  The Astra, however, worked well from the first shave.  I try to use blades for three shaves only, and spaced about two or three days apart.  (Others only use the blades for one shave.)  The sample pack would last for a while if I used all the blades, but I ended up buying a bulk pack of the Astra before I even finished half of this pack.</li>
            <li> I got this kit when I first started wet shaving. I&#x27;d rather they take out the Derby an 7O&#x27;clock green. Perhaps add some Personnas or GIllette blacks in there place.</li>
            <li> I shave my head bald and my neck, keeping a short beard.  I am 1/2 African American 1/2 polish with corse curly hair and soft carmel colord skin.  I have been shaving my head bald since 1992.  I used to use Gillette Mach 3 then switched to gillette fusion proglide when those came out.  They were the only blades that minimized my razor bumps and razor burn. I could only use the gillettes twice before I would get irritation, so you can imagine how expensive buying refill cartridges got. All others, schick, Bic and the rest of the disposals on the market were just devastating to my neck and the nape of my head. I still have scars to this day.  After leaving sams club spending $100 on 28 gillette cartridges, I thought there has got to be a better way.  In my research I learned about DE shaving and decided to get the supplies and give it a try.  After learning DE shaving with shave soap and badger brush, I cant go back to my old way. Better shave with no more bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me the Astras worked best for my head and the feathers worked best for my neck.  The rest left me with some razor burn and irritation.  All were still better than the old cartridges I was used to.  Over all I would choose the Astras for me, and use each blade once, starting with my neck then the nape of my neck, then the rest of my head.  For fear of bumps, I still am afraid to try and shave against the grain.</li>
            <li> Lots of blades to try out arrived as pictured and fair price. Defently worth it to try out a lot of blades</li>
            <li> Good pack! I think I&#x27;m going with the asta&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Great combo, good price.</li>
            <li> Great set of starter blades for anyone getting into the safety razor shaving game. Personally, as a man with thicker hair, I find that using the Feather blades once with the grain and the second stroke against the grain gives a much cleaner look and feel. I don&#x27;t recommend the Derby blades as I went through them within a month, as I shave twice a day.</li>
            <li> Being new to DE razor shaving I appreciated the ability to buy a sample pack of many different razor blades.  So far the Shark is my favorite, but I have not tried all the blades yet.  No cuts or nicks yet!</li>
            <li> This pack is great for people who are starting out with wet shaving, and who are trying to figure out what blade works best - which is something I&#x27;d recommend you do before you buy a pack of just one brand. I haven&#x27;t used them all yet, but so far the Gillette 7 o&#x27; clock super platinum works like a charm for me. AND the package came sooner than expected. Totally happy with my decision.</li>
            <li> I really like that this particular sampler includes a five-pack of each blade. Every shave is different and even blades can have the occasional variation or defect. Having five blades each really helps you determine what actually works best instead of whether or not you simply had a particularly good or bad shave as a result of other variables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All aforementioned blades were included and in brand new condition. A negative rating based on individual blade dissatisfaction would be irrelevant and unfair to the seller, which I see some have failed to understand...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nice little sampler of preferred, higher-end blades at a fair price. If you&#x27;re new to wet shaving with a safety razor or still experimenting with different blades, then give it a try!</li>
            <li> This is a review for the sampler and not the individual blades. I do not have a problem with the blades, but If you are trying blades to decide what to use, I would instead use the sampler with 2 blades each rather than 5 as with this sampler. I think you can determine the type of blade that works for your skin from the second blade leaving 3 not used if you do not want to go back for them. As for the blades, it depends on your skin and what I recommend may not be for you.</li>
            <li> Pretty decent selection of blades. Great start for anyone trying to find the right blade.</li>
            <li> Nice selection of blades for a newby to safety razors. Good price good service.</li>
            <li> My husband has a problem with ingrown hairs and irritated skin and was using one of the disposable plastic 5+ blade razors.  He tried different shave creams but nothing seemed to help that much so I did some research and surprised him with a Merkur safety razor to try.  I purchased this sampler pack and the Van Der Hagan Men&#x27;s Luxury Shave set to get him started with everything he would need.  He is still making his way through the sample pack so he hasn&#x27;t decided on a favorite blade yet but all of them, with the safety razor as a whole, have provided a much more enjoyable, comfortable shaving experience.  It was not a miracle worker, as far as the ingrown hairs, but they are noticeably better and continuing to improve.  This is a great starter pack for someone who doesn&#x27;t know which blade they prefer.  I chose this one over other available sampler packs on Amazon because the brand of blades that are included in this one seemed to have the best reputation.  Shipping was originally dated for like 2 weeks but it arrived within a week which was much better.</li>
            <li> I received these yesterday.  I tried the Gillette Silver Blue.  It gave me a great and smooth shave.  No irritation, and I usually get slight irritation on my neck.  The seller even gave me a bonus pack of safety razors.  The only problem that I had was that some of the boxes showed some wear on them.  The box for the Gillette Silver Blues was even open at the end.  However, none of the blades had been opened, they were still sealed.  Also, the blades in the plastic containers still had the plastic wrapping on them.  However, because of the boxes being worn and/or opened I will give this product 4 stars.  Good deal... BUY THIS!!!</li>
            <li> Great sampler. The Astra razors are the ones a like the best but it was nice to get to try out different brands. I recommend for beginner wet shavers.</li>
            <li> When I first got into DE shaving, I used a couple blades from a friend but couldn&#x27;t find one that seemed right, so based off the other reviews, bought this pack.  This is by far the best idea for anyone getting into DE shaving.  Everyone&#x27;s face is different and the only way to find out the best combo for your face and razor is to buy a sampler pack like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Astra - Tried these first based on forums and a friend&#x27;s recommendation as a good starter blade.  This was not a winner for my face/razor.  By the end of the first shave, it started tugging a little and trying it a second shave was bad news bears for my mug.  Perhaps it was inexperience as I was learning, but I can&#x27;t forget the bad memories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Derby &amp; Shark - Similar experience to the Astra with an OK (but not super close) first shave, but bad bad irritation/bumps/ingrown hairs with any subsequent shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock - These blades worked pretty well with a nice close first shave and a perfectly acceptable 2nd shave.  The third shave was not as good, but depending on exactly how long between shaves (24 vs 36 vs 48), sometimes the third shave was fine too.  I used a couple of these blades and thought they would be my go-to blade for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feather - Once I started using these, I didn&#x27;t even go on with testing the others.  (Although from other reviews, maybe I should try the bluebirds).  These were far and away the best blades for me.  Unfortunately they&#x27;re also the most expensive (but still way cheaper than cartridges).  I could consistently get 3 shaves from each blade without my face and neck looking like I was back in high school with acne.  After using a couple blades, I was sold and bought a bulk pack which I use as my everyday blade now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have the remaining blades and perhaps I&#x27;ll revisit them if I&#x27;m feeling adventurous or I run out of my Feathers.  But for anyone starting out with DE shaving, do yourself a favor and buy a sampler pack.Although your face may dislike you for a time and you may look like you got in a fight with a badger, it&#x27;s worth it in the end to find that one blade.</li>
            <li> decently priced way to mess with some different blades... new to DE; tried a couple, found one that feels better than the rest on MY FACE (the Astra) and bought a hundred of them... I&#x27;m not a DE gear-junkie, just wanted to find a blade that I like.</li>
            <li> These blades are a great price and a good variety pack. So far I like the Fearher blades the most.</li>
            <li> Good selection of damn good blades for the NOOB wet shaver to try out and see what works best for them. SHAVE ON!</li>
            <li> Good variety pack of blades that allows you to find out which blade works for you. Feathers were the best for me, but that doesn&#x27;t hold true for everyone.</li>
            <li> I have been using these packs of razors for over 6 months now trying to find the ones i like. All of these razors are good but some are better than others, I personally prefer the feather ones because of the closeness of the shave i get with them.</li>
            <li> At just over $3 per pack, this DE set is a nice way to explore your blade options. It has seven packs of blades and is only missing a couple of brands that should be tried. I think it should include a pack of Gillette Platinum, but besides that the Derby, Bluebird, and Feather blades were a nice surprise, and give me options when purchasing blades.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, so this set is a nice way to find out what works best for you. I used an Edwin Jagger razor, Art of Shaving pre-shave oil/shaving cream/aftershave, and switched blades after every three shaves. I wrote a little review and assigned a number (4 being the highest) after three shave cycle which compared each blade to the Gillette Platinum. This is how I rated them. (I have semi-sensitive, fair skin, if that helps).&lt;br /&gt;Derby Extra: 4&lt;br /&gt;Feather Hi-Stainless: 3.75&lt;br /&gt;Shark Super Chrome: 3.5&lt;br /&gt;Blue Bird: 3.5&lt;br /&gt;Gillette Silver Blue: 3.25&lt;br /&gt;Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock: 3&lt;br /&gt;Astra Superior Platinum: 3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure your results will be different, but if you&#x27;re new to DE shaving, definitely try out some blades before settling on one. This set will start you off nicely!</li>
            <li> You get a little bit of everything. Some of what I really liked, others seemed to dislike and vice-verse a. So for a sample pack it does exactly what its supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Im thankful for this sample pack. Astra is my blade of choice</li>
            <li> let&#x27;s see, still need some time to discover ...</li>
            <li> Good variety in this pack. My favorites were the Feathers and Gillettes. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this for a newbie. There are enough blades here to last you at least 4 months.</li>
            <li> This is the best way to decide on which blade you&#x27;re going to use (a very personal choice).  Just one caution:  The FEATHER blades may come packaged under a silver and black label instead of the yellow one pictured.  That is OKAY.  These are still the same blades.  I was misinformed that silver and black was discontinued and not platinum coated.  These are the SAME blade.  But if you have and questions or problems I can tell you from personal experience:  Wish4Star ARE VERY CUSTOMER FRIENDLY.  They won&#x27;t ignore you!!!    UPDATE 9/29/2014  So far the Feathers work best for me (I&#x27;m using an Edwin Jagger DE89).    A very close second is the Gillette Silver-Blue.  The Derby&#x27;s were very acceptable.  The results are as good with these as the previous two *as long* as I&#x27;m doing a 3-pass shave.    The Shark&#x27;s REALLY deserve their name.  A lot of people really like them but they gave me THE WORST case of bumps and painful irritation I&#x27;ve ever had.  These are the worst for my sensitive skin.  The Astra&#x27;s are also no good for me and that&#x27;s a shame as they are sharp and not expensive.  But using them was a painful experience.  I still have to try the Blue Birds and the 7 O&#x27;clock Gillettes.     But I am *really* happy with the Silver Blue and the Feathers.</li>
            <li> I bought this sampler pack with my first safety razor. It&#x27;s perfect for figuring out which blade is right for you. Each pack has five blades and each blade lasted me about a week of two passes each morning. I&#x27;ve recommended this particular sampler to several friends over the last year.</li>
            <li> Bits of metal, sharp, fits a de razor.  More came than is listed in the listing.  Woot woot! More words.</li>
            <li> My preference (in order):&lt;br /&gt;Astra&lt;br /&gt;Gilette Silver Blue&lt;br /&gt;Gilette 7&#x27;Oclock&lt;br /&gt;Feather&lt;br /&gt;and then the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my face and the way I shave, the Astra is the perfect blade. I wanted to like the Feather, but it is far too aggressive for my face and technique and most times left my feeling slightly razor burned with not as close a shave as I could get out the Astra. This is an intensely personal and subjective choice though, so the sampler packs are the way to go for someone just starting with Safety Razor shaving.</li>
            <li> If you are new to DE shaving you will need to buy one of the sampler packs. I found that this one had all the blades that I wanted to try. After going through all of them I have found the one that best suits me, the Shark Super Chrome. I do not regret at all buying this sampler pack.</li>
            <li> Got me the ability to try a ton of things.  Not bad at all.  Good mix of blades, a lot of the popular ones from forums.</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I ordered. All the blades arrived promptly and I&#x27;ve begun using them as a means to figure out which razors will be the right ones for me. I find that the number of blades is right to get a feel for how the blades perform. Not too much to it. I don&#x27;t feel like the product should be rated on how good the actual blades are, since it&#x27;s main purpose is to supply a basis for comparison and it does that with a decent selection. I must say I have grown partial to the 7 o&#x27;clocks.</li>
            <li> Got everything I wanted in the same exact packaging as pictured, and the blades are great! So far the Gillette and feather blades are my favorite</li>
            <li> I tried 7 different brands in this pack and it was instructive. As such, this was an excellent product for the purpose of trying different blades for wet shaving. I only wish that it had included Persona Israeli Reds, a highly recommended brand. But it is a good collection and good price for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brand I rated highest was by far the Feather blades. They are sharper than the others, so you have to be a bit more careful; just don&#x27;t press on the razor, let gravity do the work as the experts on wet shaving advise. Even though sharpest, they left fewer nicks and red spots than the others, because they didn&#x27;t tug as I shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product collection.</li>
            <li> A great way to try a bunch of different blades at a reasonable price.  I recommend it for anyone new to shaving.</li>
            <li> got me on to the blade I like now.  Good way to try them out.</li>
            <li> Great selection to get to know which you like and don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> Blade assortment arrived on time and as promised. I&#x27;ve not tried all the individual blades yet, this is a very good way to determine which one will work best for your needs (skin, face,skill in use), etcetera!</li>
            <li> I found this to be a decent sample pack.  It helped me determine which blade I like best with my razor.  Sample packs are nice because they let you have enough of one blade to see how well it works but not too many to regret purchasing a bad one.  I combined this sample pack with another to find my blade of choice.</li>
            <li> If you or your other half has a safety razor, I highly recommend this sampler.  It was a great way to allow my husband to find his favorite without spending a ton of money!</li>
            <li> My review is based on the sampler itself. I have to commend them for recognizing the fact that there is a great difference in blade brands and for making this sampler available. As with most people every result is quite different depending on the blade which works best for them. This is why this simple sampler truly came in handy. Being relatively new to DS/wet shaving I needed a way to see which blade truly does work best for me. This sampler is the best option I&#x27;ve seen yet to help with your decision.    Just so people know, my personal results are following (from best to worst):    1. Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock - These felt the best with the fewest nicks. Gave me a clean shave and comfortable shave.  2. Gillette Silver Blue - Almost the same results with only a couple nicks on rare occasion. Still a very good razor.  3. Shark - A very sharp blade, yet still gave good results.  4. Derby - Truly a middle of the pack blade. A clean shave, but several nicks made it a little uncomfortable after a couple shaves on each blade.  5. Feather - Another very sharp blade that wasn&#x27;t the best for me. Felt a bit of pulling and had a fare amount of razor burn.  6. Blue Bird - Got a good amount of pulling and several nicks. Only used a couple blades before moving on.  7. Astra - By far the worst shave of them all. I bled like a stuffed pig using these. Nicks and cuts abound. I barely finished one shave with these and put them away.</li>
            <li> The only blades,I have tried in this sampler pack was the feathers, in my edwin jagger 89bl razor.The first three shave with the feather were great,after that started get a few weepers, these blades are real sharp, make sure your angle is right with this blades.trying to stick to the same blade so ,I know which blades works best for me.</li>
            <li> Great variety pack. First time DE safety razor user and this was awesome for getting a feel for blade differences.</li>
            <li> This set really helps you to get a feel of the different blades available.  I&#x27;ve narrowed my choice already.</li>
            <li> Purchased this sample pack when I bought the Merkur 34c razor.  Having the ability to try several different blades with the razor to get the best shave is definitely a plus.  Being new to the double edge safety razor (switched from disposables), I am already finding out that I get a much better shave with Astra blades vs. some of the others.</li>
            <li> My husband asked me to order this set for him.  It was the perfect way to try several different blade brands without spending a small fortune.  Being new to using a safety razor, he was curious about the performance of different blades.  This product allowed him to try several types for an extended period and was extremely affordable.  I wish I had ordered the sampler when I ordered his razor.</li>
            <li> An excelent range of blades to help you find your favorite. I tried each blade, and after several rounds of &amp;#34;cuts&amp;#34;, I settled on the Derby Extras. Though this set is more expensive than a pack of a single brand of blades, it is still far, FAR cheaper than the &amp;#34;supersonic&amp;#34; blades I used to buy. And well worth the money to find a blade I&#x27;m happy with.</li>
            <li> It does seem apparent everyone&#x27;s experience is different, as I see positive remarks around for blades that I found completely worthless.  I bought a 1962 Gillette Super Speed from Ebay, which came with some Super Max Super Stainless blades, which I also review here.    I have a very course beard and need a very sharp blade to get through it smoothly.  I also have to shave against the grain to get a smooth shave, which only works with a sharp blade in good condition.    A good shave for me is when it slides over my beard with minimal rasping.  Light passes for beard gradual reduction are the only way to get a good bloodless shave for me.    My ratings, FWIW:    1.  Super Max Super Stainless (not in this pack).  Smooth, sharp first shave glides through the beard like butter, good 2nd and OK 3rd.  Given its first shave is similar to Feather but it lasts better, at 30% of the cost, this is a winner.    2.  Feather.  Lovely first shave, rapidly downhill after that.  Second is a bit rough, third is very ropey.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s strong enough to hold a good edge.    3.  Bluebird.  Pretty decent, but not great, for 3 shaves    4.  Astra.  tolerable for 2 or 3 shaves    5.  Gillette blue - not sharp, but kind forgiving if unpleasant.  I&#x27;m leaving a couple of those unused.    6.  Derby - really not sharp, though seemingly fairly easy to avoid bloodshed.    7.  Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock.  Crap.  I used a second one to make sure it wasn&#x27;t a bad blade.  3 are going in the trash.    8.  Shark.  Utter crap.  Ditto - 3 in the trash.    So I see a deal on 200 Super Max Super Stainless for $17.00, and I&#x27;m taking that.  At that price I may only use each one for two shaves, and enjoy the luxury.  I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;d have done without that pack - probably suck up the price of Feathers.  Perhaps at the end of my 200 pack (in a couple of years) I&#x27;ll try to find a premium sampler...</li>
            <li> Great collection to get started and explore different blades. I recognize it is not practical for the individual manufacturers, but it would be better it the assortment was offered in smaller quantities per blade. I don&#x27;t need 5 blades to determine if I like it or not.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;feather&amp;#34; blades are by far my favorite.  Very sharp and holds and edge a long time.</li>
            <li> Gives me a chance to sample various blades, the Astra and Feather are very good, Derby is OK, the rest, although better than cartridge, are not keepers for me although I know people that like them.</li>
            <li> I think getting this variety pack is a great way to start if you are new to shaving with a straight razor.&lt;br /&gt; I quickly learned that the Feather blades are way too sharp for my sensitive skin. Shark can be a little to sharp for me too.&lt;br /&gt;So far Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock has given me the smoothest shave that hasn&#x27;t been too sharp. The only way to find out which blades are best for you is to try them.&lt;br /&gt;I usually get 2 or 3 shaves out of each blade; I shave every other day. So paying $20 will get you 35 blades which last 4 days each  for me. Im getting 140 days out of this pack which is slightly less 15 CENTS a day. Take that dollar shave club</li>
            <li> The product was as expected. This is my first time using a DE razor, so I don&#x27;t have any worthwhile feedback other than they fit in my Merkur Futur as expected.</li>
            <li> I bought this to figure out what kind of blades I will like the most. I&#x27;m not done with them all but at the cost, I figure the experiment is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a nice sampler pack. The vendor shipped the items quickly, and all items are as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have used 3 different blades so far in Jagger 89.  All three were a single blade that was used for a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillete 7 Oclock: These blades gave a nice shave.  They seemed to be a good balance of between mild and aggressive.  A good blade for someone new to shaving with a DE razor perhaps.  No complaints and I would buy these again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sharks:  Seem more aggressive, but any difficulties I had were solved when I wet the lather a bit more.  Again, a good blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feathers:  Dayumm.  These are sharp blades, and zoom right through whiskers.  They also require you to be a bit more careful, however they are very nice.  I would also purchase these again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The others are yet to be used.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this assortment.  It&#x27;s the only way to find a blade that you like.  So far I like the Derby blade the best.  Currently using the bluebird nothing wrong with it just like the Derby better so far.  Also have used the Merkur blade that came with the razor. . It s very sharp wouldn&#x27;t recommend as using for your first shave. I cut my neck up pretty good not realizing how sharp it was and being my first shave with a double edge.</li>
            <li> I bought this and went through every single brand, and found that Feather and the Blue Bird were my favorite with Feather on top by quite a lot. The Sharks were in third with Astra, then Derby, then the Gilletes coming in last. To summarize:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Feather&lt;br /&gt;2) Blue Bird&lt;br /&gt;3) Shark&lt;br /&gt;4) Astra&lt;br /&gt;5) Derby&lt;br /&gt;6) Gillete Silver Blue&lt;br /&gt;7) Gillete 7 O&#x27;Clock&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was about to buy a 100 pack of Feather blades, but I stumbled on some reviewers for the Feather blades who recommended Crystal Platinums over the Feathers. I took the gamble and bought the Crystal Platinums and was glad I did. I wish that this pack included the Crystal Platinums, but this is still a good pack to start with as most likely you&#x27;ll find a favorite in here. But I would recommend finding a sample pack with the Crystals in them.</li>
            <li> Like many other reviews, this allows you to try out a few popular brands that make the double edged flat blade replacement.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t even got through the first blade, let alone opened another package.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re paying a premium for convenience, but you&#x27;re getting what you pay for: a good mix of the brands that I&#x27;ve seen name-dropped the most often, either as top brands (e.g., feather &amp; 7 o&#x27;clock) or common but well reviewed brands (e.g., derby). I&#x27;ve been experimenting with each in turn, and once I settle on my favorite, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll buy from here on out.</li>
            <li> gives you a good choice of the right blades to best suite your needs you can not find these blades in most stores</li>
            <li> If you are just getting into shaving like your grampa, this is an EXCELLENT way to sample different manufacturer&#x27;s DE Blades and find what works best for you. Glad I tried this, and would highly recommend it!! Worth every penny! :)</li>
            <li> A great collection of blades. So far I&#x27;ve been enjoying the Feather, and Astra blades the most!</li>
            <li> A great amount of sample packs, still working through them.</li>
            <li> Item delivered as described and a day early.</li>
            <li> lots of blades,lots of choices,and inexpensive.what more could you want?</li>
            <li> I was not getting a close shave with the Derbys, which is a shame as I have 100 of the things.  I was ready to get the highly rated Feathers but someone convinced me to try a sample pack.  Glad I did as the Feathers were a bit too aggressive but the included 7 O&#x27;Clocks are an excellent match for me.  We&#x27;re all different and a sample kit is a wise choice.</li>
            <li> Nice sampler kit.  I&#x27;m new to wet shaving and wanted to try the different blades to see what worked best for my skin.</li>
            <li> I got this sampler pack after purchasing a Merkur 34C razor.  There were a couple of blades that came with the razor but I soon needed a refill.  I&#x27;ve heard a lot of people talk about blades in the wet shaving community, and gathered the choice of blades could be very important.  I had heard different people recommend different blades so wasn&#x27;t sure which ones to purchase.  Doing a sampler pack is the best way to figure out which ones you like for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After finishing the sampler I ordered a 100-pack of the Astra blades.  I also enjoyed the Feather blades (although the seemed a tad sharp) as well as the Blue Bird and Derby ones.  The Gillette blades seemed a little dull for my taste though, although they also seemed to give good results.</li>
            <li> Working my way through the blades.  I like shark the best so far.  Gillette silver the worst.  Feather is up next</li>
            <li> Great selection. Offers a chance to try several blade manufacturers.</li>
            <li> Nice collection of blades as a sample. Was nice to have multiple brands to find the one I like the best... which I did!</li>
            <li> This pack helped me discover my favorites: Astra Super Platinum and Feather</li>
            <li> Good tester pack. If your just wet shaving try this first.</li>
            <li> great assortment, and quick ship. It was exactly as shown in the picture and the description. I have not had a chance to use all of them yet but hope to find a winner!</li>
            <li> I was mostly interested in the Bluebird, Feather, Astra and Derby blades. My razor came with a pack of Merkur sample blades. So here is where I am so far on these blades:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8.  Sharks - I used one blade and threw the rest away. I had three major nicks and my skin felt raw. I will not use Sharks.  Interestingly, I disliked the Feathers almost as much. I have read elsewhere that Feathers are the sharpest blades available. So, maybe Sharks are also very sharp and I just do not like very sharp blades for the way I shave.&lt;br /&gt;7. Feather - Everyone says that this blade is the sharpest and I believe them. I think I am a bit too heavy handed a shaver to use these blades.  Like the Sharks, I had a pretty bad nick on my upper lip. I think I pushed a bit too hard.  Perhaps this was the problem with the Sharks too.  I have not yet thrown the Feathers away. I think I will try one more time with a much lighter touch. If I get a bad nick again, I am tossing them too.&lt;br /&gt;6. Derby - I thought I would like this blade, but it left my neck feeling raw.  I will try one more blade, but if this happens again, I will discard these like I did with the Sharks.&lt;br /&gt;5. Gillette Silver Blue - I get one good shave with this blade. The second it is too dull. I will use up the pack of 5, dispose of the blade after each shave, but not buy these again.&lt;br /&gt;5. Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock - Similar to the Silver Blue, I get one good shave. I will use these blades for one shave and not buy them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Bluebird - Great shave. These blades have to be in the same class as Astra and Merkur.  I use this blade, like the others, to go with and against the grain and I do not feel a tug. This blade is plenty sharp enough for my beard.&lt;br /&gt;1. Astra -  I love the Astras. I have only used one blade, but the first shave was perfect and the second was better than any other blade I have tried.  I used it for a third shave and it was fine. I think that is the life of these blades for my beard, three shaves.  For the record, I do a double and sometimes a triple pass for each shave.&lt;br /&gt;1. Merkur (not in this product, but came with my razor) - I know these are not in the pack, but I got three good shaves out of each blade (by shave, I mean a double or triple pass shave).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used one blade from each of these brands. I am glad I bought this variety pack, but I suppose that I am not as sensitive as others, I really cannot find a great deal of difference between the Bluebird, Astra, and Merkur.  So, it comes down to price for me.  I will not buy the others that I did not rate as #1, so in that sense, it was good to get a variety pack.  My blade will be the best priced among the three I liked.  So here is my list of the ones I liked and their prices on Amazon in the order of price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  [[ASIN:B001QY8QXM 100 Astra Superior Premium Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades]]  at $0.10 apiece&lt;br /&gt;2.  [[ASIN:B002DZ0N2K 100 BlueBird Razor Blades Hi Stainless Double Edge Blades]] at $0.18 apiece&lt;br /&gt;4.  [[ASIN:B000JPMHWK Merkur-Razor Double Edge Razor Blades]] at $0.55 apiece&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I think I may be an Astra man.</li>
            <li> I got this sampler for the Astra, 7 O&#x27;Clock and Feather (yellow pkg) . 2 out of 3 came as expected. The Feathers were the black and silver pack. Went back and checked the Amazon page and notice something. The product page shows a yellow Feather package but when you add it to cart and look at it in the cart, the black and silver Feathers are shown. The picture changes between the main product page and the Cart page! Not the end of the world but was a little disappointed. Minus one star for the bait and switch picture thing and minus one star for not getting what I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 28 y/o caucasian, with almost sensitive skin and regular (not thin, not coarse), full (grows evenly on my face) beard. I&#x27;ve been shaving with an Edwin Jagger DE89L razor for the past six months or so, along with the Van der Haagen Luxury Kit, and this has been a wonderful experience. I switched over from Gillete Sensor blades, which is are no longer made. I also owned a few electric shavers that were good, but always broke down and new models show up every year. So this (shaving with double-edge safety blades), I believe, is the perfect system. It&#x27;s manly, classy, reliable and affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the blades. I went through these in various &amp;#34;rounds&amp;#34; to determine which were the best for me, considering my current kit. This is the list from worst to best:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Shark Super Stainless: These were, by far, the absolute worst blades I tried. I did not get a decent shave and I suffered terribly from a lot of &amp;#34;tug and pull&amp;#34;. I tried two of them, thinking maybe the first blade I tried was a lemon, but I completely discarded them at round 2. I might use them to cut stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Derby: These were the first I tried since I received 5 of them with my razor. They were comfortable to shave with, but the shave was not close at all. They were also dropped at round 2, but only because I had tried them before. I&#x27;d probably recommend these to those with sensitive skin and/or thin facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Gillete 7 O&#x27;clock: I was surprised at my first shave with these, better than Astra (see below), but at round 2, I felt some &amp;#34;tug and pull&amp;#34;, which were also present on round 3, where they were dropped, so they may not be as consistent. I&#x27;ll give these another go, just to be sure, and update this review IF NECESSARY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Blue Bird: These made it to the 5th and final round and provide an awesome shave. If Feather (see below) is a 10/10 in closeness, these are easily a 9.5/10. However, I suffered from some &amp;#34;tug and pull&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Astra: These are maybe the best blades overall since I&#x27;ve had really really good and comfortable shaves with them, although not as close as Blue Bird (see above) or Feather (see below). These were dropped on round 4 only because they were super consistent throughout all rounds and I was looking mostly for the closest shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Feather: What can I say? These provided the absolute best shave in both comfort and closeness. I had no nicks or cuts at all, so don&#x27;t be afraid! The only drawbacks are that the sharpness doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long (you get maybe three perfect shaves per blade) and the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: The last three blades are all magnificent. I may stick to Astra as my main, go-to, everyday blades and Feather as my &amp;#34;special occasion&amp;#34; blade. That way, there really is no point in enduring the &amp;#34;tug and pull&amp;#34; from Blue Birds.pull&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Astra: These are maybe the best blades overall since I´ve had really really good and comfortable shaves with them, although not as close as Blue Bird (see above) or Feather (see below). These were dropped on round 4 only because they were super consistent throughout all rounds and I was looking mostly for the closest shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Feather: What can I say? These provided the absolute best shave in both comfort and closeness. I had no nicks or cuts at all, so don´t be afraid! The only drawbacks are that the sharpness doesn´t seem to last as long (you get maybe three perfect shaves per blade) and the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: The last three blades are all magnificent. I may stick to Astra as my main, go-to, everyday blades and Feather as my &amp;#34;special occasion&amp;#34; blade. That way, there really is no point in enduring the &amp;#34;tug and pull&amp;#34; from Blue Birds.</li>
            <li> Everything was what I wanted in the sampler pack and I am currently starting with the blue birds. I really enjoy them, but I am having a hard time finding them to buy on Amazon. I am sure I will like some of the others though. If looking for a sampler blade pack, look here. Its great!</li>
            <li> I ordered these razors to get a good assortment of blades to try. I was really looking forward to trying the Bluebird razors, but imagine my suprise when they were not part of the pack. Instead I was sent Bic Chrome Platinums. I&#x27;ve already used these and wasn&#x27;t happy with them to begin with. The picture and description listed Shark (received), Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock (received), Astra, Derby and Feather (all received). Too bad I got screwed on the Bluebirds. Won&#x27;t order these again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Within a few hours of posting this comment, I was contacted by the company and not only received an apology, but they are sending the correct blades. While the mistake happened, and mistakes happen with anyone, I am seriously impressed with the customer service, and quality of care I received. After seeing as how this company puts customers first, I am changing over to 5 stars, and will continue to use this company from now on. Keep up the great work, and know that how you treat customers is sometimes more important than the product itself.</li>
            <li> A mix of good blades and bad .... depends on your beard and skin.</li>
            <li> I prefer the Gillette and Bluebird myself. However, a good mix should get any amateur started.  Batman shaves with a double edge safety razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shaved with 4 of these brands so far, and I am really glad I had the opportunity to try these brands. Razor blades are something that you must experience rather than relying on the advice of others. This pack gives you 7 brands, 5 blades each, so you can find a great blade to give you a great shave.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had a chance to try all blades yet. DERBY EXTRA is the first blade I tried. After about ten shaves, it&#x27;s still going strong. I believe the shaving cream has a lot to do with the good results. Taylor of Old Bond Street soap, when used as dry as possible, works very well. -Used to work with a soap cake; wish I would have known about the Bond Street soap years ago.</li>
            <li> good versatility and it lets you figure out what you like</li>
            <li> This is a great pack if you want to try out different blades for your DE.  I bought a Edwin Jagger razor that came with Derby blades, which I liked so that was one reason to choose this pack.  I would rate them as tied for 1st and 2nd place, the Gilelette blades.  I love both and give me a great shave every day for about a week.  A close 3rd is the Feather brand.  Derby would be 4th, and the others last.  I tried the Bluebird and Astra, and they tore up my face so I didn&#x27;t get into the Shark one.  I&#x27;ll probably end up ordering a case of the 7 O&#x27;Clock.</li>
            <li> Great combo pack, let&#x27;s you try different blades and find what you like. I found I like Wilkinson the best, but still a good pack.</li>
            <li> Good for trying out several different types and brands.  At the rate I shave, this pack will last me a year and I&#x27;ll keep buying this pack for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li> Provides a good example of different blades with enough blades to try in many razors ea blade may&lt;br /&gt;Reform different in another razor so try again</li>
            <li> These little razors arrived quickly and as advertised.  I bought them because I&#x27;m trying out different blades in order to figure out which ones will work best for shaving my legs.  I have so far only shaved with the cheapest/dullest blade in the bunch, and I am in love.  Does this mean it will only get better?  I can&#x27;t believe it; I have never had such a close shave in my entire life.  All the blades are individually wrapped in paper, which is adorable, or, as adorable as razor blades can be :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After using my safety razor for the past month or so, I have mastered the technique.  I now shave using the very sharp feather blades.  I apply almost no pressure and let the razor/blade glide down my skin.  These blades are so sharp that you really just need to let them do all the work.  They are awesome and I will never go back to using a standard razor to shave my legs ever again.  What a great find :)</li>
            <li> Thanks! Still working my way through all the blades. Just as pictured, unlike some of the other blade samplers sold on here.</li>
            <li> Helped narrow down which razors work best for my face. I found that Feathers, Sharks and Astra&#x27;s cut best through my coarse hair, with Astra&#x27;s leaving the smoothest shave. Derby&#x27;s had varied results, with one blade leaving a clean close smooth shave and another itching as I was shaving with it. The rest I&#x27;ve given to my girlfriend, who was lucky enough to have finer hair.</li>
            <li> Package was as described; however, I found a couple of hairs stuck to the pkg tape.. kind of disgusting..</li>
            <li> Good sample pack. Only complaint is some of the blades aren&#x27;t that great and you&#x27;ll be stuck with extra blades you don&#x27;t want, but so is the nature of a sample pack!</li>
            <li> Not exactly as pictured. My feather blades were thrown in loosely not in a small 5 blade box like the other brands. Not sure if that would effect their sharpness or not, but it makes me wonder since I didn&#x27;t not find them to be that sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose this sampler because I kept seeing names like Astra, Derby and Feather showing up when doing DE shaving research. To my surprise I preferred the Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock blades to all the rest.</li>
            <li> Great way to try out several different razor brands to find out what works best. Every face is different so, I&#x27;d highly recommend trying out several before settling on one brand of razor. The razors come in sealed packages of 5. Each one is wrapped in wax paper. Even though it&#x27;s more cost effective, I didn&#x27;t want to buy 50-100 of 1 razor type until I found one that I liked best. Still trying to figure out which works best for me...</li>
            <li> Great way to try out a bunch of different brands and find out which work best without spending a lot of money.</li>
            <li> if you are new to DE shaving than this can give you good idea as to which blades work best for you. majority of the blades are sharp and work without giving me nicks.</li>
            <li> Great variety for a first timer. This variety pack let my husband try out many to find the perfect match for his hair and skin type. Plus they&#x27;re lasting for ever. Also, now I perfer to shave with his razor too.</li>
            <li> Good variety of blades all of high quality.&lt;br /&gt;I like this pack for being able to try out several different types of blades to figure out which is the right one for me. There&#x27;s enough blades in here to last you quite a while as well.</li>
            <li> great selection of blades</li>
            <li> The blades came packaged in a ziplock baggie and were exactly as pictured. I added a five pack of Wilkinson Swords and got everything I wanted to try plus a couple of others.</li>
            <li> Good variety. Still pricey for seven 5-packs, but necessary if you&#x27;re looking for the right blade for your face.</li>
            <li> Overpriced for what you actually receive. Check out maggardrazors.com and get a sampler of exactly which blades you want to try.</li>
            <li> Great priced sampler pack for the new safety razor user (me).  Hated the Shark, but the rest are well worth using till the end of the 5 packs. Mine came with Bluebird (not Gillette Platinum as pictured). Very impressed with the Gillette Silver Blue and 7 o&#x27;clock based on their 50/100 count price online, may end up going with those.</li>
            <li> A nice sample pack to try different blades to determine what you prefer.  I prefer Feather, followed by Shark.</li>
            <li> Good selection of what is considered the higher end DE blades.  Everyone&#x27;s face is different, and different blades better suit people and razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, people are frequently very favorable to the Derby blades, however in my razors, for my face, I found them to pull and be quite uncomfortable.  The Astra blades seemed to work quite well.  I&#x27;ve not made it any further through them yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great way to avoid purchasing a lot of blades that you won&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My blade selection was exactly what you see in the photo.  (5) each of Gillette Silver Blue, Gillette Platinum, Astra, Shark, Feather, Derby, and Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock.</li>
            <li> Great purchase to learn which blade works for you.  I have a thick beard, corse hair, and sensitive skin. This review is based on a 5 day shaving cycle.  Used with the Parker 99R.&lt;br /&gt;Gillette Silver Blue - consistently close, irritation free - felt as if was gliding across my skin.  effortless.&lt;br /&gt;Feather - consistently close - sharpest - exceptional&lt;br /&gt;Astra &amp; Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock - consistent not quite as close as the first two still a pleasure to use&lt;br /&gt;Bluebird - good conistent shave just not quite as close - minor pulling on day 5&lt;br /&gt;Shark - close shave first two days - pulled on third.  I like the blade but would have to use two a week.&lt;br /&gt;Derby - pulled on first day - switched it out - same happened with second blade - I have read several good reviews of this blade - must have been a QC issue</li>
            <li> Started shaving with a safety razor about a year ago and this sample pack is an awesome way to get a feel for different blades. I only new of Derby and one other (not in the pack) before and had no idea there were as many companies making DE blades until I found this (and other) packs. Cant beat the price either :-)</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to DE shaving, a blade sample pack is a must. This is a great assortment of blades - it&#x27;ll take a while to find the one that works best for you. After a few weeks of trying them all, I&#x27;m down to a 2-way tie between the Astra and the Derby blades, but that&#x27;s just me - YMMV.</li>
            <li> Came in a lil baggy with all of them in there. All were sealed with either plastic or just the boxes had cutouts. All the lil boxes are cute and I cant wait to try them out.</li>
            <li> I bought this sampler pack because I was new to DE shaving and didn&#x27;t know what I was looking for yet.  Now after doing a lot more research, I know that the only really good blades in this pack are the Feathers, Silver Blue, and maybe Bluebirds - the rest are cheap filler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the blades, while cheap, are popular because they&#x27;re forgiving (Astra, Derby), but if you have a thick heavy beard they probably will not be sharp enough for you.  I&#x27;d recommend trying to find a &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; pack with Feather, Wilkinson Sword, maybe some Blue Personna, Crystal, etc., or just buying small packs a la carte until you find what works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are my reviews of each blade...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Derby and Astra - smooth blades but pretty dull... only good for daily shaving / touchups - not 2- or 3-day growth.  Maybe good for light beards and/or sensitive skin... one positive - no irritation even with multiple passes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock - sharp but not very smooth or consistent blade&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette Silver Blue - improvement over the 7 o&#x27;clocks, sharp and smooth, and fairly rugged (4-5 shaves per blade)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bluebird - smooth, sharp blade... the coating helps with irritation and how it feels on your face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shark - cheap blade that starts off sharp but dulls after 1-2 shaves&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feathers - extremely sharp and aggressive... if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing, be prepared to bleed and enjoy a couple days of irritation afterward... these blades will shave off the slightest of bumps or imperfections on your face - comparable to a freshly honed straight razor.  BE CAREFUL!</li>
            <li> Used this to find out that Durby and Astra are the rasers that work best with my face.  Great way to try out blades.</li>
            <li> Good starter pack if your interested in trying out different brands. The Feather ones were my favorite though</li>
            <li> If you buy a razor definitely buy a variety pack to try out and find the perfect blade for your skin. For example, I bought and excellent razor, but I did not like the blades it came with (this is the razor I bought and I love it: Edwin Jagger De89lbl Double Edge Safety Razor Chrome Plated Lined Detail, Chrome). I bought this variety pack and it changed the whole experiencing of shaving entirely. I have tried about half of those blades so far and I think I like the Gilette blade the most, but that&#x27;s me, you will be different. A variety pack like that is a must especially for starters. If you feel like razor shaving is not for you, you are just wrong, because you haven&#x27;t tried enough of blades to find the one for you. Initially I felt disappointed to have spent so much money on a razor, brush, creams, soaps and so on, but now I would never go back to anything else. Shaving with those blades is the best experience and the best feel after shaving. And if you do not shave against the grain you will never have inlfamated, soar, red skin anymore. These blades are better than any modern 3 or 5 blades system that cost 3-5 dollars per set. This set of blades can last you for an year and are much cheaper and environmentally friendly than anything else. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li> Picked this up to sample what was out there... and I am glad I did.  I&#x27;m still working through the different brands, but definitely have my favorites and &amp;#34;will never buy again&amp;#34;.  Great way to find what works for you... worth the purchase for new or old DE users.</li>
            <li> Nice sample pack to get you started on your own DE razor addiction.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell a difference. Everyone preached about having to try out several brands. Bulls***. Buy the Astra 100 blade pack or whatever reputable company offers for 10 bucks and never need a blade again.    If this is what you want there is nothing wrong with the blades. Go for it. Just felt like I wasted money is all.</li>
            <li> Exactly what it says a sampler pack of double edged razors.  Someone suggested to me that I get a sampler (since I&#x27;m a first time safety razor user) to get a sense of what works best for my skin... and this certainly provided that assortment.</li>
            <li> good selection. makes it easier to find correct blade for razor and your face. The shark blades work well for me. The feathers I use on 2 day growth only. They are sharp.</li>
