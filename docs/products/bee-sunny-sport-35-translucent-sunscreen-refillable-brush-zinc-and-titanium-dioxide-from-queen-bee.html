            <li>Even on non-active days it is a great, translucent powder.</li>
            <li>; Works great in toddler scalps.</li>
            <li>It is very effective.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t be good for you).  </li>
            <li>It is good for my skin, and doesn&#x27;t contain harmful chemicals.  </li>
            <li>It is good for what I use it for.</li>
            <li>so like I said, it&#x27;s good for whatnonuse it for.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and so does my daughter</li>
            <li>Great coverage and easy to re-apply!</li>
            <li>I will get the powder out and use my own brush to see how good the sunscreen powder is.</li>
            <li>This product has come in handy on so many occasions.</li>
            <li>The retractable brush makes the application easy!</li>
            <li>It needs a better design, like a retractable brush or a sleeve that fits from the bottom up.  </li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>The packaging is great, the applicator works well and is very convenient.</li>
            <li>Better than cream screens and love</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>So I bought this for the convenience of having a portable refillable non spilling container and the convenience of being able to apply it to her head and not worry about her hair getting gummy or greasy.  </li>
            <li>it is also very light and easy to carry in my pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the fact I can easily apply this to my kids.</li>
            <li>I guess it was, because after using this I will happily apply my old lotion sunscreen.</li>
            <li>easily--</li>
            <li>The sunscreen works fine.  </li>
            <li>It is light and lets my skin breathe.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited about this product and bought one for me and my mom.</li>
            <li>it does not let her scalp burn which is the original reason why i bought it.  </li>
            <li>The sun protection, which is ultimately the most important aspect of sunscreen, is phenomenal.</li>
            <li>So what i am trying to say is - good product, use as directed, beware that it may leave a white coating</li>
            <li>I often use the aerosol on my daughter because it covers quickly and she can go play, but every time i tried putting a hat on her</li>
            <li>Nice idea however product is vey white on skin &amp; lid</li>
            <li>I ended up putting the sunscreen in an old mineral foundation container and use my own high quality powder brush to apply it.</li>
            <li>Make sure to apply it in multiple directions and often to avoid sunburn though.</li>
            <li>When I opened the container for my first application a bunch of powder spilled out of it.</li>
            <li>Works really well on children, too!</li>
            <li>i used it today for the first time and the cap doesn&#x27;t stay on and the bottom unscrews way too</li>
            <li>the similar peter thomas roth product has a much better design.</li>
            <li>This means reapplication (which is required) is not difficult at all.</li>
            <li>i spend a lot of time outside in the summer and this is easy to reapply on the go.  </li>
            <li>Plus the burn is very even, it looks like I didn&#x27;t wear any sunscreen at all.</li>
            <li>In short, I don&#x27;t like the refillable brush and rather use my own traditional brush.</li>
            <li>It does come out a little too much so you have to spread upright in order to not have more sunscreen emptying out onto your child.</li>
            <li>While the Colorscience product is more expensive, you get what you pay for -- a much better brush, powder that sticks better to dry skin, and ultimately a lot less waste and more precise applicaation.</li>
            <li>We live in Florida</li>
            <li>It is easy to carry to the pool, and it isn&#x27;t messy.  </li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>an A++ for improving on old style lotion sunblock.</li>
            <li>falls off frequently product spilled in my purse &amp; brush</li>
            <li>It is particularly helpful when trying to get kids covered, especially those hard-to-reach areas like the ears!</li>
            <li>so this is a super product to  reapply during a round of golf without get all greasy.</li>
            <li>One major problem-</li>
            <li>The dispenser releases far too much powder, making it hard to apply to one&#x27;s face without creating a cloud of titanium dioxide powder.</li>

            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use it at the beach or for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> They certainly prefer it to being wiped down with conventional sunscreen and moms will appreciate not having their hands covered in greasy sunscreen after applying to the little ones.</li>
            <li> As to the sunscreen powder, I am not sure whether it really function the way it claims as I cannot bear the stiff bristle.</li>
            <li> but i think it should have been every hour because i didnt fully burn but was still a little red.  </li>
            <li> Keep your eyes, and nostrils, closed, and be prepared to dust nearby surfaces.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;year round, and are out in the sun daily.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if i am overapplying it or that the product is just like this, but it does leave a white coating ...</li>
            <li> The applicator doesn&#x27;t control the quantity at all, and the brush is such poor quality that it scratches and you end up with white patches all over your face.</li>
            <li> I am active outdoors and it goes in every pack from mountain biking, climbing to day and multi-day hikes.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product, but it is so incredibly messy and impossible to get the cap back on without getting powder everywhere</li>
            <li> it looks a little girly putting it on, but nothing gets in my eyes.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Just a few brush strokes and you are covered.  </li>
            <li> Not cheap</li>
            <li> I find the bristle stiff and not comfortable during application.</li>
            <li> It is also not easy to control the amount of powder.</li>
            <li> No more messy, greasy lotions.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed because I was really happy to have an alternative to lotion, but now I don&#x27;t think I even want to try other powder sunscreens because I&#x27;m scared of getting another bad burn!</li>
            <li> I was hopeful this product would be the solution to my usual greasy sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Even so, it smelled so bad that I didn&#x27;t want to even try a second time.</li>
            <li> got dirty</li>
            <li> I now have a horrible burn on my shoulders and arms.</li>
            <li> Oh, and it also smelled horrible.</li>

            <li> The dispenser releases far too much powder, making it hard to apply to one&#x27;s face without creating a cloud of titanium dioxide powder.

            <li> I really wanted to like this product, but it is so incredibly messy and impossible to get the cap back on without getting powder everywhere (not to mention I felt like I was breathing in the powder with can&#x27;t be good for you).  It needs a better design, like a retractable brush or a sleeve that fits from the bottom up.  Overall I am planning to return this item because it did not work as I had planned.</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to shiny, oily sunblock lotions! Make sure to apply it in multiple directions and often to avoid sunburn though.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen. Bee Sunny protects me from getting a sunburn.  It is good for my skin, and doesn&#x27;t contain harmful chemicals.  It is light and lets my skin breathe.  The retractable brush makes the application easy!</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this product and bought one for me and my mom. The packaging is great, the applicator works well and is very convenient. One major problem- the sunscreen doesn&#x27;t work! I tried it once to walk the dog and got a minor burn. I thought I hadn&#x27;t applied enough, so I put a ton on and reapplied for a 2 hour hike. I now have a horrible burn on my shoulders and arms. I know it didn&#x27;t sweat off, because at the end of the hike, you could still see and feel the powder on my skin. Plus the burn is very even, it looks like I didn&#x27;t wear any sunscreen at all. I&#x27;m so disappointed because I was really happy to have an alternative to lotion, but now I don&#x27;t think I even want to try other powder sunscreens because I&#x27;m scared of getting another bad burn!</li>
            <li> Wow. I was hopeful this product would be the solution to my usual greasy sunscreen. I guess it was, because after using this I will happily apply my old lotion sunscreen. When I opened the container for my first application a bunch of powder spilled out of it. Also, it wasn&#x27;t translucent when I applied it. It was totally white. I looked like a ghost. Oh, and it also smelled horrible. Like skunk smell. I immediately washed off my stinky white mask and threw this product away. Maybe I didn&#x27;t apply it correctly? Even so, it smelled so bad that I didn&#x27;t want to even try a second time. What a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I love the fact I can easily apply this to my kids. It does come out a little too much so you have to spread upright in order to not have more sunscreen emptying out onto your child. Better than cream screens and love it&#x27;s physical so it&#x27;s won&#x27;t absorb! Great coverage and easy to re-apply!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a golfer so this is a super product to  reapply during a round of golf without get all greasy.</li>
            <li> this is awesome..i keep in my purse and use it when we are in the convertible or at games!!! its perfect to use on my hubbys face and top of head also!!!, no oil!!!</li>
            <li> i spend a lot of time outside in the summer and this is easy to reapply on the go.  it looks a little girly putting it on, but nothing gets in my eyes.  no smell to attract bugs and critters.  it is also very light and easy to carry in my pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;give it an A++ for improving on old style lotion sunblock.</li>
            <li> I love it.  It is easy to carry to the pool, and it isn&#x27;t messy.  It is very effective.  A great find.  We live in Florida&lt;br /&gt;year round, and are out in the sun daily.</li>
            <li> I like it. It is good for what I use it for. I wouldn&#x27;t use it at the beach or for a long period of time. It&#x27;s not translucent, it turns my skin white. I use it for tanning for 10 min so like I said, it&#x27;s good for whatnonuse it for.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen works fine.  The applicator doesn&#x27;t control the quantity at all, and the brush is such poor quality that it scratches and you end up with white patches all over your face. I ended up putting the sunscreen in an old mineral foundation container and use my own high quality powder brush to apply it.</li>

They certainly prefer it to being wiped down with conventional sunscreen and moms will appreciate not having their hands covered in greasy sunscreen after applying to the little ones. A great product for folks of all ages!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  Just pop it in your purse and go.  No more messy, greasy lotions.  Just a few brush strokes and you are covered.  Works really well on children, too!</li>
            <li> The Bee Sunny Sunscreen with retractable brush has become a \\&quot;must-have\\&quot; for me.  I am active outdoors and it goes in every pack from mountain biking, climbing to day and multi-day hikes.  It doesn&#x27;t drip into my eyes when I start sweating and it&#x27;s refillable!  The sun protection, which is ultimately the most important aspect of sunscreen, is phenomenal. Even on non-active days it is a great, translucent powder.</li>
            <li> Nice idea however product is vey white on skin &amp; lid falls off frequently product spilled in my purse &amp; brush got dirty</li>
            <li> We started buying this product over the summer. Everyone loves it!! My boys 4 and 6 can put on by themselves and have never burned!! You need to reapply every 2 hrs like all sunscreen. give it a try.</li>
            <li> I have been waiting for a product like this for a while.  I have fair skin and so does my daughter so i have to have sunblock on hand all the time.  I have lotions, liquids and aerosols.  I often use the aerosol on my daughter because it covers quickly and she can go play, but every time i tried putting a hat on her she takes it back off within 10 minutes.  I would spray her head but then it would make her hair look greasy.  So I bought this for the convenience of having a portable refillable non spilling container and the convenience of being able to apply it to her head and not worry about her hair getting gummy or greasy.  Well... It works.  But.  I am not sure if i am overapplying it or that the product is just like this, but it does leave a white coating ... it does not let her scalp burn which is the original reason why i bought it.  its a definite must to apply in a gridlike and swirling pattern.  I was out on a motorcycle ride and only had this product on hand and had to apply it to my arms and neck and swirled it on my face some too.  It worked.. i reapplied every two hours but i think it should have been every hour because i didnt fully burn but was still a little red.  So what i am trying to say is - good product, use as directed, beware that it may leave a white coating; Works great in toddler scalps.</li>
            <li> while the product may work well, the packaging does not. i used it today for the first time and the cap doesn&#x27;t stay on and the bottom unscrews way too easily-- all the powder dumped out onto my feet!  i don&#x27;t see why it is necessary to have access to remove the powder like that.  the similar peter thomas roth product has a much better design.</li>
            <li> I find the bristle stiff and not comfortable during application. It is also not easy to control the amount of powder. In short, I don&#x27;t like the refillable brush and rather use my own traditional brush. As to the sunscreen powder, I am not sure whether it really function the way it claims as I cannot bear the stiff bristle. I will get the powder out and use my own brush to see how good the sunscreen powder is.</li>
            <li> Not cheap but when you only have seconds before the kids run off to the slide/friends/swings etc, this is a dream. Also they don&#x27;t mind it going on as is not sticky. This means reapplication (which is required) is not difficult at all.</li>
