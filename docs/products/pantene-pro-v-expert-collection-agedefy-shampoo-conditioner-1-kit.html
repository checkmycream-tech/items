            <li>Love the way my hair feels after using it!  </li>
            <li>I liked the way it made my hair feel.</li>
            <li>and my hair is wonderfully shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>After shampooing my hair for the first time they felt great, i followed it on with a conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think that these Pantene Agedefy products are the next best thing I have found to take its place.</li>
            <li>I am in love with the shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I started to lose more hair-</li>
            <li>My hair has become more manageable almost like it was so many years ago.</li>
            <li>first time I shampooed my hair: My hair instantly became tangle free and the smell was delicious.</li>
            <li>Both the shampoo and the conditioner leave your hair terrifically conditioned and tangle free.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair look smooth and revitalized.  </li>
            <li>and my hair looked fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I also use the ADVANCED THICKENING TREATMENT and it works well too.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is a nice texture that glides, you don&#x27;t need to use too much.</li>
            <li>They are my new HG, beautiful hair without paying a high price.</li>
            <li>and I just have to try anything new :)</li>
            <li>After washing my hair my hair actually felt great, they looked and felt very soft to touch.</li>
            <li>I followed this with the serum (see review)&lt;br /&gt;OK so after using it few times my hair felt great</li>
            <li>Yes, my hair was drier, so appeared fuller, but the side-effects just aren&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>This product was great the first week or so, but after that, it really felt like it made my hair dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li>I have long hair past my waist, so I look for products that will have this kind of great conditioning affect.  </li>
            <li>Results after one use: sleek, but not limp, shiny, easy to style hair.</li>
            <li>I guess it is more white than gray</li>
            <li>I have not noticed any product build up,  yet my hair always feels silky, thick, has body and the dry fly aways and the static are gone.  </li>
            <li>My hair are pretty long (or should i say were- as I have had them cute since using the shampoo)</li>
            <li>It did exactly what I hoped it would do - It certainly improved the condition of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I like the product, really can&#x27;t comment on its effectiveness at this point.</li>
            <li>Great product for my thin post chemo/radiation hair.</li>
            <li>These products really do what they say.  </li>
            <li>admit this works better when paired with the AgeDefy serum but even on days when I have missed using that I have much less breakage</li>
            <li>THERE IS FOR OLDER PEOPLE</li>
            <li>I have always used high end hair and styling products</li>
            <li>and I have rarely achieved the same results as I have with the Agedefy Shampoo and Conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Ok so here it is a review after using it for over few months:&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner seemed to do its magic for few washes and then stopped working-</li>
            <li>Tried it, because it&#x27;s new</li>
            <li>, my straight fine hair felt very silky and thick.  </li>
            <li>Irony!)&lt;br /&gt;My journey for perfect shampoo and conditioner continues :(</li>
            <li>BUT.....&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion after using it for more than a month: The shampoo and conditioner seemed to have stopped working, it started to dry my hair out (considering I started to let my hair dry naturally and didn&#x27;t use hair iron)</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, thick but thinning with age, shoulder length straight bob cut, it would look good after washing and styling, but a few hours later it would usually look dull, limp, slightly dry, fly away and sometimes had static.  </li>
            <li>B007KNAA2S Argan Oil 100% Pure 2 oz.]], rub a tiny amount on my hands and run this through my hair.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft, not standing up in places.</li>
            <li>Agedefy, wow</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair, and I don&#x27;t feel that it worked well with my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft, thicker and fuller.  </li>
            <li>Soft and has body.</li>
            <li>However, conditioner fixed all of it and then some.</li>
            <li>As I have gotten older that has become an issue with breakage, so much so that I had handfuls of hair in the drain in the morning when using other shampoos meant for strengthening hair (Clear).  </li>
            <li>and :O</li>
            <li>When I first rinsed the shampoo off my hair felt thicker and slightly stiff, then I applied the conditioner</li>
            <li>This product has really improved the look and fullness not to mention that I see less hair in the shower.</li>
            <li>This left my hair feeling and looking thicker plus it is soft, not sticky or dry.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I used it on my hair and it was great. I have gray hair I guess it is more white than gray I get it colored. It has been excellent I liked the way it made my hair feel.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, fine hair.  As I have gotten older that has become an issue with breakage, so much so that I had handfuls of hair in the drain in the morning when using other shampoos meant for strengthening hair (Clear).  I thought this was just what I&#x27;d have to deal with until I found the AgeDefy product line.  Within 3 uses - 3!! - I had only a few strands of breakage in the shower compared to the amount I&#x27;d had just days before.  Amazing!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will admit this works better when paired with the AgeDefy serum but even on days when I have missed using that I have much less breakage and my hair is wonderfully shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> Both the shampoo and the conditioner leave your hair terrifically conditioned and tangle free.  I have long hair past my waist, so I look for products that will have this kind of great conditioning affect.  Buying the 2 products together in a box like this saves you quite a bit, too.  I have been using Wen, but it has been getting so expensive.  I think that these Pantene Agedefy products are the next best thing I have found to take its place.</li>
            <li> I like the product, really can&#x27;t comment on its effectiveness at this point.</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of different shampoo/conditioner. Good kit for the price. Leaves my hair soft, not standing up in places.</li>
            <li> BEST SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER THERE IS FOR OLDER PEOPLE</li>
            <li> Great product for my thin post chemo/radiation hair. This left my hair feeling and looking thicker plus it is soft, not sticky or dry. I&#x27;ve paid a lot more for expensive salon products that don&#x27;t do the job like this one does. Get the treatment too. It is wonderful.</li>
            <li> It did exactly what I hoped it would do - It certainly improved the condition of my hair.  Could not find it locally.</li>
            <li> I am in love with the shampoo and conditioner.  It makes my hair look smooth and revitalized.  Its great for hair over 40 for men and women.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dad. He said it works well or at least it feels like his hair is thickening. Great product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this kit for three weeks, my hair is beautiful.  My hair is fine, thick but thinning with age, shoulder length straight bob cut, it would look good after washing and styling, but a few hours later it would usually look dull, limp, slightly dry, fly away and sometimes had static.  Agedefy, wow what a difference.  When I first rinsed the shampoo off my hair felt thicker and slightly stiff, then I applied the conditioner, my straight fine hair felt very silky and thick.  I blow dried it and my hair looked fantastic.  I get the same results every time I wash my hair.  I have not noticed any product build up,  yet my hair always feels silky, thick, has body and the dry fly aways and the static are gone.  I have stopped using styling products, occasionally before bed I use a small amount of  [[ASIN:B007KNAA2S Argan Oil 100% Pure 2 oz.]], rub a tiny amount on my hands and run this through my hair.  I have always used high end hair and styling products and I have rarely achieved the same results as I have with the Agedefy Shampoo and Conditioner.  Everyday I feel like I have just walked out of a salon.  They are my new HG, beautiful hair without paying a high price.</li>
            <li> This product was great the first week or so, but after that, it really felt like it made my hair dry and frizzy. I have naturally wavy hair, and I don&#x27;t feel that it worked well with my hair.</li>
            <li> These are no better and no worse than any other shampoo and conditioner that I have used.  Not worth the premium price.</li>
            <li> These products really do what they say.  My hair feels soft, thicker and fuller.  I have thin hair and it was falling off alot.  This product has really improved the look and fullness not to mention that I see less hair in the shower.</li>
            <li> great product, makes hair feel thicker immediately. I also use the ADVANCED THICKENING TREATMENT and it works well too. I have used NIOXIN SYSTEM 1 and LOREAL VIVE PRO THICKENING  but they weren;t  as good.</li>
            <li> After only one use, the color on my &#x27;virgin&#x27; hair (roots) was GONE!  In addition, it totally &#x27;undid&#x27; my keratin treatment.  Yes, my hair was drier, so appeared fuller, but the side-effects just aren&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> Ok so here it is a review after using it for over few months:&lt;br /&gt;the first time I shampooed my hair: My hair instantly became tangle free and the smell was delicious. The shampoo is a nice texture that glides, you don&#x27;t need to use too much. My hair are pretty long (or should i say were- as I have had them cute since using the shampoo), I have lots of hair they are just not that thick, so i purchased all set (including the serum- see my serum review), for maximum results. After shampooing my hair for the first time they felt great, i followed it on with a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Conditioner: this is a very thick conditioner- again it smells beautiful- not very strong a bit flowery- reminds me a slight smell of baby shampoo. Again I didn&#x27;t have to use a lot, try not to use this on your roots but rather the length of your hair only. After washing my hair my hair actually felt great, they looked and felt very soft to touch. I followed this with the serum (see review)&lt;br /&gt;OK so after using it few times my hair felt great and I received compliments from my co worker who noticed my hair slightly thicker (joys of having a  baby!) BUT.....&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion after using it for more than a month: The shampoo and conditioner seemed to have stopped working, it started to dry my hair out (considering I started to let my hair dry naturally and didn&#x27;t use hair iron), it felt straw-ish like and :O i Started getting split ends. I would recommend this shampoo and conditioner ONLY for people who 1) have not colored their hair and 2) who have oily hair or dry hair and use other products to keep your hair less frizzy. This shampoo and conditioner seemed to do its magic for few washes and then stopped working- I started to lose more hair- so no it didn&#x27;t thicken my hair (Irony!)&lt;br /&gt;My journey for perfect shampoo and conditioner continues :(</li>
            <li> Love the way my hair feels after using it!  Soft and has body.</li>
            <li> Being a senior citizen my gray hair is thinning. I like the coating provided by this product. My hair has become more manageable almost like it was so many years ago. Thank you, Pantene!</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s coming from someone who is NOT a Pantene fan... Tried it, because it&#x27;s new and I just have to try anything new :) This blows the Nexxus Youth Renewal line out of the water. Both shampoo and conditioner have a little funky muddy color. Shampoo bubbled in my hard water (a bonus for me), however, hair did not feel slick and moisturized after shampoo, which raised a red flag. However, conditioner fixed all of it and then some. Results after one use: sleek, but not limp, shiny, easy to style hair. Does not have an annoying smell, just a light one. Point of reference: caucasian, my hair is fairly thin, some days limp, some days flyaways/poufy at the ends, no big damage issues, color - very slight ombre, did a rosehip oil mask before this particular shampoo.</li>
