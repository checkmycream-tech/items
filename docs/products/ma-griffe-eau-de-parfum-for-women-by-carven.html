            <li>I am thrilled that you still offer it.  </li>
            <li>I am delighted to find this perfume again, it was my favorite in the 70&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>with no hint of vanilla or rose.  </li>
            <li>Used Ma Griffey years ago and thought it would be nice to they again.  </li>
            <li>I was happy to find it through Amazon and it arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>I was delighted to find Ma Griffe available from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Maybe the original version would have been good, but users say this version is a reformulation.</li>
            <li>I got this as a gift and hoped to love it</li>
            <li>This is my wife&#x27;s favorite purfume.</li>
            <li>, i would love this if it wasn&#x27;t a bit cloying</li>
            <li>So while most things I buy on Amazon come within the week (or within 2 days)</li>
            <li>She used to wear this  fragrance many years ago and said she can&#x27;t find it in her area shops any longer.  </li>
            <li>I read somewhere that Carven changed its formula to make it better for more women.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It is my mother favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>My suggestion is, keep them as a &#x27;good memory&#x27;, and use good quality Essential Oils, instead.</li>
            <li>I wore Ma Griffe over 40 years ago (I&#x27;m old, LOL)</li>
            <li>I have not been able to find the original again.  </li>
            <li>and so was I to know that it could be ordered so easily.  </li>
            <li>this often takes 2 full weeks or more to arrive,  </li>
            <li>It was my fragrance of choice when I first met my husband 41 years ago and it is still lovely to wear.  </li>
            <li>Often you are required to special order this outstanding purfume at higher prices.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to find that the scent lasted much longer ....</li>
            <li>Light and fresh.  </li>
            <li>No bad surprises.</li>
            <li>I hope that it is always available for me.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>The perfume companies have been \\&quot;re-doing\\&quot; many of our long-time old favorites.....</li>
            <li>This is only a pale shadow of the wonderful original.</li>
            <li>Where &#x27;rose will always be rose, lavender will always be lavender, patchouli will always be patchouli, etc.&#x27;, in other words, they will be the same, over the years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s  hard to find,  so happy that Amazon stocks it.  </li>
            <li>I would have made the trip back to Paris to get it for sure.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Ma Griffe since I first bought it in Paris in 1966.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for making shopping on Amazon so productive and effortless!</li>
            <li>Many of my friends tried it and said it did not smell the same on them as it did on me.  </li>
            <li>it is the only perfume I can have, I love it</li>
            <li>Loved it then, do not love it now.  </li>
            <li>Although packaging looked new and fresh, the fragrance was not what I remember and I wonder if the product was &amp;#34;old&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Wife was so happy, Ma Griffe has been hard to find, she even found a new &amp;#34;back up&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Crisp and unsung Classic fragrance that has been around since 1946.</li>
            <li>Obviously I can&#x27;t open it to try it out, but I&#x27;m assuming it is the &#x27;real deal&#x27; and not some cheap knock-off.  </li>
            <li>&quot; It is unusual, in that it is not what \\&quot;everyone is wearing\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>senses of different shades though light and dark&lt;br /&gt;swirls</li>
            <li>I live in the tropical portion of the states and the climate requires a light but lasting fragrance...</li>
            <li>vibrantly like an Rousseau painting primal and&lt;br /&gt;instinctive</li>
            <li>Disappointed that they changed what used to be perfect.</li>
            <li>She was surprised</li>
            <li>The problem might be that the original did not fit all women.  </li>
            <li>Ma Griffe opens crisp and lush of Green Notes caresses</li>
            <li>She had received it several years back from an old family friend.  </li>
            <li>I wear this everyday,  it&#x27;s more a floral and green scent,  </li>

            <li> fragrance that she expected to receive as a Valentine gift.</li>
            <li> MY wife has been using this perfume for over 50 years, she loves it and won&#x27;t change, but it is getting harder to find.</li>

            <li> One I had sent to me and the other to my aunt in another state.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use heavy or smelly perfumes and this one is soft and delicate.</li>
            <li> I am counting on Amazon to continue to carry this purfume and save me the trouble of hunting all over town for it.</li>
            <li> from the surface the opening gives an&lt;br /&gt; impression of innocence and the green notes adds that&lt;br /&gt;metaphor</li>
            <li> Smell dissipates after just a few minutes of spraying on.</li>
            <li> I got few compliments.</li>
            <li> and it is either fake, or old and spoiled.  </li>
            <li> We had purchased the same brand for approximately 20 years with no problem.  </li>
            <li> It is a pale comparison</li>
            <li> This one was not good on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years and haven&#x27;t got tired of it yet.  </li>
            <li> I was unable to purchase it here and had to rely on family to bring it from France,  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it was off the market for quite sometime.</li>
            <li> Disappointing this time around.</li>

            <li> I keep trying to like Ma Griffe, but it just kind of grosses me out. I got this as a gift and hoped to love it but it is just not for me. Maybe the original version would have been good, but users say this version is a reformulation. I am wearing it now, just as a test and can&#x27;t wait to get in the shower and wash it off.</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite purfume. Hard to find at reasonable prices. Often you are required to special order this outstanding purfume at higher prices. I am counting on Amazon to continue to carry this purfume and save me the trouble of hunting all over town for it.</li>
            <li> This one was not good on my skin. I wanted to experience a \\&quot;cyphre\\&quot; It is unusual, in that it is not what \\&quot;everyone is wearing\\&quot;. I gave it away.</li>
            <li> Ma Griffe opens crisp and lush of Green Notes caresses&lt;br /&gt;your senses of different shades though light and dark&lt;br /&gt;swirls vibrantly like an Rousseau painting primal and&lt;br /&gt;instinctive from the surface the opening gives an&lt;br /&gt; impression of innocence and the green notes adds that&lt;br /&gt;metaphor as we walk further into the Ma Griffe Greenhouse&lt;br /&gt;the air becomes thicker and the floral becomes deeper&lt;br /&gt; The note of Peach steeps though the&lt;br /&gt;air like a sensual Verita; Rose adds an velvety touch&lt;br /&gt;to this dualistic scent Orris brings the earthy side&lt;br /&gt;and nocturnal jasmine closes the middle with an green&lt;br /&gt;herbal smell; The drydown turn Ma Griffe uninhibited&lt;br /&gt;and Primal; Labdanum with a mixture of Civet adds a&lt;br /&gt;Animalistic spirit Cinnamon brings depth and a bit&lt;br /&gt; of an edge;&lt;br /&gt; Watered musk dilutes the volume but noticible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ma Griffe dries to a dark and esoteric finish of&lt;br /&gt;styrax and dry sandalwood,This scent is a Chameleon&lt;br /&gt;crisp and green at the opening deep and reseinous&lt;br /&gt;drydown, i would love this if it wasn&#x27;t a bit cloying&lt;br /&gt;but still a nice perfume i would give this&lt;br /&gt;3 out of 5 Stars.</li>
            <li> When I visited Parish in 2007 with a friend, I asked family what they wanted me to bring back and my mom asked about Ma Griffe.  She had received it several years back from an old family friend.  When I came back from Paris, I presented it to her; She told me last year, she had very little left and while on Amazon, I just happened to type in Ma Griffe and decided to buy it for her.  She was surprised and so was I to know that it could be ordered so easily.  I would have made the trip back to Paris to get it for sure.  But I wanted her to have it now.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have been using Ma Griffe since I first bought it in Paris in 1966.  After returning to the USA I was unable to purchase it here and had to rely on family to bring it from France,  Then 2 or 3 years ago, I discovered it on Amazon.com!!!!!  I am thrilled that you still offer it.  Thank you, thank you!</li>
            <li> So glad to find this! Crisp and unsung Classic fragrance that has been around since 1946. Nouveau Moderne mid 20th century nostalgia. Citrusy, woodsy.</li>
            <li> No,no, no!!!  This is only a pale shadow of the wonderful original. And it only lasts about as long as a &#x27;splash&#x27;......   The perfume companies have been \\&quot;re-doing\\&quot; many of our long-time old favorites..... and they are very disappointing!!! They are Not the same.  Like your grandmother&#x27;s wonderful cooking, that you will never have again. My suggestion is, keep them as a &#x27;good memory&#x27;, and use good quality Essential Oils, instead. Where &#x27;rose will always be rose, lavender will always be lavender, patchouli will always be patchouli, etc.&#x27;, in other words, they will be the same, over the years. No bad surprises.</li>
            <li> I am delighted to find this perfume again, it was my favorite in the 70&#x27;s.Wearing this perfume is like rediscovering my youth,I am happy I found it.</li>
            <li> The fragrance did not meet expectations based on prior purchase. Smell dissipates after just a few minutes of spraying on. Disappointing this time around.</li>
            <li> Wife was so happy, Ma Griffe has been hard to find, she even found a new &amp;#34;back up&amp;#34; fragrance that she expected to receive as a Valentine gift. She was so happy!</li>
            <li> Perfect packaging. Fragrance just as I remembered it. I hope that it is always available for me.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> I wear this everyday,  it&#x27;s more a floral and green scent,  with no hint of vanilla or rose.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years and haven&#x27;t got tired of it yet.  It&#x27;s  hard to find,  so happy that Amazon stocks it.  I will say that the company who ship it take their time.  So while most things I buy on Amazon come within the week (or within 2 days) this often takes 2 full weeks or more to arrive,  so don&#x27;t wait till your bottle is empty before buying the next one.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend as a surprise for the Holidays.  She used to wear this  fragrance many years ago and said she can&#x27;t find it in her area shops any longer.  I was happy to find it through Amazon and it arrived quickly.  Obviously I can&#x27;t open it to try it out, but I&#x27;m assuming it is the &#x27;real deal&#x27; and not some cheap knock-off.  Thanks for making shopping on Amazon so productive and effortless!</li>
            <li> I live in the tropical portion of the states and the climate requires a light but lasting fragrance...when paired with a tube of ma griffe perfumed body lotion by Carven,  [[ASIN:B0020MMCGG Ma Griffe by Carven for Women Body Lotion, 5-Ounce]]  I was pleased to find that the scent lasted much longer ....</li>
            <li> I placed two orders for this product.  One I had sent to me and the other to my aunt in another state.  Both arrived on time and in great condition.</li>
            <li> The scent is just what I can handle. I can&#x27;t use heavy or smelly perfumes and this one is soft and delicate. I got few compliments.</li>
            <li> Although packaging looked new and fresh, the fragrance was not what I remember and I wonder if the product was &amp;#34;old&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have just received a bottle of the above ma griffe and it isn&#x27;t at all like the one that I used to wear.  It is a pale comparison and I am very disappointed.  Are there no originals left?</li>
            <li> I used MaGriffe in the 70&#x27;s and just loved the scent. Unfortunately, it was off the market for quite sometime. When I discoverd it again, I immediately purchased it. Hope this items stays a long time. It is just wonderful!!!</li>
            <li> MY wife has been using this perfume for over 50 years, she loves it and won&#x27;t change, but it is getting harder to find.</li>
            <li> I wore Ma Griffe over 40 years ago (I&#x27;m old, LOL) and I loved it.  I have not been able to find the original again.  The problem might be that the original did not fit all women.  Many of my friends tried it and said it did not smell the same on them as it did on me.  I read somewhere that Carven changed its formula to make it better for more women.  Loved it then, do not love it now.  Changed to Chanel No. 5.</li>
            <li> I was delighted to find Ma Griffe available from Amazon.  It was my fragrance of choice when I first met my husband 41 years ago and it is still lovely to wear.  Light and fresh.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Used Ma Griffey years ago and thought it would be nice to they again.  Love it.</li>
            <li> It is my mother favorite perfume. And is very difficult to find.</li>
            <li> it is the only perfume I can have, I love it&lt;br /&gt;I can´t get it in norway&lt;br /&gt;xxxx xxxxx xxxxxxxx</li>
            <li> Ordered and received just before Christmas 2012.  My sweetie just started using it and it is either fake, or old and spoiled.  It smells nothing like it should and is offensive to the nose.  We had purchased the same brand for approximately 20 years with no problem.  Tried to return on Amazon, but the website only says it is a gas or flammable and cannot be returned. DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> Disappointed that they changed what used to be perfect.</li>
