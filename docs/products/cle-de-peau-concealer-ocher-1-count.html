            <li>THIS IS WORTH EVERY PENNY!!  </li>
            <li>This concealer is totally worth a try!!</li>
            <li>“Fast shipping Excellent seller Strongly recommend it Thanks.”</li>
            <li>It does feel great upon applying soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Does not apply easily at all.</li>
            <li>FYI, I&#x27;m 45 with the fine line syndrome.</li>
            <li>I have light skin.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light, you can&#x27;t feel it when it&#x27;s on, and it goes on creamy and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Smooth texture.</li>
            <li>Covers so smooth and well</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t sink into my fine lines, not cakes, blends super easy.</li>
            <li>Worth the price!</li>
            <li>At first i thought it was too light,  but what it was,  was the fact that this concealer is also light reflective.  </li>
            <li>I was VERY VERY hesitant to spend that much on a concealer!!!  </li>
            <li>This is my new favorite product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d much rather find a cheap foundation.</li>
            <li>but on me it doesn&#x27;t last nicely.</li>
            <li>It still useful for the areas for coverage.</li>
            <li>This is by far, my favorite.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>The light weight feel and long lasting staying power is great for all day wear</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot!</li>
            <li>The first night I had used it I got complements from a waitress at a restaurant asking if I used a highlighter to do contouring.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many many other concealers at all different prices.</li>
            <li>i will still use my Cle De Peau for certain times.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really pigmented.  </li>
            <li>It really brightens and lifts.  </li>
            <li>I REALLY didn&#x27;t want to like this concealer or the foundation just because of price alone.</li>
            <li>The only other one that I really liked was by dermablend</li>
            <li>Normal ish skin.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m so grateful that I finally did because it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth as silk and a little bit covers so much.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t even look like I&#x27;m wearing anything, totally natural!</li>
            <li>do not waste your funds on this product</li>
            <li>Holy crap, this concealer is the best yet.  </li>
            <li>Use it primarily in the inner corners and slightly below.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m hooked on this stick, and it seems that it doesn&#x27;t take much so it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>but it is only good for random spot touch ups</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hides dark circles very very well</li>
            <li>Now cover girl  makes a decent cover up (the normal black tube one)</li>
            <li>but it is very expensive and really doesn&#x27;t do any better than Revlon.</li>

            <li> Too dry  -  </li>
            <li> it is the only one I have ever found to cover dark circles and scars.</li>
            <li> Finally broke down and got it.  </li>
            <li> So up to you I tried it even if I was super expensive</li>
            <li> so I only need like a little swipe under each eye</li>
            <li> and I use it everyday for under eyes and red spots.</li>
            <li> other reviewers too</li>
            <li> Does not get feel heavy or make your face feel dry.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and dark under eyes.</li>
            <li> It covers really dark circles.  </li>
            <li> It is moist, covers dark circles and lasts all day</li>
            <li> Will last at least 6 months</li>
            <li> I am a product junkie with dark circles under my eyes all my life.  </li>
            <li> stopped wearing it -  not worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Meaning my nose is always slightly pink/red a lot.</li>
            <li> use with a little bit of moisturizer and every dark circle or blemish is covered.</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey</li>
            <li> Oh n no fine line settling either.</li>
            <li> Pale even.</li>
            <li> Seriously ladies....</li>
            <li> But anyway, it covers without looking cakes or fake.</li>
            <li> too expensive for this paste.</li>
            <li> Hate that.</li>
            <li> just hate it&#x27;s pricey</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product and even better price.</li>
            <li> I like the coverage after use but it doesn&#x27;t last all day as everybody claims.. It does feel great upon applying soft and smooth. But after a while it falls into the creases of your skin. I tried setting it with a powder, still doesn&#x27;t last. I have oily skin too but other reviewers too but on me it doesn&#x27;t last nicely. I take good care of my under eyes its a pet peeve, but genetics happen. I have oily skin and dark under eyes. Your better off using amazing cosmetics and its affordable or I also like my Laura Mercier concealer. So up to you I tried it even if I was super expensive i will still use my Cle De Peau for certain times. It still useful for the areas for coverage.</li>
            <li> Holy crap, this concealer is the best yet.  It covers really dark circles.  It&#x27;s really pigmented.  Blends like a dream.  I have light skin.  Pale even. I got the ivory.  It works great.  At first i thought it was too light,  but what it was,  was the fact that this concealer is also light reflective.  Which is one of the reasons it works so well.  It really brightens and lifts.  It&#x27;s better then thradiant creamy radiant concealer. And i love love love my nars concealer.  Sometimes i use both.  When i contour for a night out.</li>
            <li> “Fast shipping Excellent seller Strongly recommend it Thanks.”</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of concealers over the years. This is by far, my favorite. Worth the price! It is moist, covers dark circles and lasts all day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a product junkie...especially for makeup. This is BY FAR the best concealer I have EVER tried in my life. I was VERY VERY hesitant to spend that much on a concealer!!!  Finally broke down and got it.  Seriously ladies....the best concealer out there. I don&#x27;t have any connections to the company to sell the product....just a girl who when she finds something good...likes to share it!  You guys won&#x27;t use any other...trust me. As for choosing the color...I just guessed so be sure to buy it from a place that has a good exchange policy.  The color I chose was ocher and it fit me perfectly. I&#x27;m fair/medium colored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YOU WILL LOVE THIS!!!</li>
            <li> Great coverage.  Will last at least 6 months and I use it everyday for under eyes and red spots. Pam</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t sink into my fine lines, not cakes, blends super easy. I&#x27;m in love with this. Like the care em foundation, this is hella pricey. I&#x27;d much rather find a cheap foundation. I literally tried em all. Now cover girl  makes a decent cover up (the normal black tube one) but it is only good for random spot touch ups (in my opinion). I REALLY didn&#x27;t want to like this concealer or the foundation just because of price alone. But this goes on and spreads well so I only need like a little swipe under each eye n it&#x27;s perfect. I noticed they it does well covering up nose discoloration. Meaning my nose is always slightly pink/red a lot. Hate that. But anyway, it covers without looking cakes or fake. It doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m wearing a ton of foundation or concealer. Ik thins is lengthy but when I review so etching, I like to review it thoroughly. Especially cosmetics n hair care. FYI, I&#x27;m 45 with the fine line syndrome. Normal ish skin. Tone issues bit ya know I deal. Oh n no fine line settling either. Hope this helps. Ramble ramble. Lol</li>
            <li> great product, no delivery issues. thank you!</li>
            <li> I am a product junkie with dark circles under my eyes all my life.  I have left no stone unturned in the hunt for the perfect concealer.  Cle de peau is the best I have found. It took me a while to give in and dole out that kind of money but I&#x27;m so grateful that I finally did because it&#x27;s worth every penny. It goes on smooth as silk and a little bit covers so much. It doesn&#x27;t even look like I&#x27;m wearing anything, totally natural! I purchased ocher ....I&#x27;m medium skin toned. This is my new favorite product.</li>
            <li> I love this concealer it is the only one I have ever found to cover dark circles and scars. The light weight feel and long lasting staying power is great for all day wear</li>
            <li> Perfect!!! So Worth the money!!!!</li>
            <li> I give thus product thumbs up. Good coverage and the color matches well. Long lasting.</li>
            <li> i love this concealer.  i looked up the best concealer on the market today on line and this one kept coming up at the top of the list. that&#x27;s why i decided to give it a try.  the votes for it were 100% correct.  it&#x27;s light, you can&#x27;t feel it when it&#x27;s on, and it goes on creamy and smooth.  there is no drying involved in it either.  it&#x27;s great for touch ups.  i&#x27;m hooked on this stick, and it seems that it doesn&#x27;t take much so it lasts a long time.  a must have!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite go-to products ever.  It goes on creamy and stays put all day long.  No scent.</li>
            <li> Best concealer on market. use with a little bit of moisturizer and every dark circle or blemish is covered. Make sure to get correct color.</li>
            <li> Best coverage I&#x27;ve found for darkness around the eyes.  Use it primarily in the inner corners and slightly below.  Go to concealer for years.</li>
            <li> I really liked this concealer.  The shade matches my skin perfectly, the formula is smooth and very easy to blend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but so is Revlon photo concealer and its a lot cheaper. I liked it but it is very expensive and really doesn&#x27;t do any better than Revlon.</li>
            <li> I saw this product on Pinterest and decided to try it. The coverage is great. Smooth texture. Does not get feel heavy or make your face feel dry. It is a little pricey but I do love it.</li>
            <li> too expensive for this paste. Does not apply easily at all. Not as advertised. do not waste your funds on this product</li>
            <li> Great item. Used this for several years and would definitely purchase again from this vendor. Thanks a lot! Five Stars all around!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and I&#x27;ve tried many brands...this is so easy to use and good coverage.</li>
            <li> Too dry  -  stopped wearing it -  not worth the cost.</li>
            <li> THIS IS WORTH EVERY PENNY!!  Covers so smooth and well with no deposit in creases around eye&lt;br /&gt;Hides dark circles very very well</li>
            <li> This concealer has been the best! It&#x27;s worth the money. The first night I had used it I got complements from a waitress at a restaurant asking if I used a highlighter to do contouring. It stays in place. I&#x27;ve tried many many other concealers at all different prices. The only other one that I really liked was by dermablend and they discontinued it. This concealer is totally worth a try!! Love it just hate it&#x27;s pricey</li>
