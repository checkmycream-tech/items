    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>:-D</li>
            <li>The lalique encre noir I ordered though is the best for me</li>
            <li>Excellent service!</li>
            <li>This is the best scent for men.  </li>
            <li>all wonderful.  </li>
            <li>On time delivery and a very good price.</li>
            <li>Great product, price and delivery.</li>
            <li>It is really a great fragrance though</li>
            <li>What a great scent.</li>
            <li>Amazon, good job again.</li>
            <li>That being said, it&#x27;s a good cologne for the price.  </li>
            <li>The product I received appears to be genuine and in excellent condition.  </li>
            <li>or I would not have ordered it, but you should try it yourself and form your own opinion as to whether it’s a good match for you.</li>
            <li>I timely got the product at a nice price.</li>
            <li>Excellent, a strong and long-lasting woodsy/herbal scent, yet with the certain underlying sophistication Guerlain excels in.</li>
            <li>I like this even more because Arnold Schwarzenegger wears it</li>
            <li>(I believe this has been reformulated) but I really love this scent a lot.</li>
            <li>More than three sprays is probably gonna gas people out of the room.</li>
            <li>suggest you make sure that the product you are ordering is the one you want because you will not be able to return, even the unopened packages.</li>
            <li>Simply put, the best!</li>
            <li>I love Guerlain Imperial though and will stick with that scent.</li>
            <li>I have always liked the clean and citrusy fragrance of Guerlain&#x27;s Vetiver.</li>
            <li>It was delivered when promised, which was much earlier than originally suggested, and in excellent condition.</li>
            <li>While many people like this cologne, it makes you smell like you smoke a cigarette or cigar or were in a smoke filled room.</li>
            <li>The products are excited and I&#x27;m fully satisfied.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comment on projection bit I have heard you should probably go easy on the trigger with this one.</li>
            <li>This stuff is a classic, and with good reason.  </li>
            <li>The best summer perfume a real man can put on himself early in the morning after a shower, it is so refreshing, uplifting and energising, love it, love it, this is probably the most natural scent I had ever smelled so far.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t tell you how this compares to the original formula</li>
            <li>it seems that the scent is not fresh---as though it has lost its strength and unique smell---it is not the scent i remember.</li>
            <li>This is a review of the Guerlain Vetiver Eau De Toilette Spray for Men as sold by Amazon (not a third-party vendor) August 2014, and focuses only on whether the product was genuine and in good condition.  </li>
            <li>It is bright and invigorating, with sharp citrus springing up just before a crisp vetiver with a nice amount of bite.  </li>
            <li>Sure, it might not be as &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;accessible&amp;#34; as Aqua di Gio (no hate toward ADG, mind you), but this is a smooth, classy vetiver that pulls off an old-world charm without being stuffy.  </li>
            <li>To me it just kind of has a citrusy, earthy, grassy vibe with a bit of that old school barber shop feel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like many of the modern fragrances out there which is why I like it.</li>
            <li>Obviously I think it’s a good product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li>THANKS!!</li>
            <li>It is subtile and fresh.</li>
            <li>Vetiver is worth a sniff.</li>
            <li>G. vetiver smells great,clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Package came a day early (before vacation) and I was able to fully enjoy this classic sailing across the sea.</li>
            <li>it is just dark, woodsy and I never thought a burning smell could be so pleasant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy another bottle of it in the future, unless another scent comes along that I like more.</li>
            <li>I wear this purim since my first date.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>If you want to try something a bit different from most of the newer stuff out there</li>
            <li>Not a traditional cologne for a man; however, makes it all the more desirable.</li>
            <li>I hear it is the bomb the cool classy one.</li>
            <li>On my skin it seems to have pretty decent longevity too.</li>
            <li>I really like this smell.</li>
            <li>I know some people that really don&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li>Thanks again for impressing me.</li>
            <li>Too much money for what seems like an &#x27;after shave&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>I am very</li>
            <li>Sharp, crisp, clean scent.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I decided to make a blind purchase on this because of the great reviews I have seen both here on Amazon and by the fragrance community.</li>
            <li>I only wear this when working out or when I just wanna have a spicy fresh smell to me after I get out of the shower and am going to go outdoors.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s much less of the sharp vetiver scent a lot more of a somewhat floral undertone.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is not a review of the quality of the product generally.  </li>
            <li>It is not nearly as pungent as some of its modern counterparts (e.g., Encre Noire), but vetiver definitely is the star of the show, and it makes its presence known.  </li>
            <li>Subtle and yet strong  </li>
            <li>It is a formal kind of scent the guerlain is every day dress casual scent.</li>
            <li>Very blah and the vetiver lays low; the other cheap-smelling ingredients take</li>
            <li>but then I have some people that say it&#x27;s good or doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a fresh soapy smell which doesn&#x27;t make me personally feel gross or sick.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a little stronger than an after shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been some time since I last used this, so I could be remembering it wrong.  </li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said, anyone that used this cologne back in the day may be a little disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I would say it lasts at least 8 hours for me.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not AMAZING.</li>
            <li> I was nervous that the product may be counterfeit or stale, but that was not the case here; everything was correct.  </li>

            <li> I really like this smell. It&#x27;s not bad but it&#x27;s not AMAZING. I know some people that really don&#x27;t like it but then I have some people that say it&#x27;s good or doesn&#x27;t smell bad. It&#x27;s a fresh soapy smell which doesn&#x27;t make me personally feel gross or sick. I only wear this when working out or when I just wanna have a spicy fresh smell to me after I get out of the shower and am going to go outdoors. I like this even more because Arnold Schwarzenegger wears it :-D Which motivates me when it&#x27;s on. If you can sample it do so. This is definitely different than I had expected. I&#x27;d buy another bottle of it in the future, unless another scent comes along that I like more.</li>
            <li> Great product, price and delivery.</li>
            <li> I wear this purim since my first date. I have compliment on the sent from everybody. It is subtile and fresh. The price is unbelievable:&lt;br /&gt;It is more expensive at the duty-free shop at the Paris airport!</li>
            <li> I decided to make a blind purchase on this because of the great reviews I have seen both here on Amazon and by the fragrance community. I am admittedly no fragrance expert and I can&#x27;t tell you how this compares to the original formula (I believe this has been reformulated) but I really love this scent a lot.

            <li> Amazon, good job again.G. vetiver smells great,clean and fresh.The lalique encre noir I ordered though is the best for me it is just dark, woodsy and I never thought a burning smell could be so pleasant. It is a formal kind of scent the guerlain is every day dress casual scent. I would not wear it to the swimming pool,thats what the bulgari aquas are for. Thanks again for impressing me. I cant wait to get my YSL la nuit frozen from you I hear it is the bomb the cool classy one.</li>
            <li> Too much money for what seems like an &#x27;after shave&#x27;.  I thought it would be a little stronger than an after shave.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said, anyone that used this cologne back in the day may be a little disappointed.  It&#x27;s not the fragrance a remember.

            <li> This is not the product i have used over the years and now Amazon says I cannot return even the package I did not open.&lt;br /&gt;I suggest you make sure that the product you are ordering is the one you want because you will not be able to return, even the unopened packages.</li>
            <li> Excellent, a strong and long-lasting woodsy/herbal scent, yet with the certain underlying sophistication Guerlain excels in. It was delivered when promised, which was much earlier than originally suggested, and in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> I have been a user of Vetiver for over 50 years..It&#x27;s the only cologne I use.. Simply put, the best!</li>
            <li> What a great scent. Package came a day early (before vacation) and I was able to fully enjoy this classic sailing across the sea.</li>
            <li> Sharp, crisp, clean scent. Imagine your suited up grandfather leaving the barbershop after a wet shave.</li>
            <li> it seems that the scent is not fresh---as though it has lost its strength and unique smell---it is not the scent i remember.</li>
            <li> Pres. Kennedy wore this.  Subtle and yet strong  renders compliments.... Thank you for helping get this!</li>
            <li> This is a review of the Guerlain Vetiver Eau De Toilette Spray for Men as sold by Amazon (not a third-party vendor) August 2014, and focuses only on whether the product was genuine and in good condition.

            <li> Everything worked out as programmed. I timely got the product at a nice price. Excellent service!</li>
            <li> The products are excited and I&#x27;m fully satisfied.</li>
            <li> I am a lady who enjoys the scent of vetiver.  When I read women also like this scent, I decided to try it.  It is not for me; I don&#x27;t find the smell unisex. I don&#x27;t even like it for a man. Very blah and the vetiver lays low; the other cheap-smelling ingredients take over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love Guerlain products but they missed the mark on this one.</li>
            <li> This is the best scent for men.  It is fresh and does not get &#x27;stale&#x27; like other scents, even the next day.  On time delivery and a very good price.</li>
            <li> I have always liked the clean and citrusy fragrance of Guerlain&#x27;s Vetiver. It keeps on meeting my expectations.</li>
            <li> Everybody likes this scent!</li>
            <li> fragrance, pricing and delivery!!  all wonderful.  THANKS!!</li>
            <li> Not a traditional cologne for a man; however, makes it all the more desirable. I like! Of course each man and her woman wear a cologne and smell a cologne differently.</li>
            <li> While many people like this cologne, it makes you smell like you smoke a cigarette or cigar or were in a smoke filled room. I love Guerlain Imperial though and will stick with that scent.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a classic, and with good reason.  Sure, it might not be as &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;accessible&amp;#34; as Aqua di Gio (no hate toward ADG, mind you), but this is a smooth, classy vetiver that pulls off an old-world charm without being stuffy.
