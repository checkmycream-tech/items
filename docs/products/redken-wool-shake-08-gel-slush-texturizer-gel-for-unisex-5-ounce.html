            <li>I have very fine hair and this product actually &amp;#34;plumps&amp;#34; the hair and gives it great body.</li>
            <li>I hope Redken continues producing this interesting and unique product.</li>
            <li>Instead of fighting my frizzy, fine hair I am going to go with the flow, in fact, make it curlier while increasing the volume.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair.  </li>

            <li>Great for keeping the curl in your hair I use it when hair is wet out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and lasts long, making it economical to boot.  </li>
            <li>Still a good find overall.</li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t enough good things to say about this product and for the life of me</li>
            <li>The stickiness went away quickly and the hardness softened some but it wasn&#x27;t like I wanted anyone running his fingers through it.  </li>
            <li>It has the hold of a super gel without the stickyness and plastic feel and will hold for 2 days.</li>
            <li>super product-heard they are not making this anymore.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not really unpleasant.  </li>
            <li>Then just as the insanely small print on the bottle directs, I shook that goofy stuff up and gave my hair a good coating.  </li>
            <li>Product came exactly as stated from seller !</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>It is fine and predominately straight.  </li>
            <li>Every pomade, gel, paste even \\&quot;hair clay\\&quot; is basically some kind of grease and quickly turn my hair flat and greasy.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to think of a hair product called wool shake-gel slush, so was pleasantly surprised when received it.</li>
            <li>Awesome product for people with thin hair.</li>
            <li>It works better than anything I have used as far as mousse and Gel.</li>
            <li>It pulls all of your hair together beautifully and my wedge looks like years past.</li>
            <li>I think it is worth the price for what it does for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Ordered right away</li>
            <li>My favorite hair product for my limp, fine hair!</li>
            <li>Great on my fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li>Kind of oricey, but lasts a long time!</li>
            <li>But those brush right out and allow me an extra day without washing, so I love it.</li>
            <li>The effect was exactly as desired</li>
            <li>Exactly what I have wanted and hopefully, I can purchase more later.  </li>
            <li>I have never used anything else since I first tried it.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, only product that does exactly what I need.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different products from gels, mousses, texturizing putty, and every brand of hair spray imaginable.  </li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>The smell is ok, but a little strong at first.</li>
            <li>This product helped me to discover a whole new dimension to my normally stubbornly straight and fine hair with a few rogue pieces around my face that have minds of their own.  </li>
            <li>and it certainly does add volume to your hair.  </li>
            <li>Great for a little extra style when I go with</li>
            <li>i put a little of this in the ends just to make my curls more distinct.</li>
            <li>You can end up with the Bad-Witch-Of-The-West look if you use too much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never seen anything that could create as much volume as this stuff.</li>
            <li>My change in  philosophy is thanks to this</li>
            <li>Really holds my hair in place.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>This is very dissapointing.</li>
            <li>It makes styling my hair so much easier.</li>
            <li>I always have them ready to go just in case</li>
            <li>It is an absolute must have for people with very fine limp hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll NEVER understand why they discontinued it, but not only does it work AMAZING in every single way - it smells</li>
            <li>the natural curly or straight looks...</li>
            <li>(mostly air dried with a couple minutes with the blow dryer to finish the job)  </li>
            <li>and now I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>My wife uses this stuff and she says she can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>Each time I received this product it said they were new</li>
            <li>I pretty much only use it when I am wearing my hair curly.  </li>
            <li>Maybe the other 2 bottles I ordered at the same time will be more like the product I found elsewhere.</li>
            <li>When I opened the product I was surprised there was no plastic on the bottle showing that it&#x27;s a new product, but hey sometimes products don&#x27;t come like that.</li>
            <li>Even with fine, long, unlayered hair that stuff did its job and kept doing it all night long.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use much, but you instantly can tell a difference in the texture of your hair.</li>
            <li>I use this wool shake for my natural curly hair.  </li>
            <li>but I think that adds to the natural look.</li>
            <li>Product was old and had dehydrated...seller should not have been selling.</li>
            <li>I tried this product on my medium length, naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Have used for several months now and really like this product</li>
            <li>I only shampoo every other day and am so pleased that even the second day, Wool Shake still works.</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend it for anyone looking for extra volume; especially if you have fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, which I love.  </li>
            <li>It was super thick, straight as can be - one stylist even asked if I ironed it - and had an abundance of body.</li>
            <li>I use hairspray afterwards to hold it in place, but wouldn&#x27;t be necessary if you don&#x27;t normally use a spray.  </li>
            <li>It gives my layers a fun texture look that lasts  without being heavy like waxes are.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way; more is not better--it works like glue and too much ends up a sticky unattractive mess that can only be fixed with a wash and starting all over.</li>
            <li>I love the extra volume it gives hair, you can use a lot or a little but just a little goes a long way.</li>

            <li> Maybe the other 2 bottles I ordered at the same time will be more like the product I found elsewhere.</li>
            <li> When I opened the product I was surprised there was no plastic on the bottle showing that it&#x27;s a new product, but hey sometimes products don&#x27;t come like that.</li>
            <li> Even with fine, long, unlayered hair that stuff did its job and kept doing it all night long.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use much, but you instantly can tell a difference in the texture of your hair.</li>
            <li> I use this wool shake for my natural curly hair.  </li>
            <li> but I think that adds to the natural look.</li>
            <li> Product was old and had dehydrated...seller should not have been selling.</li>
            <li> I tried this product on my medium length, naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Have used for several months now and really like this product</li>
            <li> I only shampoo every other day and am so pleased that even the second day, Wool Shake still works.</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend it for anyone looking for extra volume; especially if you have fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, which I love.  </li>
            <li> It was super thick, straight as can be - one stylist even asked if I ironed it - and had an abundance of body.</li>
            <li> I use hairspray afterwards to hold it in place, but wouldn&#x27;t be necessary if you don&#x27;t normally use a spray.  </li>
            <li> It gives my layers a fun texture look that lasts  without being heavy like waxes are.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way; more is not better--it works like glue and too much ends up a sticky unattractive mess that can only be fixed with a wash and starting all over.</li>
            <li> I love the extra volume it gives hair, you can use a lot or a little but just a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I towel dried and lifted small sections and sprayed lightly all over my damp head, close to the roots.</li>
            <li> 5 ounces doesn&#x27;t last nearly long enough!</li>
            <li> Long lasting hold</li>
            <li> /&gt;Granted, after it is initially applied to freshly washed and towel dried hair the results are suspect but give it just a few minutes while working your hair with your fingers.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t drench your hair with it at first - start slow.  </li>
            <li> EXCEPT initially it felt very sticky and hard.  </li>
            <li> And doesn&#x27;t make your hair flat!</li>
            <li> It smells kind of bad when I spray it, but I don&#x27;t notice it throughout the day.</li>
            <li> so I had to do without it for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, fine hair with no body at all.  </li>
            <li> so looking down meant the problem bangs, and they can only be so short.</li>
            <li> as a dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It may fells a sticky putting it on when your hair is dry you can finger comb to loosen if you like.</li>
            <li> The last few years, a couple of weird waves developed near the back of my neck and the body all but vanished.</li>
            <li> I like Redken products and decided to try this on WET hair instead of dry.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff - too bad they stopped making it.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I wish I could get a larger size than 5oz.</li>
            <li> Minimal if any blow drying on \\&quot;Cool\\&quot; setting.</li>
            <li> It gives you a ton of controlled, non-frizzy volume with minimal product used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way as well.</li>
            <li> To be clear, LOVE the product, just very sad that I could not get it!!!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it leaves some hair hard--unlike the Tigi Beach Spray.</li>
            <li> I have long (past the shoulder blades), one-length hair.  </li>
            <li> I suspect that some one watered down these bottles to sell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Why not pay less when you can?</li>
            <li> I used to buy it through a beauty salon for less that thirty dollars.....</li>
            <li> but when they arrived, they were not full and the caps did not have seals on them as in the stores.</li>
            <li> I have never liked ANY dry shampoo, but this works to take the shine off if you want to go out to breakfast without washing your hair.  </li>
            <li> Just spray a little on your hair and style.</li>
            <li> This one little bottle does it all for me.  </li>
            <li> It looks a little messy too</li>
            <li> The only negative is it seems to dull my (colored) hair a bit,</li>
            <li> When I started to inspect my newly recieved product I noticed that close to half a bottle was missing and the spritzer was somewhat dirty with product like someone has previously used the spritzer.</li>
            <li> I washed and dried my hair.  </li>
            <li> Not as heavy as a wax and your hands don&#x27;t get all goopy</li>
            <li> I received a bottle that was dented, no wrap on the cap, a bit dried up product on the label, and it was watery.</li>
            <li> so this makes my hair look like a perfectly messy ponytail.</li>
            <li> A few decades ago, I had dream hair.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s not too heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t wash it everyday.</li>
            <li> Texturizing limp hair opens up style options that just plain did not exist before.</li>
            <li> I use it usually when I curl my hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like a slick pony</li>
            <li> The type of the bottle is so small</li>
            <li> This is hard to find in stores anymore or salons in the area.</li>
            <li> Now...you aren&#x27;t going to want to run your fingers through it,  as there are hard spots under the surface.  </li>
            <li> I have really thick curly/wavy hair</li>
            <li> A very small amount accomplishes a look that that I would otherwise need tropical humidity, salt water and a lot of time fussing to achieve--uniform texture and waviness.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, ordered this from 2 different sellers and they were both unable to fulfill the order.  </li>
            <li> My hairdresser has tired of me complaining about my \\&quot;brillo pad\\&quot; hair in the Illinois humidity.  </li>
            <li> Hate to run out of it on my short style hair.</li>
            <li> I am so sad the brand discontinued the product.</li>
            <li> Sad it is being discontinued.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately seems as if it is discontinued.</li>
            <li> Too bad Redken has changed it from a spray to a paste/cream in a jar.  </li>
            <li> I am so disappointed that it is being discontinued.</li>
            <li> So sad!!!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My all time favorite hair product. I am so sad the brand discontinued the product.</li>
            <li> The best hair product I have found, shame they discontinued it.</li>
            <li> Great styling product to add extra va-va-voom to curly hair. Great texturizer and makes hair look bigger and fuller. Thoroughly recommend it. Product came exactly as stated from seller !</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to think of a hair product called wool shake-gel slush, so was pleasantly surprised when received it. It works well to add volume to my layered hair. The smell is ok, but a little strong at first. My only complaint is that it leaves some hair hard--unlike the Tigi Beach Spray. Still a good find overall.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, ordered this from 2 different sellers and they were both unable to fulfill the order.  So sad!!!  To be clear, LOVE the product, just very sad that I could not get it!!!</li>
            <li> I love Wool Shake . . . it separates the hair strands well.  I use hairspray afterwards to hold it in place, but wouldn&#x27;t be necessary if you don&#x27;t normally use a spray.  My only wish is that it came in a bigger bottle.  5 ounces doesn&#x27;t last nearly long enough!</li>
            <li> I use it instead of any hair spray.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! It is an absolute must have for people with very fine limp hair. You don&#x27;t need to use much, but you instantly can tell a difference in the texture of your hair. You lightly spray wet/damp hair and then style. I used to use 4+ products on my hair to try to get it do do ANYTHING. Now it&#x27;s just Wool Shake and finishing hairspray. Texturizing limp hair opens up style options that just plain did not exist before. And it lasts ALL DAY! For those folks with hair like mine, you know what a big deal this is. My only complaint is that I wish I could get a larger size than 5oz. I go through this stuff like water and would appreciate a price break on larger sizes or refill options.</li>
            <li> I was torn between this and Fekkai&#x27;s Creating Waves but I chose the Wool Shake.  I have long (past the shoulder blades), one-length hair.  It is fine and predominately straight.  Pieces at the nape of my neck have wave - go figure!  I was looking for some piecey waves all over and boy did I get them!      I washed and dried my hair.  (mostly air dried with a couple minutes with the blow dryer to finish the job)  Then just as the insanely small print on the bottle directs, I shook that goofy stuff up and gave my hair a good coating.  I scrunched as I went.  It waved-up immediately!  The effect was exactly as desired EXCEPT initially it felt very sticky and hard.  The stickiness went away quickly and the hardness softened some but it wasn&#x27;t like I wanted anyone running his fingers through it.  It has a kind of potent smell but it&#x27;s not really unpleasant.  It&#x27;s a salon-like smell.      BOTTOM LINE:  Even with fine, long, unlayered hair that stuff did its job and kept doing it all night long.  Even in Florida&#x27;s 100% humidity.  No frizz-up or anything.  TIP:  Don&#x27;t drench your hair with it at first - start slow.  You can always add more to areas you think need more wave or \\&quot;texture\\&quot; as they call it now.  You can end up with the Bad-Witch-Of-The-West look if you use too much.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for! It gives my side-swoop bangs the look I needed. &#x3D;) My salon turned me onto it..and now I can&#x27;t live without it. &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> Awesome product for people with thin hair. I&#x27;ve never seen anything that could create as much volume as this stuff.</li>
            <li> I use it to give volume to my hair.  It gives my hair  more texture and  more volume.  I love it</li>
            <li> My hairdresser has tired of me complaining about my \\&quot;brillo pad\\&quot; hair in the Illinois humidity.  Instead of fighting my frizzy, fine hair I am going to go with the flow, in fact, make it curlier while increasing the volume.  My change in  philosophy is thanks to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, after it is initially applied to freshly washed and towel dried hair the results are suspect but give it just a few minutes while working your hair with your fingers. Minimal if any blow drying on \\&quot;Cool\\&quot; setting. It gives you a ton of controlled, non-frizzy volume with minimal product used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hello waves and curls, goodbye frizz!</li>
            <li> I have used this for years! Hate to run out of it on my short style hair. Nice Amazon sells it.</li>
            <li> My hair salon quit carrying this product so I had to do without it for a long time. Then Imwent online &amp; was happy to find it. I will never have to do without it again !!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and my salon discontinued it - so glad to find it here!  Not as heavy as a wax and your hands don&#x27;t get all goopy - wish I could order it in bulk on case it goes away!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair.  It works wonderfully. It gives me a good amount of volume that holds through the day.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Gives great texture for my chin length fine hair. Sad it is being discontinued. Kind of oricey, but lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> The product I received was not the same as the Wool Shake I used to buy at the salon.  Redken quit producing Wool Shake, and every place I went was out of it. I thought maybe someone still had some to sell on Amazon, so I chanced it. I received a bottle that was dented, no wrap on the cap, a bit dried up product on the label, and it was watery. I suspect that some one watered down these bottles to sell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hairdresser says that Redken does not allow its products to be sold online, such as through Amazon.  The agreement he seller signs doesn&#x27;t allow it, and would be a breach of contract if they sell online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY REDKEN PRODUCTS ONLINE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I learned my lesson.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff!  It creates the perfect beachy waves with little to no effort.  A little goes a long way as well.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I have wanted and hopefully, I can purchase more later.  This is hard to find in stores anymore or salons in the area.</li>
            <li> If u are looking for a product to make your layers more piecy and give u that beachy texture, then this is the product for u!  Just in time for summer!</li>
            <li> I like this a volumizer.......aaaaand......as a dry shampoo.  I have never liked ANY dry shampoo, but this works to take the shine off if you want to go out to breakfast without washing your hair.  Makes your hair voluminous and matte.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It gives my layers a fun texture look that lasts  without being heavy like waxes are. Can&#x27;t believe they quit making it!!</li>
            <li> Best hair gel spray ever</li>
            <li> this is a excellent product for keeping your hair in place. spray move your hair around &amp; go. love it!!!</li>
            <li> I use this wool shake for my natural curly hair.  When I am defusing it I spray it on my hair to help hold it like a gel.  It works better than anything I have used as far as mousse and Gel.</li>
            <li> I never received it as Redken stopped making it!! I&#x27;m now using Guts 10 an am satisfied!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in here but I love it, it does the work of 3 styling products. I use it usually when I curl my hair. It gives good hold while giving this matte, natural  and textured look. It looks a little messy too but I think that adds to the natural look. I just spray all around my hair, shake my curls, and add some hairspray for extra hold. I also use it when I put my hair up. I spray on the roots to give it texture... I don&#x27;t like a slick pony so this makes my hair look like a perfectly messy ponytail.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Really holds my hair in place. Unfortunately seems as if it is discontinued. The product that has replaced it is not as good. Wish they would bring it back.</li>
            <li> Great for keeping the curl in your hair I use it when hair is wet out of the shower.  It may fells a sticky putting it on when your hair is dry you can finger comb to loosen if you like.</li>
            <li> I use this as a root lifter for fine hair, it is AWESOME!! And doesn&#x27;t make your hair flat! I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My wife uses this stuff and she says she can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Great for adding texture to your hair.  Told my hair dresser about it, she is carrying it and can&#x27;t keep it on the shelf.</li>
            <li> This product adds ultra texture to your hair.  I pretty much only use it when I am wearing my hair curly.  You can&#x27;t run your fingers through your hair with this product, but that is ok.  It smells good too.</li>
            <li> The product I recieved was used. When I opened the product I was surprised there was no plastic on the bottle showing that it&#x27;s a new product, but hey sometimes products don&#x27;t come like that. When I started to inspect my newly recieved product I noticed that close to half a bottle was missing and the spritzer was somewhat dirty with product like someone has previously used the spritzer. This is very dissapointing.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I have found that adds volume and thickness to my hair without grease. Every pomade, gel, paste even \\&quot;hair clay\\&quot; is basically some kind of grease and quickly turn my hair flat and greasy. This stuff is so awesome. I have never used anything else since I first tried it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful....why oh why is this product discontinued 😰.</li>
            <li> Product was old and had dehydrated...seller should not have been selling.</li>
            <li> A few decades ago, I had dream hair. It was super thick, straight as can be - one stylist even asked if I ironed it - and had an abundance of body. The last few years, a couple of weird waves developed near the back of my neck and the body all but vanished. I&#x27;ve worn a modified wedge cut to help hold the shape, but increasingly, the bangs fell forward no matter what. I&#x27;m an artist/editor, so looking down meant the problem bangs, and they can only be so short. I like Redken products and decided to try this on WET hair instead of dry. The type of the bottle is so small I couldn&#x27;t read it anyway, even with a magnifying loope. I towel dried and lifted small sections and sprayed lightly all over my damp head, close to the roots. This stuff is amazing. It pulls all of your hair together beautifully and my wedge looks like years past. Best of all, the bangs stay put and they aren&#x27;t starched or goofy. I only shampoo every other day and am so pleased that even the second day, Wool Shake still works. The only negative is it seems to dull my (colored) hair a bit, so I use the Redken shine hairspray. I no longer need a foam mousse for all over, a cream straightener for the neck waves, and gel for the bangs. Perfect product!! I&#x27;d give it more stars if I could.</li>
            <li> it was a gift for someone</li>
            <li> I am beyond upset that Redken discontinued this product. That&#x27;s why I came onto Amazon and bought five bottles! I&#x27;m almost out, and I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do when they&#x27;re all gone! Please, please, please, Redken--bring back Wool Shake!!!</li>
            <li> This product helped me to discover a whole new dimension to my normally stubbornly straight and fine hair with a few rogue pieces around my face that have minds of their own.  A very small amount accomplishes a look that that I would otherwise need tropical humidity, salt water and a lot of time fussing to achieve--uniform texture and waviness.  It&#x27;s great for days that I don&#x27;t have the time or desire to finish a more polished look and straighten those rogue pieces but still want to look put-together.  A little goes a long way; more is not better--it works like glue and too much ends up a sticky unattractive mess that can only be fixed with a wash and starting all over. Smells great and lasts long, making it economical to boot.  I hope Redken continues producing this interesting and unique product.</li>
            <li> I found no difference between this and the bottles I have purchased at a salon. Why not pay less when you can?</li>
            <li> I tried this product on my medium length, naturally curly hair.  I wasn&#x27;t very impressed with the look or feel, but really didn&#x27;t care for the smell.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Great on my fine, thin hair.  It smells kind of bad when I spray it, but I don&#x27;t notice it throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with it</li>
            <li> The most amazing product ever! Also doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy, so you can keep adding to the style 2 days later.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff - too bad they stopped making it.</li>
            <li> Heard about this product from a celebrity on a KY Derby interview.  Ordered right away and it certainly does add volume to your hair.  Now...you aren&#x27;t going to want to run your fingers through it,  as there are hard spots under the surface.  But those brush right out and allow me an extra day without washing, so I love it.</li>
            <li> Each time I received this product it said they were new but when they arrived, they were not full and the caps did not have seals on them as in the stores.</li>
            <li> If you want texture, you have it with Wool Shake.  Too bad Redken has changed it from a spray to a paste/cream in a jar.  I love this stuff and will continue to order it where I can get it.</li>
            <li> This did not smell like the product from my salon nor did it feel the same in my hair.  Maybe the other 2 bottles I ordered at the same time will be more like the product I found elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and this product actually &amp;#34;plumps&amp;#34; the hair and gives it great body. It has the hold of a super gel without the stickyness and plastic feel and will hold for 2 days. This has become one of the &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; items for me.</li>
            <li> I love this product but it too expensive to continue to buy it here.  I used to buy it through a beauty salon for less that thirty dollars.....Jamie menkhaus</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, only product that does exactly what I need. I can only find this online. I so hope they don&#x27;t stop making it.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product. After it was discontinued, I knew I&#x27;d be able to find on amazon. Great for a little extra style when I go with the natural curly or straight looks... And it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. Just spray a little on your hair and style. your done. I am so disappointed that it is being discontinued. I hope amazon will still carry this.</li>
            <li> Great product - wish it wasn&#x27;t discontinued</li>
            <li> My favorite hair product for my limp, fine hair!</li>
            <li> Great product. I love the extra volume it gives hair, you can use a lot or a little but just a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> They are discontinuing this product which is unfortunate because its my favorite.  It makes styling my hair so much easier.</li>
            <li> great product item has been discontinued from Redken</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t enough good things to say about this product and for the life of me I&#x27;ll NEVER understand why they discontinued it, but not only does it work AMAZING in every single way - it smells DIVINE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m planning on stocking up on this before its gone forever!</li>
            <li> Love the product. Been using it for years. Hope it stays in stock.  I have three more in my closet. I always have them ready to go just in case I have to wait a while for them. Watch the prices on amazon. You can be taken by some sellers</li>
            <li> super product-heard they are not making this anymore.  So glad I found it on your website.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  I have very thin, fine hair with no body at all.  Wool Shake 08 gel-slush texturizer is amazing in that it gives me body, hold and texture with just one product.  A little goes a long way, which I love.  I have tried many different products from gels, mousses, texturizing putty, and every brand of hair spray imaginable.  This one little bottle does it all for me.  I think it is worth the price for what it does for my hair.  I would strongly recommend it for anyone looking for extra volume; especially if you have fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li> Long lasting hold that&#x27;s not too heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> I have really thick curly/wavy hair and I don&#x27;t wash it everyday. On days I don&#x27;t wash my hair i put a little of this in the ends just to make my curls more distinct. I really like it!</li>
            <li> Have used for several months now and really like this product</li>
