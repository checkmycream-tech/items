            <li>Good product&lt;</li>
            <li>sure it&#x27;s a great product but is not what is advertised.</li>

            <li>I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I love Zakia&#x27;s shea and argan butter.</li>
            <li>and I just love the way my skin feels.  </li>
            <li>I will be looking for more products from this company.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair and skin looks great all day long.</li>
            <li>Also, the argan oil makes it easier to handle when softing, just a quick rub</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for everyday, stretch marks</li>

            <li>so far the product is ok.</li>
            <li>It mixes well with other oils &amp; butters :-)  :-)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the right balance between Shea Butter and Argan Oil.</li>

            <li>I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>It was a good product, just not big enough jar.</li>
            <li>Tends to run really greasy.</li>
            <li>But with the argan oil included it was a reasonable amount and price.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s ready to use.</li>
            <li>and I love to use it after I get a little too much sun.</li>
            <li>Like this product very much really soften my dry skin, just wish it wasn&#x27;t so hard you have to let it soften up in warm water to apply smooth.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with this product and certainly won&#x27;t be my last.  </li>
            <li>I thought that the product was going to be larger, other than that I am pleased.</li>
            <li>It would weigh your hair down &amp; make your scalp super greasy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clean and not filled with extra junk.</li>
            <li>It really helps to relieve skin conditions and helps to remove dark spots.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m definitely going to be a long time customer.</li>
            <li> use it for my dry skin and hair</li>
            <li> Although the label says for hair &amp; skin, short of melting this down, I see no way to use this on your hair.</li>
            <li> I also apply it to my hair either when wet or dry.</li>
            <li> My completion has improved and I have less hair breakage compared to the regular Shea butter I used before this product.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Only a small amount is needed.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> The butter is way too thick gritty.</li>
            <li> It is hard to use this as a body lotion as it is very thick almost hard and does not melt quickly on the skin.</li>
            <li> I added it to my homemade deodorant and replaced half of the coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Upset the bottle was broken and scooped the cream out into a different container.  </li>
            <li> Really softened my dry skin during this brutal winter, when nothing else could.  </li>
            <li> This product keeps me moisturized all day with a small drop.</li>
            <li> It is hard, chunky and hard to manage.  </li>
            <li> They are hard to find.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had VERY dry skin for years from using the wrong products.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

            <li> This product is amazing. It&#x27;s the right balance between Shea Butter and Argan Oil. I use it daily on my skin. The best part is the ingredients... It&#x27;s clean and not filled with extra junk. It&#x27;s great for everyday, stretch marks and I love to use it after I get a little too much sun. It nourishes the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had VERY dry skin for years from using the wrong products. This product keeps me moisturized all day with a small drop. A little goes a long way. I&#x27;m definitely going to be a long time customer. Thank you.</li>

            <li> It was a good product, just not big enough jar. But with the argan oil included it was a reasonable amount and price.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It comes as a solid and you have to warm (melt) it in your hand before applying.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for this at all. It is hard, chunky and hard to manage.  Once you get it somewhat softened, it isn&#x27;t pleasant.  So disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product. It is a bit grainy but melts readily when applied to skin and absorbs quickly. I like the combination of shea butter with argan oil. I look forward to seeing how it does in winter.</li>
            <li> I love Zakia&#x27;s shea and argan butter. It is not greasy once applied. It has helped to keep my fingers from cracking this winter. I also apply it to my hair either when wet or dry. Only a small amount is needed. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> It is hard to use this as a body lotion as it is very thick almost hard and does not melt quickly on the skin.</li>
            <li> The best one I&#x27;ve found</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  Really softened my dry skin during this brutal winter, when nothing else could.  I use it from head to toe.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I used this as a hair conditioner and a skin lotion and had great results. I am trying to use &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; products, products without chemicals. They are hard to find. But this shea butter is just shea butter and argan oil. Nothing else. I&#x27;d totally buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with this product and certainly won&#x27;t be my last.  I&#x27;m using it as an ingredient in my lotion bars and I just love the way my skin feels.  I will be looking for more products from this company.&lt;br /&gt;Jeannette Patocskai</li>
            <li> This product works well.  It really helps to relieve skin conditions and helps to remove dark spots.</li>
            <li> [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a great product but is not what is advertised.</li>
            <li> I use it as a pre-wash deep conditioner.  It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I have use it on my face and hair with great results. My completion has improved and I have less hair breakage compared to the regular Shea butter I used before this product.
