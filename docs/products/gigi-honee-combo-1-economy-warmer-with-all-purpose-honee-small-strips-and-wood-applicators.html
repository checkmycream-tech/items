            <li>Perfect compact size&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>

            <li>Good luck, and happy waxing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy i bought it.</li>
            <li>and it still works great.</li>
            <li>This is a great, money-saving set.  </li>

            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great kit to have at home, saves me a lot of money.</li>
            <li>All easy-peasy &amp; great.</li>
            <li>One brow went great.</li>
            <li>Warmer works great.  </li>
            <li>I laughed and laughed!</li>
            <li>Both very effective.</li>
            <li>It takes a while to heat the wax up, but is very good at keeping it warm once it&#x27;s melted.</li>
            <li>It successfully removed some hair</li>
            <li>They are quite handy!</li>
            <li>The strings of the wax kind of got over on my brow, and wham-o!</li>
            <li>Success!!!!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t hurt at all when I waxed my legs, a combo of good wax and my legs being used to it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m good now.</li>
            <li>Good size for home use.</li>
            <li>Get some baby powder for prepping the area and baby oil for residue removal, and you are good to go.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a good price</li>
            <li>/&gt;Aside from the wax container issues, I liked this wax warmer and felt like it was a great value.</li>
            <li>Good product for the size and price.</li>
            <li>the warmer is good</li>
            <li>I recieved everything for a great price and is very easy to use</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the warmer and the wax.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>ONCE AGAIN, I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE PRODUCT AS WELL AS THE SPEEDINESS OF SHIPPING OF PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>I got this kit to wax my eyebrows and armpits and it does a great job, much better results than going to salon</li>
            <li>Transaction went very smooth!</li>
            <li>But for everyone that does the right steps this wax is awesome...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the warmer itself if very nice</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS!</li>
            <li>I had items on-hand that made this process more salon-esque and efficient, and I would like to share them with you all!  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re going to love this product!</li>
            <li>I love my Gigi Wax warmer!</li>
            <li>This shipped to me very quickly and It is just great...</li>
            <li>On the bright side if I ever tour Europe I have a wax warmer that will work :)</li>
            <li>She was thrilled after she found what the kit included.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using pre-waxed strips that you warm in your hand before applying.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nice and spreadable.</li>
            <li>I had to go buy and cut my own fabric to use.</li>
            <li>Takes about 30 mins for the wax to be completely warm</li>
            <li>I will be saving hundreds of dollars by having my own.</li>
            <li>TAKES ABOUT 1/2 HOUR TO WARM UP THE WAX</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know how effective this will be.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice.  </li>
            <li>It warms up quickly and does a really great job</li>
            <li>This is the best product so far that has worked for me!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very good at getting all of the hairs off, but if it&#x27;s cooled too much, it won&#x27;t come off.</li>
            <li>The warmer keeps wax warm throughout the process, and the muslin strips are much better than the paper ones.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best to apply directly to your body AFTER all waxing is done and rub off with a washcloth that you can throw away  5.</li>
            <li>Overall I am happy with the product and happy</li>
            <li>Loved it , sticky but just use mineral or baby oil to clean up</li>
            <li>The warmer is great, didn&#x27;t take much time at all to warm the wax, and it seems to be well made.</li>
            <li>But it did arrive very fast which was great</li>
            <li>;) happy waxing</li>
            <li>This is a great product for home use with a temp control so it won&#x27;t get too hot.</li>
            <li>Got the package quickly,  I did have to buy thicker applicators and strips separately.. but def a good buy..</li>
            <li>when I tried the &#x27;melt in the microwave&#x27; wax and he was happy doing it until he had to use the large muslin strips</li>
            <li>I started with drugstore brands (Sally Hansen) which were alright, but this kit is MUCH better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great kit at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Just set it at &#x27;medium&#x27; and wait an hour and wax away :).</li>
            <li>I think you&#x27;ll enjoy it also!</li>
            <li>Wax heated up nicely and evenly smooth.</li>
            <li>love it love it</li>
            <li>: I LOVE the warmer.</li>
            <li>Much better then paying someone else to do it.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>This wax is WAY better than any of the sugar based wax products that I have used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>And honestly, you&#x27;re going to have to fiddle around with it to find what you&#x27;re comfortable with.</li>
            <li>i really love doing waxing.</li>
            <li>i wish it came with more muslins.</li>
            <li>but I love not having to go to a salon to get my eyebrows waxed.</li>
            <li>We just get it out every two weeks or so and about 5 minutes later he has perfect eyebrows.     </li>
            <li>Besides that, though, I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this item and so does my family.</li>
            <li>THIS REALLY WORKS GREAT.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you take all precautions to prep the area correctly.  </li>
            <li>I cannot count how many times I have used it instead of go to the salon.</li>
            <li>OK.</li>
            <li>This is OK.</li>
            <li>just make sure that your pot is NEVER tipped during non-use.  </li>
            <li>This product is ok, for the money.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to sell a product here, make sure your customers don&#x27;t have to be bilingual!&lt;br /&gt;Part</li>
            <li>Recommend to find better wax to use.</li>
            <li>I saw this at a salon and am glad I got a quality one.</li>
            <li>works great was easy to use even for me a first time user.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t right much good about the actually product except it looks very good.</li>
            <li>The first one lasted many, many years and saved me tons of money!  </li>
            <li>Great product easy to use no mess.</li>
            <li>heats up very nicely and delivers a wax that looks professionally done</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s convenient, easy to set up and use.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use.</li>
            <li>The wax warmer is compact and I can easily hid it when I&#x27;m done with it.</li>
            <li>This makes for easy cleanup and a disposal site for your used applicators (you want to change the applicators out every so often to prevent germs from getting into your wax)  4.</li>
            <li>Easy to prepare.  </li>
            <li>The wax is fine</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very impressed with the temp of the wax (not too hot) and the low cost.</li>
            <li>First of all, let me say that I have only once waxed my legs  before with my best friend</li>
            <li>The wax provided lasts years and the strips are cheap and easy to find at beauty stores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the cheap wax kits from the grocery store, with iffy results.</li>
            <li>I love it worth the money, I  haven&#x27;t paid in over year for my brows</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it is pain free</li>
            <li>The wax machine is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Very sticky, but quite effective.  </li>
            <li>This is a great wax system, especially for beginner self-waxers like myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great when you forget and need a wax last minute.</li>
            <li>Does a fantastic job on my mustache.  </li>
            <li>the machine and honey wax are good as any professional will use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than this, I found it effective and it is so nice to be able to do it whenever I want.</li>
            <li>this was exactly what I was looking for!!</li>
            <li>overall very very nice product.</li>
            <li>Not so great on the beard type hairs on my chin but will take out the long fine ones that grow there.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It was easy to use and set up and took about 20-30 minutes for the wax to warm completely.</li>
            <li>I am pretty pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I am really excited about this wax.</li>
            <li>Upon opening the box, I&#x27;m excited to see that all the supplies are for your FACE.</li>
            <li>The small strips and applicators are perfect for the eyebrow and lip area.</li>
            <li>wax worked well and grabbed most of the hairs the first time around, some of the missed hairs could have just been from my inexperience versus the wax.</li>
            <li>More detailed information about the items being sold would have saved everyone much time, effort and money.  </li>
            <li>I love having my own personal waxing machine to use it wherever I want.</li>
            <li>Always clean eyebrows.</li>
            <li>It has the third prong on the plug, so it&#x27;s \\&quot;grounded\\&quot;, which I wasn&#x27;t expecting, but that&#x27;s a pleasant surprise</li>
            <li>Never use without the special powder that you apply under wax.  </li>
            <li>My fault entirely, but its a good tip for newbies.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s been there much longer than that too.</li>
            <li>I shopped around and this looked good enough to get the job done.</li>
            <li>I got 2 full leg waxes out of 1 tub of wax.</li>
            <li>and it takes 20 strips for a full leg wax.</li>
            <li>I love it and it is so much quicker and safer than warming wax up in the microwave.</li>
            <li>wax warms up quickly and maintains even heat</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for the girl who&#x27;s not afraid to put hot wax on her own face and doesn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money going to the salon to have someone else do it for her everytime.</li>
            <li>It does get very hot</li>
            <li>Great investment if your brow game is strong!</li>
            <li>I find this amazing because after three days I always see hair coming back - even if I waited a month to let my eyebrows grow out and wax them.</li>
            <li>You can get the same results in the comfort of your own home.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice because it has different temperature settings.</li>
            <li>Its definitely worth the money and pays itself off.</li>
            <li>The sleeve provided is REALLY USEFUL.</li>
            <li>did purchase the dusting powder, pre and post lotion, which I would recommend - definately worth the money.</li>
            <li>and it was worth every penny.    </li>
            <li>After decades of going to a salon to get a lip wax, I can finally do it myself in the comfort of my own home.</li>
            <li>Wax works just as good as when i spent 10 dollars a week getting my eyebrows waxed!</li>
            <li>The sticks and strips, however, are ONLY suitable for eyebrow waxing.</li>
            <li>The warmer and wax are great but the wood applicators and muslin strips are the small size for bikini zone (and assuming since the kit came with all purpose wax you&#x27;re using for all leg as I was)  </li>
            <li>You can heat the wax to slightly running consistency and it will still do a good job.</li>
            <li>The wax is pretty good - takes about half hour to heat up.</li>
            <li>Package arrived prior to &amp;#34;deliver date&amp;#34; and it is just as described - the wax is very sticky, be sure and let the entire container warm up and not just the edges (</li>
            <li>If you are using this wax kit for facial waxing then that would be fine, but I do full leg waxes.</li>
            <li>I tried it first to see how if it worked.  </li>
            <li>Microwaving wax means that it doesn&#x27;t stay warm long, so I really wanted to get a warmer.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also ok for underarm waxing, but I would recommend having someone help you - you literally need a third hand to wax your armpits!</li>
            <li>The first time someone knocked this over at my house and it was all sticky.</li>
            <li>I just used this for the first time today so to test</li>
            <li>Used my wax warmer for the first time tonight and wish I&#x27;d purchased one years ago.      </li>
            <li>This is not a joke I have talked to several people that love this wax but the first couple times they didn&#x27;t dust themselves well enough and the wax took the top layer of skin as well as the hair...</li>
            <li>THANKS!</li>
            <li>works great and will def last for a long time.</li>
            <li>So i used this product for the first time in about 2 years and it didnt do no wonders.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The strips were the perfect size for the face area (brows, lip, etc), but again they would be too small for larger areas of application.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Wax heats up fast!</li>
            <li>This was my first time to try waxing.</li>
            <li>I toned first.</li>
            <li>Not so much!</li>
            <li>My hair grows in several directions, I have fine and course hair and in between all in one spot plus sensitive skin (read:not easy to wax).</li>
            <li>but I prefer different wax because it is very runny and hard to use but warmer works at perfect temperatures.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d seen a few reviews mention that, so I was prepared and had larger strips at home - old torn-up bedsheets work great!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really just warm to the touch if heated correctly not hot.</li>
            <li>This kit has pretty much all you need.</li>
            <li>this purchase will certainly make it less of a chore - glad I went for it!</li>
            <li>Am looking to get the large muslin roll</li>
            <li>Takes forever to warm up and it was a sticky mess</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have suggested I lightly dusted my skin with baby powder rather than buying the special powder.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair above my lip</li>
            <li>Many of these items are already around your house (I only purchased GENERIC baby oil for $1 at the local Fred Meyer) and make the process SO EASY!  </li>
            <li>I used a large blush brush, worked really well.</li>
            <li>We have the whole line of products there too, but none of them ever really get used except the wax off, but that&#x27;s easily replaced at home, so you don&#x27;t really neeeeed all the lotions and stuff, unless you&#x27;re going to actually use this for a salon and want to look fancy.</li>
            <li>If you turn the temp to High, the wax gets too hot and will not come off of the face like it should.</li>
            <li>I was really nervous about this purchase.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really afford to go out and get waxed</li>
            <li>As the wax gets lower you don&#x27;t need as much heat.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the wax.</li>
            <li>it is VERY sticky.</li>
            <li>And if you dont get yourself ready with the pre waxing and the dusting then when u rip off the wax you will be ripping off skin too...</li>
            <li>IT prevents the wax from spilling around and making the whole place messy&lt;br</li>
            <li>My eyebrows hurt so much from trying to do this twice</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really like the honee wax</li>
            <li>the was goes on much smoother.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the muslin strips that come included because the wax seeps through and makes your hands or gloves all sticky.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t heat the wax very well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>At home waxing is so easy with this product that contained all the products needed, wax strips only lasted me a few weeks easy enough to order more</li>
            <li>Great product, will last a long time, and definitely will save tons of money at the salon.</li>
            <li>You will definitely get your moneys worth out of it!</li>
            <li>The down side is you really have to use all your Gigi lotion packs on your face when waxing with this wax and make sure u dust yourself very well before you put this wax on ANYWHERE...</li>
            <li>Baby Oil - Use to clean up spills on the floor, or unwanted wax left on your face, legs, or chacha.</li>
            <li>and I have to turn it off once I get started and then back on again if it gets too cool.</li>
            <li>but there are too many choices in this country to settle for less than what I thought I was buying.  </li>
            <li>Also, I didnt let the wax get hot enough the first time I used it</li>
            <li>Just make sure you buy extra tape if you&#x27;re doing a man&#x27;s back.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the honey wax, it&#x27;s too sticky and messy, however it all came just as expected and the rest of the materials are great.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Point being, maybe getting your eyebrows done by a profesional is worth it, especially if you don&#x27;t have a steady hand.  </li>
            <li>THIS WILL PAY FOR ITSELF IN JUST A FEW MORE USES.  </li>
            <li>However, if you&#x27;ve missed a spot and can&#x27;t get the wax off an area with a larger strip, these little ones make for great clean up and grab all the small bits of wax.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to waxing, and figured I would do it at home.  </li>
            <li>so I just ordered a new one</li>
            <li>we had to just purchase a new pot.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my purchase, except that the strips are too small to do my legs and wish they had included some of the bigger strips.</li>
            <li>Small strips are great - I think the applicators are a little too long and thin, I prefer short and stubby popsicle sticks for the best amount of control.   </li>
            <li>I picked up some disposable table cloths to lay underneath me next time because I still have wax stuck to my tile floor from the first time</li>
            <li>I feel the low setting is still a bit too hot</li>
            <li>The cord is 6 feet long, which is pretty decent.</li>
            <li>, that was gone easily, I have a few course hairs on my chin.</li>
            <li>This is the same exact product that the professional salons use.</li>
            <li>B000WFEH02 GIGI Large Wooden Spatulas -</li>
            <li>husband was amazing and helped with the back of my legs, I had to ask for help while in a comprimising position after I realized it would be impossible to get it on my own as I do not have bionic powers and am not double jointed (to his dismay)</li>
            <li>First of all, I am not a professional, I use this for home use.</li>
            <li>Took about an hour for the wax to liquefy completely; then turned it to medium.  </li>
            <li>&amp; [[ASIN:B0002YH3PY GIGI Natural Muslin Roll]]).</li>
            <li>I just wish I could find a natural wax with sugar instead of this \\&quot;honee\\&quot; wax that does not wash off your skin</li>
            <li>Soothing Lotion - For use after waxing is complete and any residue is removed by baby oil  </li>
            <li>so I order the chocolate wax instead because I have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I really wish the canister was designed differently so that my issue doesn&#x27;t happen again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Use old towels or rags you don&#x27;t care about.</li>
            <li>which was what I kept reminding myself when I would get a little too excited and drip wax.   </li>
            <li>The ONLY thing is that the lid does not exactly stay on securely</li>
            <li>If you are clumsy and drop wax around, it is a real pain to clean it.</li>
            <li>do recommended turning it on high for the first 20-30min then turning it down to M  and stirring it frequently, it takes a while to melt the wax evenly</li>
            <li>But next time, I&#x27;m letting a pro do my brows, that is, if it grows back! ;-)</li>
            <li>I think this wax is a good quality and does well on my thick dark hair.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a high quality heater and it comes with everything you need to get started waxing.</li>
            <li>I wish there was a temperature setting here and not just high - low.</li>
            <li>I was extremely nervous to us a hot wax</li>
            <li>No regrets!</li>
            <li>Always keep it up right and don&#x27;t get any wax on the sides of it or you will have a heck of a mess</li>
            <li>, it wasn&#x27;t I can not never expected.</li>
            <li>The honee wax is really sticky so be careful not to get it on anything, and if you do, use baby oil to remove it.</li>
            <li>Had this waxier for years and it finally died on me so bought a new one differently recommend for those who want to wax at home!</li>
            <li>She thought at first that she&#x27;d have to buy the actual wax and some other stuff.</li>
            <li>I cleaned up the small areas of wax residue by pressing the muslin quickly against them and pulling.  </li>
            <li>I was very worried that it is not as professional or heavy duty as it looks.</li>
            <li>biggest complaint is there are two pamphlets of detailed instructions..and neither are in ENGLISH!</li>
            <li>When I first tried opening it, the wax was firmly stuck to the lid.</li>
            <li>course it can be messy, it&#x27;s hot wax.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I would suggest is making sure you put paper or something down where you are working as the wax is hard to remove from surfaces.</li>
            <li>They are thin and they break easily and they don&#x27;t hold enough amount of wax on it</li>
            <li>Very unhappy as it came with plug not for U.S&lt;br /&gt;Adjusting up one star as I was taken care of my customer service who helped me locate an adapter for a great price.</li>
            <li>None of the stinging I got with the cold strips and hair removal is way more complete!  </li>
            <li>Due to other reviews of the wax being messy I laid out old newspaper everywhere for clean up</li>
            <li>Although other reviewers complained about the stickiness (and they are correct), its easy to remove with any kitchen oil product (olive oil, sunflower oil).</li>

            <li> Good luck, and happy waxing!</li>

            <li> All easy-peasy &amp; great.</li>
            <li> One brow went great.</li>
            <li> Warmer works great.  </li>
            <li> I laughed and laughed!</li>
            <li> Both very effective.</li>
            <li> It takes a while to heat the wax up, but is very good at keeping it warm once it&#x27;s melted.</li>
            <li> It successfully removed some hair</li>
            <li> They are quite handy!</li>
            <li> The strings of the wax kind of got over on my brow, and wham-o!</li>
            <li> Success!!!!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hurt at all when I waxed my legs, a combo of good wax and my legs being used to it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m good now.</li>
            <li> Good size for home use.</li>
            <li> Get some baby powder for prepping the area and baby oil for residue removal, and you are good to go.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a good price</li>
            <li> /&gt;Aside from the wax container issues, I liked this wax warmer and felt like it was a great value.</li>
            <li> Good product for the size and price.</li>
            <li> the warmer is good</li>
            <li> I recieved everything for a great price and is very easy to use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the warmer and the wax.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> ONCE AGAIN, I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE PRODUCT AS WELL AS THE SPEEDINESS OF SHIPPING OF PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I got this kit to wax my eyebrows and armpits and it does a great job, much better results than going to salon</li>
            <li> Transaction went very smooth!</li>
            <li> But for everyone that does the right steps this wax is awesome...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the warmer itself if very nice</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS!</li>
            <li> I had items on-hand that made this process more salon-esque and efficient, and I would like to share them with you all!  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re going to love this product!</li>
            <li> I love my Gigi Wax warmer!</li>
            <li> This shipped to me very quickly and It is just great...</li>
            <li> On the bright side if I ever tour Europe I have a wax warmer that will work :)</li>
            <li> She was thrilled after she found what the kit included.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using pre-waxed strips that you warm in your hand before applying.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nice and spreadable.</li>
            <li> I had to go buy and cut my own fabric to use.</li>
            <li> Takes about 30 mins for the wax to be completely warm</li>
            <li> I will be saving hundreds of dollars by having my own.</li>
            <li> TAKES ABOUT 1/2 HOUR TO WARM UP THE WAX</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how effective this will be.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice.  </li>
            <li> It warms up quickly and does a really great job</li>
            <li> This is the best product so far that has worked for me!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good at getting all of the hairs off, but if it&#x27;s cooled too much, it won&#x27;t come off.</li>
            <li> The warmer keeps wax warm throughout the process, and the muslin strips are much better than the paper ones.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best to apply directly to your body AFTER all waxing is done and rub off with a washcloth that you can throw away  5.</li>
            <li> Overall I am happy with the product and happy</li>
            <li> Loved it , sticky but just use mineral or baby oil to clean up</li>
            <li> The warmer is great, didn&#x27;t take much time at all to warm the wax, and it seems to be well made.</li>
            <li> But it did arrive very fast which was great</li>
            <li> ;) happy waxing</li>
            <li> This is a great product for home use with a temp control so it won&#x27;t get too hot.</li>
            <li> Got the package quickly,  I did have to buy thicker applicators and strips separately.. but def a good buy..</li>
            <li> when I tried the &#x27;melt in the microwave&#x27; wax and he was happy doing it until he had to use the large muslin strips</li>
            <li> I started with drugstore brands (Sally Hansen) which were alright, but this kit is MUCH better.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great kit at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Just set it at &#x27;medium&#x27; and wait an hour and wax away :).</li>
            <li> I think you&#x27;ll enjoy it also!</li>
            <li> Wax heated up nicely and evenly smooth.</li>
            <li> love it love it</li>
            <li> : I LOVE the warmer.</li>
            <li> Much better then paying someone else to do it.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> This wax is WAY better than any of the sugar based wax products that I have used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> And honestly, you&#x27;re going to have to fiddle around with it to find what you&#x27;re comfortable with.</li>
            <li> i really love doing waxing.</li>
            <li> i wish it came with more muslins.</li>
            <li> but I love not having to go to a salon to get my eyebrows waxed.</li>
            <li> We just get it out every two weeks or so and about 5 minutes later he has perfect eyebrows.     </li>
            <li> Besides that, though, I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this item and so does my family.</li>
            <li> THIS REALLY WORKS GREAT.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you take all precautions to prep the area correctly.  </li>
            <li> I cannot count how many times I have used it instead of go to the salon.</li>
            <li> OK.</li>
            <li> This is OK.</li>
            <li> just make sure that your pot is NEVER tipped during non-use.  </li>
            <li> This product is ok, for the money.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to sell a product here, make sure your customers don&#x27;t have to be bilingual!&lt;br /&gt;Part</li>
            <li> Recommend to find better wax to use.</li>
            <li> I saw this at a salon and am glad I got a quality one.</li>
            <li> works great was easy to use even for me a first time user.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t right much good about the actually product except it looks very good.</li>
            <li> The first one lasted many, many years and saved me tons of money!  </li>
            <li> Great product easy to use no mess.</li>
            <li> heats up very nicely and delivers a wax that looks professionally done</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s convenient, easy to set up and use.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use.</li>
            <li> The wax warmer is compact and I can easily hid it when I&#x27;m done with it.</li>
            <li> This makes for easy cleanup and a disposal site for your used applicators (you want to change the applicators out every so often to prevent germs from getting into your wax)  4.</li>
            <li> Easy to prepare.  </li>
            <li> The wax is fine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with the temp of the wax (not too hot) and the low cost.</li>
            <li> First of all, let me say that I have only once waxed my legs  before with my best friend</li>
            <li> The wax provided lasts years and the strips are cheap and easy to find at beauty stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the cheap wax kits from the grocery store, with iffy results.</li>
            <li> I love it worth the money, I  haven&#x27;t paid in over year for my brows</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it is pain free</li>
            <li> The wax machine is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Very sticky, but quite effective.  </li>
            <li> This is a great wax system, especially for beginner self-waxers like myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great when you forget and need a wax last minute.</li>
            <li> Does a fantastic job on my mustache.  </li>
            <li> the machine and honey wax are good as any professional will use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than this, I found it effective and it is so nice to be able to do it whenever I want.</li>
            <li> this was exactly what I was looking for!!</li>
            <li> overall very very nice product.</li>
            <li> Not so great on the beard type hairs on my chin but will take out the long fine ones that grow there.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It was easy to use and set up and took about 20-30 minutes for the wax to warm completely.</li>
            <li> I am pretty pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I am really excited about this wax.</li>
            <li> Upon opening the box, I&#x27;m excited to see that all the supplies are for your FACE.</li>
            <li> The small strips and applicators are perfect for the eyebrow and lip area.</li>
            <li> wax worked well and grabbed most of the hairs the first time around, some of the missed hairs could have just been from my inexperience versus the wax.</li>
            <li> More detailed information about the items being sold would have saved everyone much time, effort and money.  </li>
            <li> I love having my own personal waxing machine to use it wherever I want.</li>
            <li> Always clean eyebrows.</li>
            <li> It has the third prong on the plug, so it&#x27;s \\&quot;grounded\\&quot;, which I wasn&#x27;t expecting, but that&#x27;s a pleasant surprise</li>
            <li> Never use without the special powder that you apply under wax.  </li>
            <li> My fault entirely, but its a good tip for newbies.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s been there much longer than that too.</li>
            <li> I shopped around and this looked good enough to get the job done.</li>
            <li> I got 2 full leg waxes out of 1 tub of wax.</li>
            <li> and it takes 20 strips for a full leg wax.</li>
            <li> I love it and it is so much quicker and safer than warming wax up in the microwave.</li>
            <li> wax warms up quickly and maintains even heat</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for the girl who&#x27;s not afraid to put hot wax on her own face and doesn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money going to the salon to have someone else do it for her everytime.</li>
            <li> It does get very hot</li>
            <li> Great investment if your brow game is strong!</li>
            <li> I find this amazing because after three days I always see hair coming back - even if I waited a month to let my eyebrows grow out and wax them.</li>
            <li> You can get the same results in the comfort of your own home.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice because it has different temperature settings.</li>
            <li> Its definitely worth the money and pays itself off.</li>
            <li> The sleeve provided is REALLY USEFUL.</li>
            <li> did purchase the dusting powder, pre and post lotion, which I would recommend - definately worth the money.</li>
            <li> and it was worth every penny.    </li>
            <li> After decades of going to a salon to get a lip wax, I can finally do it myself in the comfort of my own home.</li>
            <li> Wax works just as good as when i spent 10 dollars a week getting my eyebrows waxed!</li>
            <li> The sticks and strips, however, are ONLY suitable for eyebrow waxing.</li>
            <li> The warmer and wax are great but the wood applicators and muslin strips are the small size for bikini zone (and assuming since the kit came with all purpose wax you&#x27;re using for all leg as I was)  </li>
            <li> You can heat the wax to slightly running consistency and it will still do a good job.</li>
            <li> The wax is pretty good - takes about half hour to heat up.</li>
            <li> Package arrived prior to &amp;#34;deliver date&amp;#34; and it is just as described - the wax is very sticky, be sure and let the entire container warm up and not just the edges (</li>
            <li> If you are using this wax kit for facial waxing then that would be fine, but I do full leg waxes.</li>
            <li> I tried it first to see how if it worked.  </li>
            <li> Microwaving wax means that it doesn&#x27;t stay warm long, so I really wanted to get a warmer.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also ok for underarm waxing, but I would recommend having someone help you - you literally need a third hand to wax your armpits!</li>
            <li> The first time someone knocked this over at my house and it was all sticky.</li>
            <li> I just used this for the first time today so to test</li>
            <li> Used my wax warmer for the first time tonight and wish I&#x27;d purchased one years ago.      </li>
            <li> This is not a joke I have talked to several people that love this wax but the first couple times they didn&#x27;t dust themselves well enough and the wax took the top layer of skin as well as the hair...</li>
            <li> THANKS!</li>
            <li> works great and will def last for a long time.</li>
            <li> So i used this product for the first time in about 2 years and it didnt do no wonders.</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The strips were the perfect size for the face area (brows, lip, etc), but again they would be too small for larger areas of application.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Wax heats up fast!</li>
            <li> This was my first time to try waxing.</li>
            <li> I toned first.</li>
            <li> Not so much!</li>
            <li> My hair grows in several directions, I have fine and course hair and in between all in one spot plus sensitive skin (read:not easy to wax).</li>
            <li> but I prefer different wax because it is very runny and hard to use but warmer works at perfect temperatures.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d seen a few reviews mention that, so I was prepared and had larger strips at home - old torn-up bedsheets work great!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really just warm to the touch if heated correctly not hot.</li>
            <li> This kit has pretty much all you need.</li>
            <li> this purchase will certainly make it less of a chore - glad I went for it!</li>
            <li> Am looking to get the large muslin roll</li>
            <li> Takes forever to warm up and it was a sticky mess</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have suggested I lightly dusted my skin with baby powder rather than buying the special powder.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair above my lip</li>
            <li> Many of these items are already around your house (I only purchased GENERIC baby oil for $1 at the local Fred Meyer) and make the process SO EASY!  </li>
            <li> I used a large blush brush, worked really well.</li>
            <li> We have the whole line of products there too, but none of them ever really get used except the wax off, but that&#x27;s easily replaced at home, so you don&#x27;t really neeeeed all the lotions and stuff, unless you&#x27;re going to actually use this for a salon and want to look fancy.</li>
            <li> If you turn the temp to High, the wax gets too hot and will not come off of the face like it should.</li>
            <li> I was really nervous about this purchase.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really afford to go out and get waxed</li>
            <li> As the wax gets lower you don&#x27;t need as much heat.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like the wax.</li>
            <li> it is VERY sticky.</li>
            <li> And if you dont get yourself ready with the pre waxing and the dusting then when u rip off the wax you will be ripping off skin too...</li>
            <li> IT prevents the wax from spilling around and making the whole place messy&lt;br</li>
            <li> My eyebrows hurt so much from trying to do this twice</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really like the honee wax</li>
            <li> the was goes on much smoother.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the muslin strips that come included because the wax seeps through and makes your hands or gloves all sticky.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t heat the wax very well.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> At home waxing is so easy with this product that contained all the products needed, wax strips only lasted me a few weeks easy enough to order more</li>
            <li> Great product, will last a long time, and definitely will save tons of money at the salon.</li>
            <li> You will definitely get your moneys worth out of it!</li>
            <li> The down side is you really have to use all your Gigi lotion packs on your face when waxing with this wax and make sure u dust yourself very well before you put this wax on ANYWHERE...</li>
            <li> Baby Oil - Use to clean up spills on the floor, or unwanted wax left on your face, legs, or chacha.</li>
            <li> and I have to turn it off once I get started and then back on again if it gets too cool.</li>
            <li> but there are too many choices in this country to settle for less than what I thought I was buying.  </li>
            <li> Also, I didnt let the wax get hot enough the first time I used it</li>
            <li> Just make sure you buy extra tape if you&#x27;re doing a man&#x27;s back.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the honey wax, it&#x27;s too sticky and messy, however it all came just as expected and the rest of the materials are great.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Point being, maybe getting your eyebrows done by a profesional is worth it, especially if you don&#x27;t have a steady hand.  </li>
            <li> THIS WILL PAY FOR ITSELF IN JUST A FEW MORE USES.  </li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;ve missed a spot and can&#x27;t get the wax off an area with a larger strip, these little ones make for great clean up and grab all the small bits of wax.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to waxing, and figured I would do it at home.  </li>
            <li> so I just ordered a new one</li>
            <li> we had to just purchase a new pot.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase, except that the strips are too small to do my legs and wish they had included some of the bigger strips.</li>
            <li> Small strips are great - I think the applicators are a little too long and thin, I prefer short and stubby popsicle sticks for the best amount of control.   </li>
            <li> I picked up some disposable table cloths to lay underneath me next time because I still have wax stuck to my tile floor from the first time</li>
            <li> I feel the low setting is still a bit too hot</li>
            <li> The cord is 6 feet long, which is pretty decent.</li>
            <li> , that was gone easily, I have a few course hairs on my chin.</li>
            <li> This is the same exact product that the professional salons use.</li>
            <li> B000WFEH02 GIGI Large Wooden Spatulas -</li>
            <li> husband was amazing and helped with the back of my legs, I had to ask for help while in a comprimising position after I realized it would be impossible to get it on my own as I do not have bionic powers and am not double jointed (to his dismay)</li>
            <li> First of all, I am not a professional, I use this for home use.</li>
            <li> Took about an hour for the wax to liquefy completely; then turned it to medium.  </li>
            <li> &amp; [[ASIN:B0002YH3PY GIGI Natural Muslin Roll]]).</li>
            <li> I just wish I could find a natural wax with sugar instead of this \\&quot;honee\\&quot; wax that does not wash off your skin</li>
            <li> Soothing Lotion - For use after waxing is complete and any residue is removed by baby oil  </li>
            <li> so I order the chocolate wax instead because I have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I really wish the canister was designed differently so that my issue doesn&#x27;t happen again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use old towels or rags you don&#x27;t care about.</li>
            <li> which was what I kept reminding myself when I would get a little too excited and drip wax.   </li>
            <li> The ONLY thing is that the lid does not exactly stay on securely</li>
            <li> If you are clumsy and drop wax around, it is a real pain to clean it.</li>
            <li> do recommended turning it on high for the first 20-30min then turning it down to M  and stirring it frequently, it takes a while to melt the wax evenly</li>
            <li> But next time, I&#x27;m letting a pro do my brows, that is, if it grows back! ;-)</li>
            <li> I think this wax is a good quality and does well on my thick dark hair.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a high quality heater and it comes with everything you need to get started waxing.</li>
            <li> I wish there was a temperature setting here and not just high - low.</li>
            <li> I was extremely nervous to us a hot wax</li>
            <li> No regrets!</li>
            <li> Always keep it up right and don&#x27;t get any wax on the sides of it or you will have a heck of a mess</li>
            <li> , it wasn&#x27;t I can not never expected.</li>
            <li> The honee wax is really sticky so be careful not to get it on anything, and if you do, use baby oil to remove it.</li>
            <li> Had this waxier for years and it finally died on me so bought a new one differently recommend for those who want to wax at home!</li>
            <li> She thought at first that she&#x27;d have to buy the actual wax and some other stuff.</li>
            <li> I cleaned up the small areas of wax residue by pressing the muslin quickly against them and pulling.  </li>
            <li> I was very worried that it is not as professional or heavy duty as it looks.</li>
            <li> biggest complaint is there are two pamphlets of detailed instructions..and neither are in ENGLISH!</li>
            <li> When I first tried opening it, the wax was firmly stuck to the lid.</li>
            <li> course it can be messy, it&#x27;s hot wax.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I would suggest is making sure you put paper or something down where you are working as the wax is hard to remove from surfaces.</li>
            <li> They are thin and they break easily and they don&#x27;t hold enough amount of wax on it</li>
            <li> Very unhappy as it came with plug not for U.S&lt;br /&gt;Adjusting up one star as I was taken care of my customer service who helped me locate an adapter for a great price.</li>
            <li> None of the stinging I got with the cold strips and hair removal is way more complete!  </li>
            <li> Due to other reviews of the wax being messy I laid out old newspaper everywhere for clean up</li>
            <li> Although other reviewers complained about the stickiness (and they are correct), its easy to remove with any kitchen oil product (olive oil, sunflower oil).</li>
            <li> I have realized that trying to clean it with water only makes it worse.</li>
            <li> I usually take some oil and rub it on the fallen wax with a paper towel to clean up the mess</li>
            <li> Moreover, the sticks are barely larger than toothpicks -- they are useless for applying wax except perhaps on brows or fine detail work.</li>
            <li> I have some experience waxing with cold, sugar wax, this is my first time using a hot wax.</li>
            <li> Baby Powder - Put a tiny dab on a cotton swab and brush over where you \\&quot;toned\\&quot; to dry out the area  3.</li>
            <li> I just searched for a hot wax kit that I could have at home, and this was the first one that popped up, and it&#x27;s a lot less expensive than I thought.</li>
            <li> but I was in extreme pain and two days later am dealing with extremely red eyebrows, loss of skin, puffiness, swelling, oozing.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if you are waxing small areas of the face (lip, brow, chin).</li>
            <li> These small ones could be used for sensitive areas or facial waxing.</li>
            <li> It left minimal redness.</li>
            <li> I cut the strips between 8-10\\&quot; long</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a long time and still have supplies.</li>
            <li> For larger areas such as underarm, bikini, or leg, they would definitely be too small.</li>
            <li> I put an old towel under the warmer and used the Gigi muslin strips - small and medium.      </li>
            <li> I agree that the applicator sticks were pretty thin, but I had no issues using them to apply wax to my eyebrows or lip area.</li>
            <li> The muslin strips sometimes have loose threads that stick to the skin</li>
            <li> The only slight glitch is the products that come with it.  </li>
            <li> The wooden applicators are too small, I would have preferred them slightly bigger in size</li>
            <li> the key seems to be \\&quot;less is more\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It takes a little bit of rubbing if there&#x27;s a lot of wax left in an area, but nothing unbearable.  </li>
            <li> and i don&#x27;t get those little red spots after either.</li>
            <li> That may be why I find the temperature setting to be too high, but I like the way the hard wax doesn&#x27;t leave you sticky and takes less time to use.</li>
            <li> I had a few of the satin strips left from years ago</li>
            <li> I use it with a harder wax.</li>
            <li> I spent $44 dollars or so on this</li>
            <li> We found that acetone helps to remove it from counter tops but be careful.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not possible to give a 5 star review when I have half an eyebrow gone, but that&#x27;s not the warmer kit&#x27;s fault!</li>
            <li> But the only issue is that the wax takes too long to heat up and the wooden spatula is too thin to apply on hands and legs.</li>
            <li> so I know it lasts at least that long, being on 8 hours a day and being used constantly.</li>
            <li> the the strip is not really good as professional can use the honey never comes out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> Other than that no issue with quality of the product and the cotton wax strips.</li>
            <li> I studied all of the reviews for this and other waxes both on Amazon and other websites.</li>
            <li> I spilled my wife&#x27;s other wax kit while moving</li>
            <li> I would recommend buying bigger wax strips and wax applicators - the ones that come with the kit are small.</li>
            <li> The machine works as expected, but if you get it do not forget the wax remover as it is sticky and does not like to come off!</li>
            <li> It pays for it itself with only a few uses!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not interested in buying an adapter to make it work.  </li>
            <li> Did the other side, and then used the wax remover.</li>
            <li> of the instruction, in the small booklet are in English..</li>
            <li> Please be very careful or you will end up hurting yourself...</li>
            <li> Definitely need the collars or it could be a real mess.</li>
            <li> So you end up using less wax, you can reuse a strip multiple times while waxing before you need to switch to another one (since you apply only a thin layer of wax)&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> only complaint is with the wax tub itself.</li>
            <li> Wax Paper - Put this down on the floor, counter, or wherever you are choosing to wax.</li>
            <li> I recommend he lay down.  </li>
            <li> The wax is extremely sticky!  </li>
            <li> I ordered this kit after losing half of an eyebrow from a waxing at a salon.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the muslin strips and wood sticks are too small.</li>
            <li> Please try this if you want to save money in the long run but to save you a ton of time and serious mess</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it on my bikini area just yet, but will probably be using the little strips.</li>
            <li> Baby powder helps a little (in regards to lessening the pain).</li>
            <li> Its a little messy if you don&#x27;t have a lot of practice.  </li>
            <li> I messed up few times</li>
            <li> It arrived on time, was packaged well, and nothing was missing.</li>
            <li> Takes a few uses to get a feel for it</li>
            <li> I was spending a lot of time plucking every few weeks</li>
            <li> Not too messy.</li>
            <li> I powdered the areas to be waxed (lip &amp; brows), I applied a thin layer of wax to one side of my upper lip, then pressed the strip, then held the skin, released my breath, and yanked.</li>
            <li> The only reason i gave it 4 star is i did not like the wood applicators they are so thin that often the wax is dripping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but thats not a huge deal.</li>
            <li> Half the brow gone!</li>
            <li> Extremely sticky and hard to get off wax.</li>
            <li> WAY small.</li>
            <li> I have tried sugaring wax products in the past before I decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li> Plenty of strips for small jobs like the mustache area and eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> and it was very messy</li>
            <li> the wax does NOT harden all the way when its not heated and its a terrible mess to clean up.  </li>
            <li> but it was not that painful (take into account that I am used to waxing and I am only comparing it to other waxes).</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve cleaned it at least 7 times).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small Strips &amp; Wood Applicators: when these arrived I realized how small they were.</li>
            <li> slow, you&#x27;re not a Pro\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I have thick hairs on my eyebrows (which i used the product for) and it didnt take anything off.</li>
            <li> The application sticks are cheesy, as other reviews have stated.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> The strips that came with it are very small.</li>
            <li> I will have to seriously consider whether or not I will use Amazon again.</li>
            <li> The strips are maybe dollar size-ish and the sticks are thin and brittle.&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> The wax strips are so damn thin</li>
            <li> The wax smells a little bad, but it&#x27;s not intolerable.</li>
            <li> and I have difficult hair to wax.</li>
            <li> However; I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Or else you will end up with a very irritating sticky body.  </li>
            <li> Very sloppy to apply.  </li>
            <li> The sticks that came with it though are very useless.</li>
            <li> It is so painful</li>
            <li> but I was just so frustrated.</li>
            <li> I hate worrying about UFH -</li>
            <li> and I am very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> What a horrible product.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed!!</li>
            <li> Not too bad!!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Its a little messy if you don&#x27;t have a lot of practice.  Also, I didnt let the wax get hot enough the first time I used it and it damaged my skin a bit.  My fault entirely, but its a good tip for newbies.  Overall I am happy with the product and happy I can stop paying $10 every time I go to the salon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the warmer and the wax. Both very effective. The sticks and strips, however, are ONLY suitable for eyebrow waxing. They are unusable for leg waxing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to waxing, and figured I would do it at home.  I started with drugstore brands (Sally Hansen) which were alright, but this kit is MUCH better.  The warmer keeps wax warm throughout the process, and the muslin strips are much better than the paper ones.  It&#x27;s a great kit at a reasonable price.  I&#x27;m really happy i bought it.</li>
            <li> I have never used a waxing product before but purchased one for my daughter for her eyebrow.  I tried it first to see how if it worked.  There were no instructions at all but I did my best.  I warmed the wax and tried it on the back of my hand.  I proceeded to use the wax and apply the strips.  It successfully removed some hair but I was in extreme pain and two days later am dealing with extremely red eyebrows, loss of skin, puffiness, swelling, oozing.  It is so painful I can&#x27;t touch the area and I can&#x27;t sleep.  What a horrible product.  That goodness I didn&#x27;t use it on my daughter.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I am pretty pleased with it. I highly recommend this product to everyone. Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the cheap wax kits from the grocery store, with iffy results. Microwaving wax means that it doesn&#x27;t stay warm long, so I really wanted to get a warmer. It takes a while to heat the wax up, but is very good at keeping it warm once it&#x27;s melted. The cord is 6 feet long, which is pretty decent. If you need it longer, an extension cord should suffice. It has the third prong on the plug, so it&#x27;s \\&quot;grounded\\&quot;, which I wasn&#x27;t expecting, but that&#x27;s a pleasant surprise and I was impressed by that detail.  The wax smells a little bad, but it&#x27;s not intolerable. It&#x27;s very good at getting all of the hairs off, but if it&#x27;s cooled too much, it won&#x27;t come off. It didn&#x27;t hurt at all when I waxed my legs, a combo of good wax and my legs being used to it. You do need baby oil to get any residual wax off of your skin. It takes a little bit of rubbing if there&#x27;s a lot of wax left in an area, but nothing unbearable.  The sticks and strips provided with the kit are tiny, as a warning. I&#x27;d seen a few reviews mention that, so I was prepared and had larger strips at home - old torn-up bedsheets work great! The strips provided are for eyebrow waxing - very tiny. However, if you&#x27;ve missed a spot and can&#x27;t get the wax off an area with a larger strip, these little ones make for great clean up and grab all the small bits of wax. They&#x27;re also ok for underarm waxing, but I would recommend having someone help you - you literally need a third hand to wax your armpits! I haven&#x27;t tried it on my bikini area just yet, but will probably be using the little strips. I will update when I do.</li>
            <li> Great product easy to use no mess. I don&#x27;t wait for the wax to heat all the way and it still works great. Am looking to get the large muslin roll so I can wax my legs too. What a buy!</li>
            <li> I love it worth the money, I  haven&#x27;t paid in over year for my brows I messed up few times but I&#x27;m good now.</li>
            <li> Works just like the one in the nail saloon! Loved it , sticky but just use mineral or baby oil to clean up</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading the reviews. Its definitely value for money. But the only issue is that the wax takes too long to heat up and the wooden spatula is too thin to apply on hands and legs. Other than that no issue with quality of the product and the cotton wax strips. They are quite handy!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my younger sister. It arrived on time, was packaged well, and nothing was missing. She was thrilled after she found what the kit included. It had everything she needed. She thought at first that she&#x27;d have to buy the actual wax and some other stuff. Anyway, she was very happy.</li>
            <li> This is a great, money-saving set.  I use it all the time.  This is my 2nd Gigi waxing kit actually.  The first one lasted many, many years and saved me tons of money!  The only slight glitch is the products that come with it.  The wax is fine but I am already set in my preferences for strips and applicators so I prefer wider versions, on both counts.  Still.. for the price, this is an awesome buy!</li>
            <li> The warmer and wax are great but the wood applicators and muslin strips are the small size for bikini zone (and assuming since the kit came with all purpose wax you&#x27;re using for all leg as I was)  Also I do not recommend using this type of muslin strips regardless of the size as they leave A LOT of wax and string bits will be stuck to you and on whom ever might be assisting you in your waxing needs.  This is still a great deal for just the wax and warmer alone.  Please try this if you want to save money in the long run but to save you a ton of time and serious mess you will need some larger wood applicators and satin non-woven cloth strips... (they are white - do not have any strings and take the wax off beautifully)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband was amazing and helped with the back of my legs, I had to ask for help while in a comprimising position after I realized it would be impossible to get it on my own as I do not have bionic powers and am not double jointed (to his dismay) I had a few of the satin strips left from years ago when I tried the &#x27;melt in the microwave&#x27; wax and he was happy doing it until he had to use the large muslin strips and it was very messy that is how I know they work and are what you&#x27;ll want/need.  ;) happy waxing</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS! I bought this twice. The first time someone knocked this over at my house and it was all sticky. I didn&#x27;t want to put up with cleaning it so I just ordered a new one</li>
            <li> I go to Toni &amp; Guy Academy and this is what we use there. I just searched for a hot wax kit that I could have at home, and this was the first one that popped up, and it&#x27;s a lot less expensive than I thought. We have the whole line of products there too, but none of them ever really get used except the wax off, but that&#x27;s easily replaced at home, so you don&#x27;t really neeeeed all the lotions and stuff, unless you&#x27;re going to actually use this for a salon and want to look fancy. But it&#x27;s really simple to use. Just set it at &#x27;medium&#x27; and wait an hour and wax away :). I&#x27;ve been at school for a year, so I know it lasts at least that long, being on 8 hours a day and being used constantly. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s been there much longer than that too.</li>
            <li> In just using this product once, it has paid for itself. I&#x27;m very impressed with the temp of the wax (not too hot) and the low cost. Although other reviewers complained about the stickiness (and they are correct), its easy to remove with any kitchen oil product (olive oil, sunflower oil). I highly recommend this product if you are waxing small areas of the face (lip, brow, chin). This is not the ideal product for bikini. Great product, will last a long time, and definitely will save tons of money at the salon. You can get the same results in the comfort of your own home.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product.  Everything that you need is included.  The price is a lot lower compared to the same product in the stores.</li>
            <li> First of all, I am not a professional, I use this for home use. I have some experience waxing with cold, sugar wax, this is my first time using a hot wax. I studied all of the reviews for this and other waxes both on Amazon and other websites. I was really nervous about this purchase. I can&#x27;t really afford to go out and get waxed and I have difficult hair to wax. My hair grows in several directions, I have fine and course hair and in between all in one spot plus sensitive skin (read:not easy to wax). I used it on my face, chin, upper lip. I have fine hair above my lip, that was gone easily, I have a few course hairs on my chin. Some of this did not go with the strip but I am assuming, because others did, this is will be on a learning curve for me. Sugar wax never got any of those hairs. I just used this for the first time today so to test it&#x27;s ability to do course hair I checked on spot on my leg and it got 99&amp; of the hairs, with out prepping the area. I am really excited about this wax. I was extremely nervous to us a hot wax but it&#x27;s really just warm to the touch if heated correctly not hot. It left minimal redness. I wouldn&#x27;t say it is pain free but it was not that painful (take into account that I am used to waxing and I am only comparing it to other waxes). Due to other reviews of the wax being messy I laid out old newspaper everywhere for clean up but it really wasn&#x27;t messy. As other reviewers have suggested I lightly dusted my skin with baby powder rather than buying the special powder. I used a large blush brush, worked really well. I also used baby oil as the remover which also worked well.</li>
            <li> I got this kit with a gift card - always wanted to try a wax warmer, never wanted to spend the money...I&#x27;ve been using pre-waxed strips that you warm in your hand before applying.  Used my wax warmer for the first time tonight and wish I&#x27;d purchased one years ago.      Took about an hour for the wax to liquefy completely; then turned it to medium.  I pre-cleansed and used a dusting of baby powder as recommended by another review - what a difference!  None of the stinging I got with the cold strips and hair removal is way more complete!  Definitely need the collars or it could be a real mess. I put an old towel under the warmer and used the Gigi muslin strips - small and medium.      I cleaned up the small areas of wax residue by pressing the muslin quickly against them and pulling.  Used some leftover wax-off oil from one of my Sally Hansen kits, but will get baby oil when that runs out.  I hate worrying about UFH - this purchase will certainly make it less of a chore - glad I went for it!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase, except that the strips are too small to do my legs and wish they had included some of the bigger strips. The wax machine is fantastic. No regrets!</li>
            <li> I spilled my wife&#x27;s other wax kit while moving so I owed it to her to get something else. I shopped around and this looked good enough to get the job done. Overall this is a high quality heater and it comes with everything you need to get started waxing. She loves it so I&#x27;ve given it 5 starts. I think you&#x27;ll enjoy it also!</li>
            <li> I used this the day that it arrived. It&#x27;s convenient, easy to set up and use. It has everything you need, all in one. It does get very hot so anyone buying should pay close attention to those instructions.</li>
            <li> Good size for home use.</li>
            <li> So I bought the waxing kit so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to spend $10 every time I wanted to get my eyebrows waxed.  Unfortunately, I ended up with waxing too much of my left brow at one point, but it still looked okay. Point being, maybe getting your eyebrows done by a profesional is worth it, especially if you don&#x27;t have a steady hand.  In my case, I&#x27;d rather take the risk and save some money..at least I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> This product is great! I have not had any problems. I will never pay a salon for an eyebrow wax again!</li>
            <li> Wax heated up nicely and evenly smooth. My only complaint is that the muslin strips and wood sticks are too small.</li>
            <li> girl friend loves it. best gift shes ever got. perfect transaction and company to deal with. love it love it</li>
            <li> This kit has pretty much all you need. Get some baby powder for prepping the area and baby oil for residue removal, and you are good to go. I will never pay for salon waxing again. Yay!</li>
            <li> Warmer: I LOVE the warmer. I let the wax heat up for 30-45 mins and it&#x27;s nice and spreadable. It&#x27;s nice because it has different temperature settings. As the wax gets lower you don&#x27;t need as much heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All Purpose Honee Wax: I really like the wax. It grabs every hair. I got 2 full leg waxes out of 1 tub of wax. BEWARE: it is VERY sticky. If you&#x27;re used to creme waxes, this is way stickier. I picked up some disposable table cloths to lay underneath me next time because I still have wax stuck to my tile floor from the first time (I&#x27;ve cleaned it at least 7 times).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small Strips &amp; Wood Applicators: when these arrived I realized how small they were. WAY small. The strips are about 2x10 cm and the sticks are about 1x10 cm. If you are using this wax kit for facial waxing then that would be fine, but I do full leg waxes. I had to run to the beauty supply store and buy larger wooden applicator and muslin strips ([[ASIN:B000WFEH02 GIGI Large Wooden Spatulas - 100 ct.]] &amp; [[ASIN:B0002YH3PY GIGI Natural Muslin Roll]]). I cut the strips between 8-10\\&quot; long and it takes 20 strips for a full leg wax.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for home use with a temp control so it won&#x27;t get too hot.Same as a lot of pros use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve met people who say they can wax once every two weeks. I find this amazing because after three days I always see hair coming back - even if I waited a month to let my eyebrows grow out and wax them. This product is easy to use. The wax warmer is compact and I can easily hid it when I&#x27;m done with it. The wax is pretty good - takes about half hour to heat up. I only use this product on my face and underarms and does what I need it to do. Much better then paying someone else to do it.&lt;br /&gt;If you want to wax larger areas (i.e. your legs) I would recommend buying bigger wax strips and wax applicators - the ones that come with the kit are small. The strips are maybe dollar size-ish and the sticks are thin and brittle.&lt;br /&gt;Over all - 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Wax works just as good as when i spent 10 dollars a week getting my eyebrows waxed! Its definitely worth the money and pays itself off. This has to be one of my greatest purchases and would recommend it to anybody!</li>
            <li> This shipped to me very quickly and It is just great... The pot heats up excellent and the wax is very good quality wax... The down side is you really have to use all your Gigi lotion packs on your face when waxing with this wax and make sure u dust yourself very well before you put this wax on ANYWHERE... This wax is extremly sticky.. And if you dont get yourself ready with the pre waxing and the dusting then when u rip off the wax you will be ripping off skin too... This is not a joke I have talked to several people that love this wax but the first couple times they didn&#x27;t dust themselves well enough and the wax took the top layer of skin as well as the hair... Please be very careful or you will end up hurting yourself... But for everyone that does the right steps this wax is awesome... I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Had this waxier for years and it finally died on me so bought a new one differently recommend for those who want to wax at home! This is my 3 one</li>
            <li> I have tried sugaring wax products in the past before I decided to give this a try. This wax is WAY better than any of the sugar based wax products that I have used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;1) You can heat the wax to slightly running consistency and it will still do a good job. So you end up using less wax, you can reuse a strip multiple times while waxing before you need to switch to another one (since you apply only a thin layer of wax)&lt;br /&gt;2) The warmer does its job- heats the wax and allows you to set it a different heat settings. Nothing fancy there-functional and just what&#x27;s needed&lt;br /&gt;3) The sleeve provided is REALLY USEFUL. IT prevents the wax from spilling around and making the whole place messy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;1) The wooden applicators are too small, I would have preferred them slightly bigger in size&lt;br /&gt;2) The muslin strips sometimes have loose threads that stick to the skin&lt;br /&gt;3) If you are clumsy and drop wax around, it is a real pain to clean it. I have realized that trying to clean it with water only makes it worse. I usually take some oil and rub it on the fallen wax with a paper towel to clean up the mess&lt;br /&gt;4) Warming the wax takes 25 mins or so. You have to therefore plan this activity accordingly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all- I am really happy with this product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it is very similar to what I have seen in the saloon I go to back home. I was very worried that it is not as professional or heavy duty as it looks. However; I was wrong. It was very good and does its job. It takes time to heat up to melt the wax but it does it anyway. It takes about 15-25 mins to melt all the wax. I just wish I could find a natural wax with sugar instead of this \\&quot;honee\\&quot; wax that does not wash off your skin but instead you must use baby oil or get the \\&quot;wax off\\&quot; to remove the extra wax. Or else you will end up with a very irritating sticky body.  The sticks that came with it though are very useless. They are thin and they break easily and they don&#x27;t hold enough amount of wax on it so you can apply. The strips that came with it are very small. I had to go buy and cut my own fabric to use. These small ones could be used for sensitive areas or facial waxing.</li>
            <li> ONCE AGAIN, I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE PRODUCT AS WELL AS THE SPEEDINESS OF SHIPPING OF PRODUCT. THANKS!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for another person, hopefully they like it, as they wanted to try this product.</li>
            <li> I JUST received my Gigi Waxing Kit and had to spend some time \\&quot;getting acquainted!\\&quot;  First of all, let me say that I have only once waxed my legs  before with my best friend, I didn&#x27;t know what I was doing, but I got the hang of it (and shouted a lot of profanities + Harry Potter references). SO I consider myself to be a \\&quot;waxing virgin\\&quot; because I&#x27;ve only had my eyebrows and upper lip done a handful of times in a salon (for $25 a pop).  Upon opening the box, I&#x27;m excited to see that all the supplies are for your FACE. Small strips are great - I think the applicators are a little too long and thin, I prefer short and stubby popsicle sticks for the best amount of control.   I had items on-hand that made this process more salon-esque and efficient, and I would like to share them with you all!  1. Toner - This cleans the desired waxing area of any makeup (eyebrows, chin, upper lip, etc.) and dirt, which my esthetician does before waxing  2. Baby Powder - Put a tiny dab on a cotton swab and brush over where you \\&quot;toned\\&quot; to dry out the area  3. Wax Paper - Put this down on the floor, counter, or wherever you are choosing to wax. This makes for easy cleanup and a disposal site for your used applicators (you want to change the applicators out every so often to prevent germs from getting into your wax)  4. Baby Oil - Use to clean up spills on the floor, or unwanted wax left on your face, legs, or chacha. It&#x27;s best to apply directly to your body AFTER all waxing is done and rub off with a washcloth that you can throw away  5. Soothing Lotion - For use after waxing is complete and any residue is removed by baby oil  *Many of these items are already around your house (I only purchased GENERIC baby oil for $1 at the local Fred Meyer) and make the process SO EASY!  I had read reviews of what the wax consistency needed to be like for the best results. And honestly, you&#x27;re going to have to fiddle around with it to find what you&#x27;re comfortable with. Everyone has different preferences for heat, so just give yourself some time and you will get the hang of it! Just remember, \\&quot;Go slow, you&#x27;re not a Pro\\&quot; which was what I kept reminding myself when I would get a little too excited and drip wax.   Good luck, and happy waxing! You&#x27;re going to love this product!</li>
            <li> The machine works as expected, but if you get it do not forget the wax remover as it is sticky and does not like to come off!</li>
            <li> i really love doing waxing. it works perfectly. i wish it came with more muslins. i had to order muslin roll separetaly.</li>
            <li> this was exactly what I was looking for!! works great and will def last for a long time. Takes about 30 mins for the wax to be completely warm but I wont ever go to a salon again!</li>
            <li> So i used this product for the first time in about 2 years and it didnt do no wonders. The wax strips are so damn thin that when you put the wax on the area and then put the strip on its all over your damn hands. You would think they would supply all the stuff for it. I never had a problem with gigi waxer until today and I am very disappointed.  I have thick hairs on my eyebrows (which i used the product for) and it didnt take anything off. I used this also in cosemetology school and i never had a problem. !!!!!! My eyebrows hurt so much from trying to do this twice and im beyond pissed that I have to walk around with puffy eyebrows</li>
            <li> I got this kit to wax my eyebrows and armpits and it does a great job, much better results than going to salon and i don&#x27;t get those little red spots after either. I think this wax is a good quality and does well on my thick dark hair. I would definitely recommend this kit to anyone wanting to wax at home. The ONLY thing is that the lid does not exactly stay on securely but thats not a huge deal.</li>
            <li> Had to adjust to using a strip wax, but once I did.... I love it and it is so much quicker and safer than warming wax up in the microwave.</li>
            <li> Perfect compact size&lt;br /&gt;Easy for storage&lt;br /&gt;Easy usage&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really like the honee wax so I order the chocolate wax instead because I have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I do recommended turning it on high for the first 20-30min then turning it down to M  and stirring it frequently, it takes a while to melt the wax evenly</li>
            <li> At home waxing is so easy with this product that contained all the products needed, wax strips only lasted me a few weeks easy enough to order more</li>
            <li> I wish there was a temperature setting here and not just high - low. I feel the low setting is still a bit too hot and I have to turn it off once I get started and then back on again if it gets too cool. But it&#x27;s a good price and it gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, I should point out that I didn&#x27;t like the wax and strips. I use it with a harder wax. That may be why I find the temperature setting to be too high, but I like the way the hard wax doesn&#x27;t leave you sticky and takes less time to use.</li>
            <li> the machine and honey wax are good as any professional will use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but the the strip is not really good as professional can use the honey never comes out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it wasn&#x27;t I can not never expected.</li>
            <li> Except for having to go out and find an adapter for the plug, it&#x27;s all it says it is.</li>
            <li> Package arrived prior to &amp;#34;deliver date&amp;#34; and it is just as described - the wax is very sticky, be sure and let the entire container warm up and not just the edges (like I did 1st time) the was goes on much smoother.  Remember to take your time and where you put the wax, the hair will come off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did purchase the dusting powder, pre and post lotion, which I would recommend - definately worth the money.</li>
            <li> I think the kit is great. Takes a few uses to get a feel for it but I love not having to go to a salon to get my eyebrows waxed. It pays for it itself with only a few uses!</li>
            <li> I just cannot understand selling a product that requires 220v electricity in a country that operates on the 110v system!  I&#x27;m not interested in buying an adapter to make it work.  It should work...as is!!  If I had known, prior to purchase, that this required an additional adapter I would not have bought it.  I&#x27;m sure the warmer itself if very nice but there are too many choices in this country to settle for less than what I thought I was buying.  Very disappointed.  Very disappointed!! More detailed information about the items being sold would have saved everyone much time, effort and money.  I will have to seriously consider whether or not I will use Amazon again.</li>
            <li> Extremely sticky and hard to get off wax. Wish never got it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this kit after losing half of an eyebrow from a waxing at a salon. You will definitely get your moneys worth out of it! The small strips and applicators are perfect for the eyebrow and lip area. The honee wax is really sticky so be careful not to get it on anything, and if you do, use baby oil to remove it.</li>
            <li> I spent $44 dollars or so on this and it was worth every penny.    I actually got if for waxing my fiance&#x27;s eyebrows. I was spending a lot of time plucking every few weeks and so we decided to invest in this instead.    We just get it out every two weeks or so and about 5 minutes later he has perfect eyebrows.     If you turn the temp to High, the wax gets too hot and will not come off of the face like it should. It is best to turn the temp to Med-High and let it sit for about 20 minutes before using.</li>
            <li> I bought this from Amazon for my girlfriend and she said this is way cheaper on amazon then going to the stores, she loves this brand of wax warmers.</li>
            <li> It works great. I don&#x27;t really like the muslin strips that come included because the wax seeps through and makes your hands or gloves all sticky. Besides that, though, I love it. It warms up quickly and does a really great job</li>
            <li> works great.  heats up very nicely and delivers a wax that looks professionally done</li>
            <li> Very sticky, but quite effective.  Never use without the special powder that you apply under wax.  It is sold separately, but a must for this product.  Also, I advise that you get the wax remover cream, also sold separately. If this wax accidently gets on your hands, you will need the cream to remove it.</li>
            <li> Finally a do it yourself at home...thanks!</li>
            <li> This stuff does help to RIP off your hair, leaves me sore and red, but it does come off..</li>
            <li> Great product for the price. I love having my own personal waxing machine to use it wherever I want. This is the same exact product that the professional salons use. I will be saving hundreds of dollars by having my own.</li>
            <li> I love this item and so does my family. I recieved everything for a great price and is very easy to use</li>
            <li> Gigi wax machine, collars, muslin strips and baby oil are all required purchases.  The wax is extremely sticky!  This is the best product so far that has worked for me!  Transaction went very smooth!</li>
            <li> Great wax machine i use it all the time for customers and my self. Great price.Always keep it up right and don&#x27;t get any wax on the sides of it or you will have a heck of a mess</li>
            <li> After decades of going to a salon to get a lip wax, I can finally do it myself in the comfort of my own home. The only thing I would suggest is making sure you put paper or something down where you are working as the wax is hard to remove from surfaces. Other than this, I found it effective and it is so nice to be able to do it whenever I want.</li>
            <li> The product is great! It&#x27;s a great kit to have at home, saves me a lot of money.</li>
            <li> THIS REALLY WORKS GREAT.  THIS WILL PAY FOR ITSELF IN JUST A FEW MORE USES.  TAKES ABOUT 1/2 HOUR TO WARM UP THE WAX</li>
            <li> This is a great wax system, especially for beginner self-waxers like myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was easy to use and set up and took about 20-30 minutes for the wax to warm completely. I agree that the applicator sticks were pretty thin, but I had no issues using them to apply wax to my eyebrows or lip area. For larger areas such as underarm, bikini, or leg, they would definitely be too small. If I ever decide to wax those areas, I&#x27;ll buy larger applicators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strips were the perfect size for the face area (brows, lip, etc), but again they would be too small for larger areas of application. I suggest purchasing the larger strips for those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wax worked well and grabbed most of the hairs the first time around, some of the missed hairs could have just been from my inexperience versus the wax. I have sensitive skin and I had no issues or reactions to this wax (I am a veteran in getting my brows and lips waxed though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is with the wax tub itself. When I first tried opening it, the wax was firmly stuck to the lid. It took me forever to pry the lid off of the wax and I almost broke it while doing this. I then had to put the lid over the canister while it was heating (probably not recommended) in order to get the giant blob of wax that was stuck to the lid to come off. After I was finished with the waxing, I laid a piece of foil over the wax before putting the lid back on. I haven&#x27;t used it since so I don&#x27;t know how effective this will be. I really wish the canister was designed differently so that my issue doesn&#x27;t happen again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the wax container issues, I liked this wax warmer and felt like it was a great value.</li>
            <li> Got the package quickly,  I did have to buy thicker applicators and strips separately.. but def a good buy.. I would buy again and recomend to a friend..</li>
            <li> works great was easy to use even for me a first time user.  wax warms up quickly and maintains even heat</li>
            <li> Easy to prepare.  Just make sure you buy extra tape if you&#x27;re doing a man&#x27;s back.  Very sloppy to apply.  Make sure you take all precautions to prep the area correctly.  (not for a novice)  I recommend he lay down.  Baby powder helps a little (in regards to lessening the pain). We found that acetone helps to remove it from counter tops but be careful.  Use old towels or rags you don&#x27;t care about.</li>
            <li> warmer works well but I prefer different wax because it is very runny and hard to use but warmer works at perfect temperatures.</li>
            <li> I love my Gigi Wax warmer! I cannot count how many times I have used it instead of go to the salon. Its no hassle for me at all, and it saves the 30 or whatever bucks to go to someone else! It&#x27;s also great when you forget and need a wax last minute. Never regretted this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wax heats up fast! Not too messy. Always clean eyebrows. (&#x3D;</li>
            <li> Not too bad!!  Does a fantastic job on my mustache.  Not so great on the beard type hairs on my chin but will take out the long fine ones that grow there.  The smell is nice.  Plenty of strips for small jobs like the mustache area and eyebrows.  Need bigger strips for larger areas. Also need to remember to use powder and some wax remover, so you have to buy those separate.  Baby oil has worked for me to remove the excess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course it can be messy, it&#x27;s hot wax.  You can burn your skin if you keep trying a problem spot over and over.  That happened to my chin but I was just so frustrated.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not possible to give a 5 star review when I have half an eyebrow gone, but that&#x27;s not the warmer kit&#x27;s fault! This was my first time to try waxing. I watched a couple of videos. I toned first. I powdered the areas to be waxed (lip &amp; brows), I applied a thin layer of wax to one side of my upper lip, then pressed the strip, then held the skin, released my breath, and yanked. Success!!!! Did the other side, and then used the wax remover. All easy-peasy &amp; great. Now the eyebrows, but that darned wax is so sticky &amp; stringy! One brow went great. The next? Not so much! The strings of the wax kind of got over on my brow, and wham-o! Half the brow gone! Guess what? I&#x27;m not a pro! I laughed and laughed! Lips, legs, underarms? OK. But next time, I&#x27;m letting a pro do my brows, that is, if it grows back! ;-)</li>
            <li> This is OK. It doesn&#x27;t heat the wax very well.  The strips look a lot smaller than they actually are.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this wax warmer for a couple years and it works perfectly. The wax provided lasts years and the strips are cheap and easy to find at beauty stores. Great investment if your brow game is strong!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a long time and still have supplies. Like.. there&#x27;s still a ton of wax in it. I highly recommend this for the girl who&#x27;s not afraid to put hot wax on her own face and doesn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money going to the salon to have someone else do it for her everytime.</li>
            <li> I had to buy an adapter because it is a 230 volt Euro plug. The proper adapter that takes US 110 volt and makes it 230 volt is about $20.</li>
            <li> Not mine, wish I had hair to curl</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a Christmas gift so I&#x27;m not using it for myself, so I can&#x27;t right much good about the actually product except it looks very good. But it did arrive very fast which was great</li>
            <li> excellent system for waxing.  just make sure that your pot is NEVER tipped during non-use.  the wax does NOT harden all the way when its not heated and its a terrible mess to clean up.  we had to just purchase a new pot.</li>
            <li> Good product for the size and price. I just have to added larger and wider sticks for bigger areas to be treated. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I received the product on time.  It was what I was expecting.  My daughter has not used it yet so I can not comment on the use of the product.</li>
            <li> This item is not as pictured. There was no wax in the kit I received. Moreover, the sticks are barely larger than toothpicks -- they are useless for applying wax except perhaps on brows or fine detail work. The muslin strips are the size of 2 finger band-aids.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy as it came with plug not for U.S&lt;br /&gt;Adjusting up one star as I was taken care of my customer service who helped me locate an adapter for a great price. On the bright side if I ever tour Europe I have a wax warmer that will work :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do expect the review to go up after I get my adapter gets here and I get to try it out. I have seen these used in salons and I know that it worked...the key seems to be \\&quot;less is more\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This product is ok, for the money. The warmer is great, didn&#x27;t take much time at all to warm the wax, and it seems to be well made. The application sticks are cheesy, as other reviews have stated.&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint is there are two pamphlets of detailed instructions..and neither are in ENGLISH! If you&#x27;re going to sell a product here, make sure your customers don&#x27;t have to be bilingual!&lt;br /&gt;Part of the instruction, in the small booklet are in English..so..???</li>
            <li> Warmer works great.  The honee product used for waxing does not work well at all.  With several attempts, the hair is still there.  Recommend to find better wax to use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the honey wax, it&#x27;s too sticky and messy, however it all came just as expected and the rest of the materials are great.</li>
            <li> Takes forever to warm up and it was a sticky mess</li>
            <li> I saw this at a salon and am glad I got a quality one. The wax will last a while!</li>
            <li> It is a very good kit the warmer is good the wax is perfect. The only reason i gave it 4 star is i did not like the wood applicators they are so thin that often the wax is dripping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but overall very very nice product.</li>
