            <li>I&#x27;ve always been told I naturally smelled good anyway.  :D</li>
            <li>My brother in-law introduced me to Speick shaving cream; I liked the scent.  </li>
            <li>This soap is as good as or better than Dove at keeping my skin from drying out in the winter, without smelling feminine (even the Men&#x27;s Dove is too feminine to me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so my advise is to watch for it on Sale still its a good soap so buy and enjoy!</li>
            <li>The scent is great and it does clean and rinse off well</li>
            <li>well worth it to me and the delivery time is great.</li>

            <li>This is my favorite soap in the world.  </li>
            <li>If you order Speick you have used it before and know it is awesome compared to American soap products.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need to write much more about soap.</li>
            <li>really like Speick Soap as its great stuff</li>
            <li>I love this soap ...</li>
            <li>All the Speick products are top notch.</li>
            <li>These bars of soap cost more</li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>It is not too strong - I don&#x27;t smell like a flower when I leave the house - but it is plenty strong in the shower, and a wonderful thing to experience early in the morning.</li>
            <li>Good scent, lasts pretty well.</li>
            <li>All natural and great spicy, woodsy smell.</li>
            <li>Now I can easily get them here on Amzazon.  </li>
            <li>It is a strong manly smell(whatever that is).</li>
            <li>Speick has a unique smell and how you feel about that will decide how you feel abount the product because it&#x27;s strong and persistent...</li>
            <li>Great German soap.</li>
            <li>He was thrilled with the soap, something he really enjoys but does not purchase for himself.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably good soap if you have soft water.</li>
            <li>It has a nice refreshing herbal scent and does not dry my skin out.</li>
            <li>I believe their original ad mentioned it would reduce nervous tension</li>
            <li>Great smell and the soap lasts a relatively long time.</li>
            <li>At first the smell was overwhelming, but now I think I&#x27;m accustomed to it.  </li>
            <li>Love it thanks!</li>
            <li>Freshens me up well with a unique scent.</li>
            <li>It has a clean almost antiseptic aroma that stays with you but doesn&#x27;t overwhelm.</li>
            <li>It makes just the right amount of suds and you really have a nice clean feeling when you are done.</li>
            <li>Also a good product if you are trying to learn German like I am.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is definitely worth the price, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase them without getting the free shipping with orders for $35+</li>
            <li>The shipment arrived quickly and was well packaged.</li>
            <li>SUPER SOAP:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soap, and it gets me clean in all the right places.  </li>
            <li>Speick bar soap is flowery, kind of like gardenia, with something kind of &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34; or piquant too--just enough to be masculine.  </li>
            <li>is my first choice soap, bar none!</li>
            <li>is pretty cool.</li>
            <li>My wife is German and although we have lived both here in the USA and in Germany, my favorite bath soap is Speick.</li>
            <li>Awesome great to bad it a little up there in the price for just 3 bars of soap</li>
            <li>The instructions/details are both in German and English and it is good way to learn some new words.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t care what they bill it as.</li>
            <li>price is reasonable and I would buy it again.</li>
            <li>Not irritating on skin or drying on hair, IMO.</li>
            <li>fortunately it is the same (or so close</li>
            <li>Really like this product alot.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s pretty nice, a spicy, manly scent, and would probably cover some pretty serious BO, should you happen to need to do that.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Response to scent is highly subjective.</li>
            <li>I like the scent but other than that I have not noticed anything special about the soap, it does not lather better than other soaps, it may not leave a soap residue like some do</li>
            <li>and I find it has remained a \\&quot;keeper\\&quot; for me whereas I do grow tired of most colognes quickly.</li>
            <li>Although I love Speick shaving cream, I give the soap only three stars because it really does not last that long.  </li>
            <li>It is strong and I like it, but takes a little time to get used to.</li>
            <li>I really like it because it is distinctly different and herbal, don&#x27;t use it all the time due to price, but enjoy it when I do.</li>
            <li>bar is a bit smaller than average, in my opinion, and the price is more than average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has great fragnance and is really high quality made, but just only disadvantage is that it became 3 times expensive, compairing to 2009.</li>
            <li>but it seems like the bar of soap only lasts a little more than a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Completely unrelated to the soap itself...</li>
            <li>It smells like the solid shave soap but much stronger.  </li>
            <li>I have tried multiple commercial bar soap(s), most cause me to breakout, probably because they contain some of the same ingredients and only the fragrence is changed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of Speick products and this soap in particular.</li>
            <li>Toms of main would be my next choice.</li>
            <li>I will say that it can dry your skin if you really use it and often.</li>
            <li>The smell is unlike any other soap I&#x27;ve used, and without knowing why exactly, I now have Speick after shave, and</li>
            <li>Thankfully, Amazon, the Internet and the small entrepenuer who works through Amazon quickly provided the answer.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34;, but not dry.  </li>

            <li> It leaves my skin &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34;, but not dry.  </li>
            <li> The price is a little high but</li>
            <li> I have to say, like other reviewers, it is intriguing and hard to describe.</li>
            <li> Not really a pine scent but related.</li>
            <li> If you have designs on wearing any other fragrance after showering with Speick you should definitely reconsider, because nothing else will be noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received a little sample bar of this from an online store several years ago.  </li>
            <li> It does leave me feeling a little cleaner than regular bath soap, less of a film residue.</li>
            <li> After using this soap exclusively for the past 6 months, I can&#x27;t bring myself to go back to anything</li>
            <li> I think European standards restrict some of the ingredients that are commonly used in US brands.</li>
            <li> Seems like a soap you&#x27;ll either love or hate.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is subtle and faint afterwards -- just a clean scent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it five stars if it were less pricey.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey, though.</li>
            <li> I agree with comments about the 4$/bar price, which is a bit excessive for a 3.5oz personal-sized bar, but it&#x27;s still one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> as sadly prices are starting to creep up</li>
            <li> The bars are a bit small but they get the job done.</li>
            <li> With my hard water this soap does not rinse off well, but leaves a sticky, itchy film on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I like the subtle scent.</li>
            <li> Not sure I will buy it again because for 3 bars it&#x27;s a bit expensive, and I&#x27;m already through one.</li>
            <li> I like the company and the story behind it</li>
            <li> Too bad you can&#x27;t find it in the stores.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t leave the skin with that tacky feeling you get from so many soaps.&lt;br /&gt;This is my first choice soap, bar none!</li>
            <li> I love this soap! It has a great herbal fragrance and it is not drying at all. I have been using it for over a year and I would recommend it to everyone. I had no idea that it was advertised as a \\&quot;men&#x27;s\\&quot; soap until I reordered it on Amazon and it was billed as such. I really don&#x27;t care what they bill it as. All I know is that it is a great soap. And the company I ordered it from delivered it promptly and I would order again from this company.</li>
            <li> Speick has the best scent and feel of any soap I have ever tried (and i&#x27;ve tried a lot).  I  used to have to smuggle these across the border. Now I can easily get them here on Amzazon.  Great job Amazon.  Thank you Smallflower.</li>
            <li> Nice smell.  It does leave me feeling a little cleaner than regular bath soap, less of a film residue. I think European standards restrict some of the ingredients that are commonly used in US brands. It&#x27;s a little pricey, though.</li>
            <li> With my hard water this soap does not rinse off well, but leaves a sticky, itchy film on my skin.  It&#x27;s probably good soap if you have soft water.</li>
            <li> Best soap you can find in an orange box. Buy it.</li>
            <li> It is a strong manly smell(whatever that is). That is to say it is pleasant and not smelling like it came out of a pasture.&lt;br /&gt;The price is reasonable and I would buy it again. I believe their original ad mentioned it would reduce nervous tension ( I think it was this soap). Well, while I an not a nervous person it is making me nervous as I am waiting for the miracle to happen.</li>
            <li> Great smell and the soap lasts a relatively long time.</li>
            <li> My wife is German and although we have lived both here in the USA and in Germany, my favorite bath soap is Speick. It has a clean almost antiseptic aroma that stays with you but doesn&#x27;t overwhelm.When my last bar ran out this summer, panic ensued in our household. Thankfully, Amazon, the Internet and the small entrepenuer who works through Amazon quickly provided the answer. The price is a little high but well worth it to me and the delivery time is great. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Speick has a unique smell and how you feel about that will decide how you feel abount the product because it&#x27;s strong and persistent... I can still smell the soap from my morning shower at bedtime! If you have designs on wearing any other fragrance after showering with Speick you should definitely reconsider, because nothing else will be noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty nice, a spicy, manly scent, and would probably cover some pretty serious BO, should you happen to need to do that. Not irritating on skin or drying on hair, IMO. I agree with comments about the 4$/bar price, which is a bit excessive for a 3.5oz personal-sized bar, but it&#x27;s still one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Although I love Speick shaving cream, I give the soap only three stars because it really does not last that long.  The scent is great and it does clean and rinse off well but it seems like the bar of soap only lasts a little more than a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is worth trying the product though because the scent is excellent.</li>
            <li> I received a little sample bar of this from an online store several years ago.  I really liked it, but forgot what the brand name was.  When I saw it here, and saw the box, I knew I&#x27;d found it again.  I love the smell of this soap.  I use it for showering.  It leaves my skin &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34;, but not dry.  The fragrance is subtle and faint afterwards -- just a clean scent.  I see that you can get it in boxes of 12, which will be my next purchase.  When used with a nylon mesh shower scrub, it makes a lot of suds.  One &amp;#34;application&amp;#34; worked for the entire shower.  I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soap, and it gets me clean in all the right places.  At first the smell was overwhelming, but now I think I&#x27;m accustomed to it.  I don&#x27;t wear cologne so this is the closest I will get.  Not sure I will buy it again because for 3 bars it&#x27;s a bit expensive, and I&#x27;m already through one. Probably back to unscented Dr. Bronners.  I&#x27;ve always been told I naturally smelled good anyway.  :D</li>
            <li> This is a great bar of soap. Too bad you can&#x27;t find it in the stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Speick products and this soap in particular. It has a nice refreshing herbal scent and does not dry my skin out. I&#x27;d give it five stars if it were less pricey.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite soap in the world.  I used to get it regularly when I was in Germany.  Now I don&#x27;t visit there so often and so I ordered the soap on-line. Fabulous!!!</li>
            <li> My brother in-law introduced me to Speick shaving cream; I liked the scent.  I bought this soap hoping it would have the same scent even though it is a different category (the soap is their &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; line, the shaving cream is their &amp;#34;men&#x27;s&amp;#34; line)...fortunately it is the same (or so close I can&#x27;t tell).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each bar of this soap is lasting me about 1-1/2 weeks, about the same as the Dove soap I had been using.  This soap is as good as or better than Dove at keeping my skin from drying out in the winter, without smelling feminine (even the Men&#x27;s Dove is too feminine to me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this soap.  I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, lathers great. All I could want in a soap. Downside: it&#x27;s pricy.</li>
            <li> Great German soap. All natural and great spicy, woodsy smell. I will say that it can dry your skin if you really use it and often. I like the company and the story behind it is pretty cool. Also a good product if you are trying to learn German like I am. The instructions/details are both in German and English and it is good way to learn some new words. Completely unrelated to the soap itself...</li>
            <li> If you order Speick you have used it before and know it is awesome compared to American soap products.  Love it thanks!</li>
            <li> Awesome great to bad it a little up there in the price for just 3 bars of soap</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Don&#x27;t need to write much more about soap. Good scent, lasts pretty well. I bought it because I&#x27;ve used their men&#x27;s shaving cream for years.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t explain, even to myself, why I like Grappa. The taste is close to kerosene, but I like it.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t explain, even to myself, why I like Speick. I can&#x27;t say it smells good, but I like it. The smell is unlike any other soap I&#x27;ve used, and without knowing why exactly, I now have Speick after shave, and Speick shave soap.&lt;br /&gt;If you try it, you&#x27;ll probably like it a lot. Maybe the why part doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Speick Soap as a gift for my father-in-law (of German ancestry). He was thrilled with the soap, something he really enjoys but does not purchase for himself. The shipment arrived quickly and was well packaged. I have nothing but praise for this seller and recommend for others.</li>
            <li> Speick bar soap is flowery, kind of like gardenia, with something kind of &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34; or piquant too--just enough to be masculine.  It smells like the solid shave soap but much stronger.  It is not too strong - I don&#x27;t smell like a flower when I leave the house - but it is plenty strong in the shower, and a wonderful thing to experience early in the morning.</li>
            <li> SUPER SOAP:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like Speick Soap as its great stuff but I rate it at 4 Stars as sadly prices are starting to creep up so my advise is to watch for it on Sale still its a good soap so buy and enjoy!.....&lt;br /&gt;IndianaED</li>
            <li> Good soap with a great smell. The bars are a bit small but they get the job done.</li>
            <li> I am utilizing that soap about 5 years. It has great fragnance and is really high quality made, but just only disadvantage is that it became 3 times expensive, compairing to 2009.</li>
            <li> Great sent, excellent for sensetive skin. I have tried multiple commercial bar soap(s), most cause me to breakout, probably because they contain some of the same ingredients and only the fragrence is changed. This is a great soap for men. Toms of main would be my next choice.</li>
            <li> I love this soap ...the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> A great soap. Freshens me up well with a unique scent. Really like this product alot. All the Speick products are top notch.</li>
            <li> These bars of soap cost more but I find myself coming back to purchase them. After using this soap exclusively for the past 6 months, I can&#x27;t bring myself to go back to anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely worth the price, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase them without getting the free shipping with orders for $35+</li>
            <li> Con&lt;br /&gt;The bar is a bit smaller than average, in my opinion, and the price is more than average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&lt;br /&gt;Response to scent is highly subjective. I really like it because it is distinctly different and herbal, don&#x27;t use it all the time due to price, but enjoy it when I do. I recommend to others to try.</li>
            <li> A nice soap with a pleasant man scent.</li>
            <li> arrived wayyyyy faster than i expected.&lt;br /&gt;smells very different than traditional American soap. not at all flowery.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for the adventure of it. The packaging states part of the fragrance is from a plant harvested in the Alps called \\&quot;Speick\\&quot;. I have to say, like other reviewers, it is intriguing and hard to describe. Not really a pine scent but related. I tested the bar on my cats and they seemed intrigued as well and were not put off by it. It sticks with you through the day and I find it has remained a \\&quot;keeper\\&quot; for me whereas I do grow tired of most colognes quickly. I catch myself sniffing my forearm on occasion for the interest. I will buy this soap again.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of my grandfather.</li>
            <li> I like the subtle scent. I wish the bars lasted longer than they do, but you can&#x27;t have everything.</li>
            <li> I like the scent but other than that I have not noticed anything special about the soap, it does not lather better than other soaps, it may not leave a soap residue like some do but it appears to be negligible.</li>
            <li> Seems like a soap you&#x27;ll either love or hate.  It is strong and I like it, but takes a little time to get used to.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. It makes just the right amount of suds and you really have a nice clean feeling when you are done. I will buy this again.</li>
