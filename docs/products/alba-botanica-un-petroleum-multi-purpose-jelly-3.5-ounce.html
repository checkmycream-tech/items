            <li>Good thing</li>
            <li>After deciding not to use petroleum jelly (Vaseline) anymore, I set out to find a good substitute.</li>
            <li>This product works just like petroleum jelly, but is an all-natural hand/foot cream that you can feel good about using.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good stuff though.</li>
            <li>That might be a good thing though.  </li>
            <li>Product arrived in good contition and packaged well.  </li>
            <li>I loved the product but found it pricey for the amount of packaging.</li>
            <li>While a good moisturizer, this product does not smell good.  </li>

            <li>Both my husband and I are very happy with this product and think the price is right as well.</li>
            <li>just love it !</li>
            <li>This is a better alternative for baby!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>We love this product!</li>
            <li>I must say I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Like I said it performs JUST like vaseline does for me, so I love that!</li>
            <li>great stuff, not always easy to find.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This product is kind of sticky, but moisturizes well.</li>
            <li>It honestly looks and feels just like vaseline!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Kind of plastic-y?</li>
            <li>Good, because it makes me look even better in comparison.</li>
            <li>It forms a great barrier against the elements with beeswax, moisture rich coconut oil and soothing, protective vitamin E&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that it is an awesome multi-use product and a great go-to for different needs.</li>
            <li>Love having a safe alternative to vaseline!</li>
            <li>Although I love how nicely it works, it&#x27;s a pain to get it washed out of her clothes.</li>
            <li>The best part is that it is natural and safe.</li>
            <li>This one is effective, easy to rub in and not gooey.</li>
            <li>Very good for people with those allergies or with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I love this un-petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li>love this product .</li>
            <li>that I know is going to be better for me and my family.</li>
            <li>In fact, I buy 6 jars or so at a time to be sure not to run out of it since it seems to be &#x27;out of stock&#x27; more and more as people learn about it.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully, I won&#x27;t be throwing away more money by trying to salvage the tubes.  </li>
            <li>Many use it at night to seal in their pm cream.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s great for any skin type especially sensitive.</li>
            <li>but this is a much better alternative.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I wish I could say I don&#x27;t love vaseline</li>
            <li>I love it and my fave version is Aquaphor.</li>
            <li>Coconut oil alone seems to do a better job.</li>
            <li>It has the consistency of petroleum jelly and goes on smoothly, but its not as effective in clearing up the rash.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that someone has come up with an alternative to petroleum based jelly.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for un petroleum products for some time now and am glad amazon is carrying this product.</li>
            <li>it appears to be safe for babies( check latest labeling)&lt;br</li>
            <li>A lot of the ingredients are ingredients you will feel safe putting on your face.&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
            <li>even if you put lipstick on top of</li>
            <li>My face drinks it up, and my face is so smooth in the morning!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Not greasy, works great as chap stick, and dries fast.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>and it is not petroleum which is so much better for you.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great, and reasonably priced, too.</li>
            <li>works well, but i wish they gave more.</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s petroleum free!</li>
            <li>Love the ingredients list.</li>
            <li>Love it because it is petro free!</li>
            <li>I love Alba Botanica, but have no use for these now</li>
            <li>Love, love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and i end up mixing it with a more liquid lotion</li>
            <li>I love this Jelly.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>This ointment hasn&#x27;t ruined any cloth inserts and the daycare is able to use it.  </li>
            <li>I was very excited to get this &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a touch thicker than Vaseline, so it doesn&#x27;t absorb as easily, but that also makes it better for using it as a diaper cream (makes a thicker barrier for overnight use).</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s worked great to seal in moisture and keep the dryness at bay.</li>
            <li>They are not alone in that, many fragrance free products are that way.  </li>
            <li>I have been also using the Proactiv toner and treatment lotion along with the un-petroleum jelly and my skin has been happy so far.</li>
            <li>Excellent alternative to Aquaphor and other petroleum based products.</li>
            <li>The product has no scent and glides on easily.</li>
            <li>Now, Amazon has made it easy as can be.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t exactly easy.</li>
            <li>it works OK, not bad at all.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>(if I&#x27;m lucky!)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great deal for a super versatile product!</li>
            <li>A great natural product that does exactly what I needed it to!</li>
            <li>either which is a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li>, I wake up to baby smooth skin.</li>
            <li>Bought this as a petroleum free alternative to Aquaphore for my daughters rashy cheeks.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product- does all that petroleum jelly or Vaseline does but with no petroleum in it!&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>Fantastic all bearing the word</li>
            <li>Petro-chemical free, and also aloe vera/cactus free.</li>
            <li>I think this is a great product and alternative to traditional Petroleum Jelly.  </li>
            <li>great as an alternate to Vaseline</li>
            <li>As far as it goes as a petroleum jelly substitute it is superior.  </li>
            <li>right before bed to trap in the moisture from my other lotions/creams/balms, and it works great!</li>
            <li>This product is ok and was the first petroleum jelly substitute I ever tried.  </li>
            <li>Love this- clears up diaper rash fast!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>Worth a try!</li>
            <li>a clean washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has no added perfumes or scents.  </li>
            <li>The materials are clean and there is no chemical issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you can clean your make up off with it.</li>
            <li>~ See also my review for Now Foods EPO Massage Oil for another great dry skin remedy.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great if you have really dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, I feel better knowing that I am making a more environmentally conscious choice by not using an oil byproduct.</li>
            <li>and it also works great to moisturize the dry areas under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s natural and that it works better than vaseline.</li>
            <li>The price is right, too!</li>
            <li>She was right!  </li>
            <li>Also good on the back of the hands.</li>
            <li>Store in a cool place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t true.  </li>
            <li>This works better than vaseline and it&#x27;s much healthier for you than using petroleum products.</li>
            <li>Once I finished up yet another giant tub of vaseline, I knew it was probably time for me to get away from petroleum as well, so I decided to try this and see if it could compare with my beloved vaseline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No bad smell after that time.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for those of you who have children as it is a much &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; product than petroleum jelly and has many, many versatile uses.</li>
            <li>I just started using this on my face at night (as per Tyra, but healthier), and when I wake up I seriously look flawless.</li>
            <li>Alba&#x27;s sense of corporate responsibility is impressive, but it&#x27;s the product that counts above all else.  </li>
            <li>Better than the petroleum based product of my youth, Vaseline, I have used this product since the mid &#x27;90&#x27;s and love it.</li>
            <li>I quickly found out about Alba&#x27;s Un-Petroleum Jelly and decided to try it out.</li>
            <li>It soaks in rather quickly.</li>
            <li>Super hydrating, creamy, healing cream.</li>
            <li>and have been so pleasantly surprised to only have a positive experience, and I am really impressed!</li>
            <li>and have been so pleasantly surprised to only have a positive experience, and I am really impressed!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a good product and would recommend to anyone who uses oxygen or just has dry skin and doesn&#x27;t want to use petroleum-based products.</li>
            <li>Good for dry skin and diaper rash</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, works pretty much exactly the same as the petroleum jelly that I used to buy in the squeeze bottle, except that it seems a bit thicker when you first go to spread it.</li>
            <li>This is a great product I have been using for quite a few years.  </li>
            <li>It lasts for quite a few months, and is a great eye cream to use at night.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the money to know I&#x27;m using something</li>
            <li>I liked it enough for what it&#x27;s worth, but the product in the tubes I received seemed sticky.  </li>
            <li>It has outstanding, natural, healing ingredients, and there is nothing harmful in it.</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s a safer natural version of patroleum jelly.</li>
            <li>Perhaps when the weather is cooler and closed shoes are more in the mix, this will work more to ;my liking.</li>
            <li>it makes me smile.</li>
            <li>It is safe and natural, too.</li>
            <li>love the natural ingredients, and works well as a lip treatment overnight.</li>
            <li>Even better than plain coconut oil on its own.</li>
            <li>Castor oil makes a major appearance in the odor composition, but there is another more peculiar note to it.</li>
            <li>And I am sure it will only get harder after more and more of the product gets used up.</li>
            <li>Very few ingredients, which is great.</li>
            <li>I have used this on my lips for years, and they are never dry any more.</li>
            <li>It is clear and easy to apply and works well to prevent diaper rash.</li>
            <li>This is a very good product that can be very hard to find.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In fact, keeps lipstick on very much like a lipstick primer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!ient tube though because I like the more natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>This gentle formula works wonders for diaper rash!</li>
            <li>it actually works better than vaseline</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I have an alternative to the petroleum product but that this still does the same thing.</li>
            <li>I love this and cannot recommend it enough!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smell, at first it has a horrid castor oil smell, it fades after, about 10 mins.  </li>
            <li>Overall this product is safe since it doesn&#x27;t use chemical petrolatum that can have harmful health effects.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, and I love that it doesn&#x27;t small like anything,</li>
            <li>Everyone who tries it loves the feel and agrees it so nice NOT to smell the petrol smell.</li>
            <li>Much safer than vaseline!</li>
            <li>This product has the same consistency as petroleum jelly, but is substantially more hydrating and smoothing.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Of course she doesn&#x27;t like it, but it works ;)</li>
            <li>It has softened her skin a bit which is saying a lot because her eczema is pretty severe.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel soft and smooth</li>
            <li>And thanks to one click of the mouse at Amazon.com, I did!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what petroleum jelly did for me which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>but it really seals in moisture!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>The first 3 ingredients are castor seed oil, coconut oil and beeswax.</li>
            <li>First is the scent.</li>
            <li>Very similar texture to vasaline in texture, smell and color, but better for your skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it since the first time trying it.</li>
            <li>I have pretty finicky skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks very much</li>
            <li>The 9oz jar of WAXELEN lasts a long time for most but my household uses that size up</li>
            <li>pretty much just like vaseline does.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pure ingredients prevent anyone from breaking out</li>
            <li>Quite a bit more expensive than plain old petroleum jelly, but works beautifully for all health and beauty applications where I used to use petroleum jelly products but wanted something more naturally-derived.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>is an unscent product and glides very easily very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really gooey and tar like.</li>
            <li>my toddler has really chapped cheeks and chin -</li>
            <li>very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you use diaper rash ointment too much your baby might develop an allergy to it, which happened with both my girls.  </li>
            <li>So really depends on what you want to use it for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Works really well to protect my toddler&#x27;s eczema.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li>It really helps my hands when they get chapped and start to crack during the winter months.  </li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t really notice it helping them much.</li>
            <li>But it really doesn&#x27;t bother me that much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall though I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I really like the packaging too-</li>
            <li>This un-petroleum jelly is very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>For medical reasons I have to use as many natural products as possible, and this does fit the bill.</li>
            <li>Being such a versatile product, I use it frequently for many things (lips, cuticles, hand moisturizer, etc.)</li>
            <li>Once I read how many chemicals go in to producing commercial petroleum jelly, I knew I had to find a natural alternative.</li>
            <li>I put this on my hands last night, and this morning they were so amazingly soft and smooth!  </li>
            <li>Small quantity is really good to keep the skin dry and smooth.</li>
            <li>A little dab at every diaper change as a moisture-barrier has kept diaper rash at bay, and we feel good because we know we&#x27;re using a high quality, natural product.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m going to say that is has done close to nothing to keep my AA baby&#x27;s face from becoming dry.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t soothe them fast enough and I seem to still have to use original BLISTEX under it</li>
            <li>The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that it is fragrance free, which I have found does not mean it doesn&#x27;t have a scent, it means that it smells rather like chemicals, rather than perfume.  </li>
            <li>Better than any other product I have tried to treat that particular problem.  </li>
            <li>I mostly use it for my dry hands and to remove my eye makeup, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate or burn my sensitive eye area.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>Which is funny because this is an all natural product.</li>
            <li>It also has many other uses (see makeup artist Kandee Johnson&#x27;s tricks!</li>
            <li>The product was ok itself the only thing that bothered me was that when i recieved this product it was all bent up and the bottle looks like it is about to break from somebody bending it around or something :/ other rhan that the product was good and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>This came highly recommended by our pediatrician to treat diaper rash.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s all natural, which is why I decided to purchase this over other baby products on the market.</li>
            <li>but I love the WAXELENE and have used little else since I bought that.  </li>
            <li>It has coconut oil in it, a natural anti-fungul which is great for a dark wet diaper!</li>
            <li>So far I really like it.</li>
            <li>Works well although I noticed when we were away for the weekend and used it exclusively my baby started getting a bit of diaper rash, which he doesn&#x27;t normally.</li>
            <li>We love this Un-Petroleum have been using it for a few years now and always keep a couple tubes on hand.</li>
            <li>I am willing to pay a bit more and deal with the inconvenient tube though because I like the more natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin and was hoping this would really work quickly to soften the skin on my feet.  </li>
            <li>I mean the kind of hives that make a person look beat up and swell eyes shut.  </li>
            <li>My wife and I are always looking at ways to use the most natural products we can find on our little one.</li>
            <li>I live in a windy city</li>
            <li>I live in Florida</li>
            <li>Smell is odd, but very mild.</li>
            <li>It is less greasy, has MUCH healthier ingredients, leaves your skin very soft and soaks in faster and better than traditional Vaseline.</li>
            <li>It is no greasy and I use it pretty much daily!</li>
            <li>but this hasn&#x27;t so far!</li>
            <li>This is the way it should have been from the old days!</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product wish I could say differently, but I don&#x27;t find this as softening and moisturizing as plain petroleum jelly.  </li>
            <li>I try to live as natural of a lifestyle as I can and wanted to find a replacement to our vaseline.</li>
            <li>was looking for an overall good hydrating lotion, it is not good for setting it and forgetting it.  </li>
            <li>Very similar consistency to Vaseline, perhaps a little more watery.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li>so moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>It also seems to be completely odorless.</li>
            <li>It is gentle enough to use on children.</li>
            <li>(I wear drifit material when I run and the jelly washes out completely.</li>
            <li>I was looking for an all natural aquaphor substitute but this cream is not it.  </li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t make my sensitive skin break out</li>
            <li>Perhaps they were old, I don&#x27;t know.  </li>
            <li>It was nowhere near as greasy and it smelled like the plastic tube it came</li>
            <li>I really like this product, after using it in my lips as a balm for two weeks now I can see a different.</li>
            <li>Recommended for the eco-centric and natural minded parent.</li>
            <li>Also, it has a rather unusual smell, but that seems to fade shortly after application.</li>
            <li>but I do use it as an eye cream near the eye as it is quite emollient.</li>
            <li>I mix this with my lotion and body oil at night to put on my feet and keep them soft.</li>
            <li>(I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Petroleum-free, paraben-free and all natural - no synthetic fragrance or additives.</li>
            <li>It is not something I ever notice really unless I actually put the product up to my nose and smell it up close, but it has kind of an unappealing scent.</li>
            <li>Kept my skin soft.  </li>
            <li>I use this on my eczema and it has nearly healed it without steroids.</li>
            <li>Keeps skin soft.</li>
            <li>After applying it sparingly at night, I woke up to soft hydrated skin and no break-outs!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It also has this \\&quot;earthy/natural\\&quot; smell (probably from the coconut oil or something) that is not strong, but you may still be able to smell it after several hours.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I come across those lightly used tubes, I&#x27;ll either throw them out or transfer them into a jar and create a hair pomade or body cream by adding essential and natural oils,perhaps some shea or other butter and whipping to desired consistency because I don&#x27;t like wasting money.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Since you only need such a small amount, this tube will last a good while.</li>
            <li>I have no complaints when using it minimally, and it is very moisturizing as a lip cream!</li>
            <li>This product works really well on dry baby bottoms.</li>
            <li>She slathers it all over her face after using expensive creams to make sure they don&#x27;t rub off on her pillow!)</li>
            <li>This was my first choice to try out since it was cheaper than the other alternatives.</li>
            <li>so sandals are a major part of my footwear wardrobe.  </li>
            <li>I get very dry hands that tend to crack and bleed, and I have been trying to find a non-petroleum based product for intense moisturizer at night.</li>
            <li>This has the same texture as petroleum jelly, and I think it works nearly as well.  </li>
            <li>have been using it for several months now and have nothing but soft hydrated skin.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product as an alternative to petroluem jelly (we use Aquaphor when the usual Avalon Organics diaper cream--which we love--isn&#x27;t quite enough).</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product for people with dry and sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Un Petroleum Jelly goes on thick but does the job right!</li>
            <li>I get extremely dry hands in the winter time, and what I typically use this product for is to apply a light layer to my hands, lips, and the corners of my eyes (which get really dry also)</li>
            <li>It is nice how you can be sure you use every little bit of vaseline up in it&#x27;s container, but this I&#x27;m sure would impossible to do that (unless you are cutting open the tube, at which point it becomes a bit unsanitary.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this product as I used to use the old petro jelly....for dry skin, lips, and even to strengthen my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I am a former Vaseline addict, and over the past year or two I have been slowly switching all of my products towards more natural products.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s good stuff though.</li>

            <li> While a good moisturizer, this product does not smell good.  </li>

            <li> Both my husband and I are very happy with this product and think the price is right as well.</li>
            <li> just love it !</li>
            <li> This is a better alternative for baby!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> We love this product!</li>
            <li> I must say I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Like I said it performs JUST like vaseline does for me, so I love that!</li>
            <li> great stuff, not always easy to find.</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> This product is kind of sticky, but moisturizes well.</li>
            <li> It honestly looks and feels just like vaseline!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Kind of plastic-y?</li>
            <li> Good, because it makes me look even better in comparison.</li>
            <li> It forms a great barrier against the elements with beeswax, moisture rich coconut oil and soothing, protective vitamin E&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that it is an awesome multi-use product and a great go-to for different needs.</li>
            <li> Love having a safe alternative to vaseline!</li>
            <li> Although I love how nicely it works, it&#x27;s a pain to get it washed out of her clothes.</li>
            <li> The best part is that it is natural and safe.</li>
            <li> This one is effective, easy to rub in and not gooey.</li>
            <li> Very good for people with those allergies or with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love this un-petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> love this product .</li>
            <li> that I know is going to be better for me and my family.</li>
            <li> In fact, I buy 6 jars or so at a time to be sure not to run out of it since it seems to be &#x27;out of stock&#x27; more and more as people learn about it.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully, I won&#x27;t be throwing away more money by trying to salvage the tubes.  </li>
            <li> Many use it at night to seal in their pm cream.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s great for any skin type especially sensitive.</li>
            <li> but this is a much better alternative.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I wish I could say I don&#x27;t love vaseline</li>
            <li> I love it and my fave version is Aquaphor.</li>
            <li> Coconut oil alone seems to do a better job.</li>
            <li> It has the consistency of petroleum jelly and goes on smoothly, but its not as effective in clearing up the rash.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that someone has come up with an alternative to petroleum based jelly.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for un petroleum products for some time now and am glad amazon is carrying this product.</li>
            <li> it appears to be safe for babies( check latest labeling)&lt;br</li>
            <li> A lot of the ingredients are ingredients you will feel safe putting on your face.&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
            <li> even if you put lipstick on top of</li>
            <li> My face drinks it up, and my face is so smooth in the morning!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Not greasy, works great as chap stick, and dries fast.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> and it is not petroleum which is so much better for you.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, and reasonably priced, too.</li>
            <li> works well, but i wish they gave more.</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s petroleum free!</li>
            <li> Love the ingredients list.</li>
            <li> Love it because it is petro free!</li>
            <li> I love Alba Botanica, but have no use for these now</li>
            <li> Love, love this stuff.</li>
            <li> and i end up mixing it with a more liquid lotion</li>
            <li> I love this Jelly.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> This ointment hasn&#x27;t ruined any cloth inserts and the daycare is able to use it.  </li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a touch thicker than Vaseline, so it doesn&#x27;t absorb as easily, but that also makes it better for using it as a diaper cream (makes a thicker barrier for overnight use).</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s worked great to seal in moisture and keep the dryness at bay.</li>
            <li> They are not alone in that, many fragrance free products are that way.  </li>
            <li> I have been also using the Proactiv toner and treatment lotion along with the un-petroleum jelly and my skin has been happy so far.</li>
            <li> Excellent alternative to Aquaphor and other petroleum based products.</li>
            <li> The product has no scent and glides on easily.</li>
            <li> Now, Amazon has made it easy as can be.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t exactly easy.</li>
            <li> it works OK, not bad at all.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> (if I&#x27;m lucky!)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great deal for a super versatile product!</li>
            <li> A great natural product that does exactly what I needed it to!</li>
            <li> either which is a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li> , I wake up to baby smooth skin.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a petroleum free alternative to Aquaphore for my daughters rashy cheeks.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product- does all that petroleum jelly or Vaseline does but with no petroleum in it!&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Fantastic all bearing the word</li>
            <li> Petro-chemical free, and also aloe vera/cactus free.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great product and alternative to traditional Petroleum Jelly.  </li>
            <li> great as an alternate to Vaseline</li>
            <li> As far as it goes as a petroleum jelly substitute it is superior.  </li>
            <li> right before bed to trap in the moisture from my other lotions/creams/balms, and it works great!</li>
            <li> This product is ok and was the first petroleum jelly substitute I ever tried.  </li>
            <li> Love this- clears up diaper rash fast!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> Worth a try!</li>
            <li> a clean washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has no added perfumes or scents.  </li>
            <li> The materials are clean and there is no chemical issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you can clean your make up off with it.</li>
            <li> ~ See also my review for Now Foods EPO Massage Oil for another great dry skin remedy.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great if you have really dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, I feel better knowing that I am making a more environmentally conscious choice by not using an oil byproduct.</li>
            <li> and it also works great to moisturize the dry areas under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s natural and that it works better than vaseline.</li>
            <li> The price is right, too!</li>
            <li> She was right!  </li>
            <li> Also good on the back of the hands.</li>
            <li> Store in a cool place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t true.  </li>
            <li> This works better than vaseline and it&#x27;s much healthier for you than using petroleum products.</li>
            <li> Once I finished up yet another giant tub of vaseline, I knew it was probably time for me to get away from petroleum as well, so I decided to try this and see if it could compare with my beloved vaseline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No bad smell after that time.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for those of you who have children as it is a much &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; product than petroleum jelly and has many, many versatile uses.</li>
            <li> I just started using this on my face at night (as per Tyra, but healthier), and when I wake up I seriously look flawless.</li>
            <li> Alba&#x27;s sense of corporate responsibility is impressive, but it&#x27;s the product that counts above all else.  </li>
            <li> Better than the petroleum based product of my youth, Vaseline, I have used this product since the mid &#x27;90&#x27;s and love it.</li>
            <li> I quickly found out about Alba&#x27;s Un-Petroleum Jelly and decided to try it out.</li>
            <li> It soaks in rather quickly.</li>
            <li> Super hydrating, creamy, healing cream.</li>
            <li> and have been so pleasantly surprised to only have a positive experience, and I am really impressed!</li>
            <li> and have been so pleasantly surprised to only have a positive experience, and I am really impressed!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a good product and would recommend to anyone who uses oxygen or just has dry skin and doesn&#x27;t want to use petroleum-based products.</li>
            <li> Good for dry skin and diaper rash</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, works pretty much exactly the same as the petroleum jelly that I used to buy in the squeeze bottle, except that it seems a bit thicker when you first go to spread it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product I have been using for quite a few years.  </li>
            <li> It lasts for quite a few months, and is a great eye cream to use at night.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the money to know I&#x27;m using something</li>
            <li> I liked it enough for what it&#x27;s worth, but the product in the tubes I received seemed sticky.  </li>
            <li> It has outstanding, natural, healing ingredients, and there is nothing harmful in it.</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s a safer natural version of patroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> Perhaps when the weather is cooler and closed shoes are more in the mix, this will work more to ;my liking.</li>
            <li> it makes me smile.</li>
            <li> It is safe and natural, too.</li>
            <li> love the natural ingredients, and works well as a lip treatment overnight.</li>
            <li> Even better than plain coconut oil on its own.</li>
            <li> Castor oil makes a major appearance in the odor composition, but there is another more peculiar note to it.</li>
            <li> And I am sure it will only get harder after more and more of the product gets used up.</li>
            <li> Very few ingredients, which is great.</li>
            <li> I have used this on my lips for years, and they are never dry any more.</li>
            <li> It is clear and easy to apply and works well to prevent diaper rash.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product that can be very hard to find.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In fact, keeps lipstick on very much like a lipstick primer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!ient tube though because I like the more natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> This gentle formula works wonders for diaper rash!</li>
            <li> it actually works better than vaseline</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I have an alternative to the petroleum product but that this still does the same thing.</li>
            <li> I love this and cannot recommend it enough!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smell, at first it has a horrid castor oil smell, it fades after, about 10 mins.  </li>
            <li> Overall this product is safe since it doesn&#x27;t use chemical petrolatum that can have harmful health effects.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, and I love that it doesn&#x27;t small like anything,</li>
            <li> Everyone who tries it loves the feel and agrees it so nice NOT to smell the petrol smell.</li>
            <li> Much safer than vaseline!</li>
            <li> This product has the same consistency as petroleum jelly, but is substantially more hydrating and smoothing.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Of course she doesn&#x27;t like it, but it works ;)</li>
            <li> It has softened her skin a bit which is saying a lot because her eczema is pretty severe.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel soft and smooth</li>
            <li> And thanks to one click of the mouse at Amazon.com, I did!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what petroleum jelly did for me which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> but it really seals in moisture!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The first 3 ingredients are castor seed oil, coconut oil and beeswax.</li>
            <li> First is the scent.</li>
            <li> Very similar texture to vasaline in texture, smell and color, but better for your skin.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it since the first time trying it.</li>
            <li> I have pretty finicky skin.</li>
            <li> Thanks very much</li>
            <li> The 9oz jar of WAXELEN lasts a long time for most but my household uses that size up</li>
            <li> pretty much just like vaseline does.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pure ingredients prevent anyone from breaking out</li>
            <li> Quite a bit more expensive than plain old petroleum jelly, but works beautifully for all health and beauty applications where I used to use petroleum jelly products but wanted something more naturally-derived.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> is an unscent product and glides very easily very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really gooey and tar like.</li>
            <li> my toddler has really chapped cheeks and chin -</li>
            <li> very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you use diaper rash ointment too much your baby might develop an allergy to it, which happened with both my girls.  </li>
            <li> So really depends on what you want to use it for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> Works really well to protect my toddler&#x27;s eczema.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> It really helps my hands when they get chapped and start to crack during the winter months.  </li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t really notice it helping them much.</li>
            <li> But it really doesn&#x27;t bother me that much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall though I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really like the packaging too-</li>
            <li> This un-petroleum jelly is very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> For medical reasons I have to use as many natural products as possible, and this does fit the bill.</li>
            <li> Being such a versatile product, I use it frequently for many things (lips, cuticles, hand moisturizer, etc.)</li>
            <li> Once I read how many chemicals go in to producing commercial petroleum jelly, I knew I had to find a natural alternative.</li>
            <li> I put this on my hands last night, and this morning they were so amazingly soft and smooth!  </li>
            <li> Small quantity is really good to keep the skin dry and smooth.</li>
            <li> A little dab at every diaper change as a moisture-barrier has kept diaper rash at bay, and we feel good because we know we&#x27;re using a high quality, natural product.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m going to say that is has done close to nothing to keep my AA baby&#x27;s face from becoming dry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t soothe them fast enough and I seem to still have to use original BLISTEX under it</li>
            <li> The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that it is fragrance free, which I have found does not mean it doesn&#x27;t have a scent, it means that it smells rather like chemicals, rather than perfume.  </li>
            <li> Better than any other product I have tried to treat that particular problem.  </li>
            <li> I mostly use it for my dry hands and to remove my eye makeup, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate or burn my sensitive eye area.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> Which is funny because this is an all natural product.</li>
            <li> It also has many other uses (see makeup artist Kandee Johnson&#x27;s tricks!</li>
            <li> The product was ok itself the only thing that bothered me was that when i recieved this product it was all bent up and the bottle looks like it is about to break from somebody bending it around or something :/ other rhan that the product was good and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> This came highly recommended by our pediatrician to treat diaper rash.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s all natural, which is why I decided to purchase this over other baby products on the market.</li>
            <li> but I love the WAXELENE and have used little else since I bought that.  </li>
            <li> It has coconut oil in it, a natural anti-fungul which is great for a dark wet diaper!</li>
            <li> So far I really like it.</li>
            <li> Works well although I noticed when we were away for the weekend and used it exclusively my baby started getting a bit of diaper rash, which he doesn&#x27;t normally.</li>
            <li> We love this Un-Petroleum have been using it for a few years now and always keep a couple tubes on hand.</li>
            <li> I am willing to pay a bit more and deal with the inconvenient tube though because I like the more natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and was hoping this would really work quickly to soften the skin on my feet.  </li>
            <li> I mean the kind of hives that make a person look beat up and swell eyes shut.  </li>
            <li> My wife and I are always looking at ways to use the most natural products we can find on our little one.</li>
            <li> I live in a windy city</li>
            <li> I live in Florida</li>
            <li> Smell is odd, but very mild.</li>
            <li> It is less greasy, has MUCH healthier ingredients, leaves your skin very soft and soaks in faster and better than traditional Vaseline.</li>
            <li> It is no greasy and I use it pretty much daily!</li>
            <li> but this hasn&#x27;t so far!</li>
            <li> This is the way it should have been from the old days!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product wish I could say differently, but I don&#x27;t find this as softening and moisturizing as plain petroleum jelly.  </li>
            <li> I try to live as natural of a lifestyle as I can and wanted to find a replacement to our vaseline.</li>
            <li> was looking for an overall good hydrating lotion, it is not good for setting it and forgetting it.  </li>
            <li> Very similar consistency to Vaseline, perhaps a little more watery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li> so moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li> It also seems to be completely odorless.</li>
            <li> It is gentle enough to use on children.</li>
            <li> (I wear drifit material when I run and the jelly washes out completely.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an all natural aquaphor substitute but this cream is not it.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t make my sensitive skin break out</li>
            <li> Perhaps they were old, I don&#x27;t know.  </li>
            <li> It was nowhere near as greasy and it smelled like the plastic tube it came</li>
            <li> I really like this product, after using it in my lips as a balm for two weeks now I can see a different.</li>
            <li> Recommended for the eco-centric and natural minded parent.</li>
            <li> Also, it has a rather unusual smell, but that seems to fade shortly after application.</li>
            <li> but I do use it as an eye cream near the eye as it is quite emollient.</li>
            <li> I mix this with my lotion and body oil at night to put on my feet and keep them soft.</li>
            <li> (I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Petroleum-free, paraben-free and all natural - no synthetic fragrance or additives.</li>
            <li> It is not something I ever notice really unless I actually put the product up to my nose and smell it up close, but it has kind of an unappealing scent.</li>
            <li> Kept my skin soft.  </li>
            <li> I use this on my eczema and it has nearly healed it without steroids.</li>
            <li> Keeps skin soft.</li>
            <li> After applying it sparingly at night, I woke up to soft hydrated skin and no break-outs!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It also has this \\&quot;earthy/natural\\&quot; smell (probably from the coconut oil or something) that is not strong, but you may still be able to smell it after several hours.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I come across those lightly used tubes, I&#x27;ll either throw them out or transfer them into a jar and create a hair pomade or body cream by adding essential and natural oils,perhaps some shea or other butter and whipping to desired consistency because I don&#x27;t like wasting money.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since you only need such a small amount, this tube will last a good while.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints when using it minimally, and it is very moisturizing as a lip cream!</li>
            <li> This product works really well on dry baby bottoms.</li>
            <li> She slathers it all over her face after using expensive creams to make sure they don&#x27;t rub off on her pillow!)</li>
            <li> This was my first choice to try out since it was cheaper than the other alternatives.</li>
            <li> so sandals are a major part of my footwear wardrobe.  </li>
            <li> I get very dry hands that tend to crack and bleed, and I have been trying to find a non-petroleum based product for intense moisturizer at night.</li>
            <li> This has the same texture as petroleum jelly, and I think it works nearly as well.  </li>
            <li> have been using it for several months now and have nothing but soft hydrated skin.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product as an alternative to petroluem jelly (we use Aquaphor when the usual Avalon Organics diaper cream--which we love--isn&#x27;t quite enough).</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for people with dry and sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Un Petroleum Jelly goes on thick but does the job right!</li>
            <li> I get extremely dry hands in the winter time, and what I typically use this product for is to apply a light layer to my hands, lips, and the corners of my eyes (which get really dry also)</li>
            <li> It is nice how you can be sure you use every little bit of vaseline up in it&#x27;s container, but this I&#x27;m sure would impossible to do that (unless you are cutting open the tube, at which point it becomes a bit unsanitary.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this product as I used to use the old petro jelly....for dry skin, lips, and even to strengthen my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I am a former Vaseline addict, and over the past year or two I have been slowly switching all of my products towards more natural products.</li>
            <li> Has completely eradicated diaper rash and other types of rash.</li>
            <li> Second of all it left this strange film on my hands..</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ve seen any real changes.  </li>
            <li> First off the smell...it legit smelled like something had incubated itself inside the tube and died a slow death.</li>
            <li> i normally would use just plain coconut oil -</li>
            <li> I have been using it on my dry and cracked heels, and it has made such a difference.  </li>
            <li> I use it for my babies dry face multiple times a day!</li>
            <li> Lately some of the other products we&#x27;ve used he says hurts him, however, this product actually soothes him and is the only thing he wants us to use!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s plant based as well, all natural with no parabans, sulfates or artificial colors and 100% vegan,  so no crazy chemicals to worry about either!  </li>
            <li> during my long runs.</li>
            <li> Sometimes by itself, other times mixed into a homemade concoction.  </li>
            <li> I was very wary of using this because I know coconut oil can cause breakouts for a lot of people, but I haven&#x27;t had problems with this so far, and it has been extremely gentle with my sensitive, irritated skin.</li>
            <li> It is sticky and also smells very strange.</li>
            <li> Another plus is I don&#x27;t feel bad if I have to put it on him multiple times a day. :-)</li>
            <li> so my hands and the areas around my nose and mouth tend to get really dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t crack and dry out.</li>
            <li> I apply the unpetroleum jelly at night and it helps to repair the dry skin, I also use on my heels.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to keep in my handbag for dry lips.  </li>
            <li> I have also put it in my face with a lotion to go to bed and it has helped my dry face.</li>
            <li> I use it nightly on my lips and even put a coat around my eyes, which are terribly dry.</li>
            <li> , I have to sit 20 min for it to dry because of the thickness and oily quality.  </li>
            <li> However, if I had really dry feet</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive and might just do the trick for you if you&#x27;re battling a dry skin situation that&#x27;s not responding to anything else.</li>
            <li> I have ever used for dry hands and feet,&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li> my face, for diaper rash, for dry spots on animals . . . .  </li>
            <li> its dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> Put it on your dry, cracked feet and hands.  </li>
            <li> I use it for my face, burns, rashes, dry spots, ect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also gentle around the delicate eye area (still be careful not to get IN the eye)</li>
            <li> It leaves skin a little greasy, but that doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> It is tasteless and so easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Any place that can get dry and rough.  </li>
            <li> My six month old has not yet had a diaper rash, because whenever we see a little bit of red, I use the unpetroleum jelly and it&#x27;s gone in a few days!  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> he had very dry</li>
            <li> so when the tube is getting empty, I simply cut off the end of it and use a small scraper to get out every last bit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a little miracle tube!&lt;br /&gt;Since it is a very thick formula, I would use this only as a night time face moisturizer because it can be a little sticky/shiny right after applying.</li>
            <li> This stuff wasn&#x27;t bad, it&#x27;s just that the consistency comes close to &#x27;VASELINE&#x27; but WAXELENE does it better for my needs.  </li>
            <li> In addition, this is a terrific substitute for regular petroleum jelly for protecting a baby&#x27;s delicate skin from diaper rash.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No thanks.</li>
            <li> I thought I would give this a try since I didn&#x27;t really care for the residue my Aquaphor was leaving behind..</li>
            <li> The tube has lasted longer than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I feel so much better using a non-petroleum base product, especially for eye make up removal.</li>
            <li> I live in Michigan and this past winter has been really harsh on my skin..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to use regular petroleum jelly because of the mineral oil it is made from, as well as the unnecessary chemical additives that it frequently contains, most especially fragrance, which in my opinion simply stinks, and is just another unnecessary, indoor-air, allergy-stimulating pollutant.</li>
            <li> My lips are less dry.</li>
            <li> I have not tried this product on other materials.)</li>
            <li> but I was so excited to try it only to be disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> It is extremely sticky and oily and does not provide any hydration.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To protect and soothe not just lips but chapped cheeks and hands and any other body parts exposed to wind and sun.</li>
            <li> The other thing is the tube it comes in.</li>
            <li> Thank God for friends that care about each other or I would still be suffering.</li>
            <li> behaves like conventional petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> But since it worked wonders on my rough chapped hands from work and the cold winter months, and it is made of natural ingredients that other facial products use anyway, I gave it a go.</li>
            <li> I does an average job for the dryness I have on my face</li>
            <li> I have previously purchased another brand of &amp;#</li>
            <li> Safer and less suspicious than products like aquaphor.</li>
            <li> I use this on my son and it has a slight peanut oil smell</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this cream for our little one since she was born.</li>
            <li> A little dab will do ya!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you find that your skin is a little sticky, just pat with</li>
            <li> I put it in little jars that  I keep in my purse, pocket, and all over the house</li>
            <li> I was SO excited to get this, unfortunately it was giant FAIL!</li>
            <li> We use it every night as a diaper barrier for the little one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little tacky feeling</li>
            <li> This is very very sticky!This is very difficult to rub into skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an equal exchange minus the toxic issues related to what was once essentially crude oil.</li>
            <li> When I smoothed it into my hands and lips, it felt heavy and sticky and not emoillent</li>
            <li> was a bit skeptical when i saw caster oil was an ingredient in this product as i dont like its smell...but was pleasantly surprised..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this instead for a few years</li>
            <li> I like that this isn&#x27;t derived as a waste product from refining oil.</li>
            <li> I was kind of expecting the worst with this product (skin reactions, etc.)</li>
            <li> I was kind of expecting the worst with this product (skin reactions, etc.)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my kiddo had a reaction to this jelly and ended up with a horrible rash (bright red everywhere with small bumps) that would not go away.</li>
            <li> Just it being extremely sticky does not make it &amp;#34;petroleum jelly like&amp;#34;, if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> I tried this for at least 3 nights with cotton gloves and it actually seemed to make my hands worse somehow.</li>
            <li> A little hard to move, works well with oil blended.</li>
            <li> I applied the jelly and no more chafing.</li>
            <li> did NOT love this product or those tubes</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> and usually run out of it before its expiration date.</li>
            <li> the tube is so small for the price you pay.</li>
            <li> I make lip balms and decided to use coconut oil and a small amount of bees wax instead.</li>
            <li> But anyway, I also like using it on my lips and the hydration this stuff is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> It is about as thick as ordinary Vaseline, so it tends to stay where you put it.  </li>
            <li> Is hard to rub into hands.</li>
            <li> It is hard to get it all out of the tube</li>
            <li> hard to rub</li>
            <li> so it dosn&#x27;t have any mineral oil, parabens, sulfates, any of that icky stuff in it</li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve been using it as an under eye night mask and on my lips</li>
            <li> Like it , but little difficult to squeeze from the tube.</li>
            <li> ( Read on the internet why petroleum jelly is not exactly a good</li>
            <li> I finally threw it away:(  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not happy with this purchase...</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to use it as a moisturizer for my face because it is a really thick formula.</li>
            <li> Sorry, ALBA UN-PETROLEUM.is helps.  </li>
            <li> Sorry, ALBA UN-PETROLEUM.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I could not get over the smell.  </li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t put my finger on it, but it almost smells fake?</li>
            <li> Has a weird smell to it, but I think its from the castor oil.</li>
            <li> So disappointing.</li>
            <li> like that this product has no petrolatum, artificial colors/fragrances, parabens or phthalates and that they don&#x27;t test on animals.</li>
            <li> My friends are asking me what crazy things I&#x27;m doing, and they don&#x27;t believe me when I tell them I slather unpetroleum jelly on my face before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> A friend I used to work with got on my FB page after seeing the horrible trouble I was dealing with in the way of hives.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product!</li>
            <li> Just as bad as pertroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> The smell is still bad, but it does moisturize well</li>
            <li> Smells like peanutbutter which I personally hate</li>
            <li> i should have known I hate that stuff).</li>
            <li> Hydrogenated oil is bad for the heart, and makes you feel horrible.</li>
            <li> I hated it.</li>
            <li> However I was very disappointed to find that it has hydrogenated caster oil in it.</li>
            <li> Worst of all, it does nothing for my dry/crack hands.</li>
            <li> I was miserable.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> a great substitute for petroleum based Vaseline.</li>
            <li> Great for lips and foot heels.  No fragrance smell</li>
            <li> This gentle formula works wonders for diaper rash! As soon as I put this on my son, he instantly had relief! The scent is almost non-existent, which is a bonus.</li>
            <li> I apply this product at night before sleep. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer. Also good on the back of the hands.</li>
            <li> I love this un-petroleum jelly. I try to live as natural of a lifestyle as I can and wanted to find a replacement to our vaseline. This works wonderfully! Both my husband and I are very happy with this product and think the price is right as well. Now that it is winter, we are using it daily.</li>
            <li> just love it ! its a great replacement for vaseline.... it actually works better than vaseline</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff! It&#x27;s all natural so it dosn&#x27;t have any mineral oil, parabens, sulfates, any of that icky stuff in it and it leaves my skin so moisturized and soft. I have very dry skin so I put this on at night after all my moisturizers and I wake up feeling so good!</li>
            <li> Alba&#x27;s sense of corporate responsibility is impressive, but it&#x27;s the product that counts above all else.  And this one is quite good.  It is about as thick as ordinary Vaseline, so it tends to stay where you put it.  I find it to be a very good lubricant for use between and under my toes before running. and it doesn&#x27;t stain my socks.  It also seems to be completely odorless.</li>
            <li> Great product! No fragrance and it has great ingredients. I bought this to put around my nostrils and mouth to keep my tretinoin prescription cream from drying out the skin around my noise and mouth.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband who used oxygen 24/7. It was great for his nose and lips because it contains no petroleum, which you cannot use with oxygen. He loved it. Used it on his arms, hands, legs - he had very dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good product and would recommend to anyone who uses oxygen or just has dry skin and doesn&#x27;t want to use petroleum-based products.</li>
            <li> Not as greasy as vaseline, pleasant smell, gets good EWG score, I use it on my hands at night.</li>
            <li> The Unpetroleum Jelly from Alba is simply wonderful! I live in a windy city so my hands and the areas around my nose and mouth tend to get really dry and flaky. I apply the Unpetroleum Jelly at night and it helps to repair the damage done by the wind. I also use it on my heels and on my cuticles. The product has no scent and glides on easily. It is gentle enough to use on children. I wouldn&#x27;t use the Unpetroleum Jelly on the face during the day, because despite being made without any petroleum jelly, it is still greasy.&lt;br /&gt;*Special note for runners: This is great at preventing chafing. I was getting a rash under my armpits and on my back (sports bra) during my long runs. I applied the jelly and no more chafing. (I wear drifit material when I run and the jelly washes out completely. I have not tried this product on other materials.)</li>
            <li> great price for this product....can&#x27;t beat the price at any local store!</li>
            <li> This product works really well on dry baby bottoms. My six month old has not yet had a diaper rash, because whenever we see a little bit of red, I use the unpetroleum jelly and it&#x27;s gone in a few days!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my regular petroleum jelly that I apply to my hands during winter months so they don&#x27;t crack and dry out. After reading a lot of good reviews, I have to say that this product is not that great. Is hard to rub into hands. Worst of all, it does nothing for my dry/crack hands. Will never buy again.</li>
            <li> I apply the unpetroleum jelly at night and it helps to repair the dry skin, I also use on my heels. is an unscent product and glides very easily very moisturizing. love this product .</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product wish I could say differently, but I don&#x27;t find this as softening and moisturizing as plain petroleum jelly.  It will work in a pinch though.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this cream for our little one since she was born. She has never had a diaper rash, ever. No perfumes, no irritants. Wouldn&#x27;t switch anything for this product!</li>
            <li> I was looking for an all natural aquaphor substitute but this cream is not it.  It&#x27;s really gooey and tar like. It doesn&#x27;t absorb well and feels gross on the skin.</li>
            <li> Works great! Perfect substitute for petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> Un Petroleum Jelly goes on thick but does the job right! I put it on before I go to bed and after 8 hours of sleep (if I&#x27;m lucky!), I wake up to baby smooth skin. It also doesn&#x27;t make my sensitive skin break out either which is a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li> Looked like an awesome product, but then I saw it has soybean oil!!! How could they??? Just as bad as pertroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to keep in my handbag for dry lips.  After using this for about 6 weeks now, I found it has not helped at all.</li>
            <li> my toddler has really chapped cheeks and chin - I bought this with the intent to heal up his dryness. So far it&#x27;s worked great to seal in moisture and keep the dryness at bay. I love that it&#x27;s all natural, which is why I decided to purchase this over other baby products on the market. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and plan on using it as my go to when it comes to his chapped skin.</li>
            <li> Amazing. Apply it to your lips for a glossy effect</li>
            <li> I have loved this product for over two years and reorder when needed. It is no greasy and I use it pretty much daily!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use Vaseline often but when I do I worry about all the toxins in petroleum and wanted to find a healthier alternative. This stuff is great. It goes on smooth and lasts for a long time. I only wish I had found this sooner.</li>
            <li> I used this to make lip gloss with and I loved it!! I love the fact that I have an alternative to the petroleum product but that this still does the same thing. Yes, it is pricier but to me it&#x27;s worth the money to know I&#x27;m using something that I know is going to be better for me and my family.</li>
            <li> Great rating by EWG. I was using Burts Bees and read the ingredients of their &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; ointment. No thanks. This is a better alternative for baby! Good for dry skin and diaper rash</li>
            <li> This is a great product I have been using for quite a few years.  It lasts for quite a few months, and is a great eye cream to use at night.  Store in a cool place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is great to moisturize your hands, elbows, feet or face.  Any place that can get dry and rough.  A little dab will do ya!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you find that your skin is a little sticky, just pat with a clean washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has no added perfumes or scents.  Keep your skin protected in colder weather...</li>
            <li> This product is ok and was the first petroleum jelly substitute I ever tried.  I liked it enough for what it&#x27;s worth, but the product in the tubes I received seemed sticky.  Perhaps they were old, I don&#x27;t know.  I don&#x27;t recall a date on the tubes.  I&#x27;ll have to look again.  When I smoothed it into my hands and lips, it felt heavy and sticky and not emoillent enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did NOT love this product or those tubes would be gone by now.  I have them, somewhere, in the back of the linen closet perhaps or tucked away in a box of unused toiletries.  I&#x27;ll use it before petroleum jelly but I love the WAXELENE and have used little else since I bought that.  In fact, I buy 6 jars or so at a time to be sure not to run out of it since it seems to be &#x27;out of stock&#x27; more and more as people learn about it.  I use it from hair to toe.  Sometimes by itself, other times mixed into a homemade concoction.  The 9oz jar of WAXELEN lasts a long time for most but my household uses that size up very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This ALBA UN-PETROLEUM looks like petroleum jelly but what I received did not glide or have the same slip I was expecting.  It was nowhere near as greasy and it smelled like the plastic tube it came in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I come across those lightly used tubes, I&#x27;ll either throw them out or transfer them into a jar and create a hair pomade or body cream by adding essential and natural oils,perhaps some shea or other butter and whipping to desired consistency because I don&#x27;t like wasting money.  Hopefully, I won&#x27;t be throwing away more money by trying to salvage the tubes.  I want to try to get a return on my investment.  This stuff wasn&#x27;t bad, it&#x27;s just that the consistency comes close to &#x27;VASELINE&#x27; but WAXELENE does it better for my needs.  I have issues with WAXELENE too on my lips when they are split.  It doesn&#x27;t soothe them fast enough and I seem to still have to use original BLISTEX under it but otherwise, especially on my hands, WAXELENE is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.  Sorry, ALBA UN-PETROLEUM.is helps.  Sorry, ALBA UN-PETROLEUM.</li>
            <li> This is an incredible product that keeps moisture in and prevents it from escaping.  Many use it at night to seal in their pm cream. It&#x27;s pure ingredients prevent anyone from breaking out so it&#x27;s great for any skin type especially sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have used this on my lips for years, and they are never dry any more. It is tasteless and so easy to apply. I put it in little jars that  I keep in my purse, pocket, and all over the house so that&#x27;s it always there when I need it. It is hard to get it all out of the tube so when the tube is getting empty, I simply cut off the end of it and use a small scraper to get out every last bit. Couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I love this and cannot recommend it enough!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Put this on each diaper change and she doesn&#x27;t get diaper rash.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, after using it in my lips as a balm for two weeks now I can see a different. My lips are less dry. Perfect for winder time. I have also put it in my face with a lotion to go to bed and it has helped my dry face. I would recommend this product for people with dry and sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> This product works like it is supposed to.  Unfortunately I could not get over the smell.  I even tried adding some essential oils to it.  Nothing could mask the nauseating smell.  I finally threw it away:(  I prefer Aquaphor.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to use regular petroleum jelly because of the mineral oil it is made from, as well as the unnecessary chemical additives that it frequently contains, most especially fragrance, which in my opinion simply stinks, and is just another unnecessary, indoor-air, allergy-stimulating pollutant. I have previously purchased another brand of &amp;#34;un-petroleum&amp;#34; jelly besides this one, but I couldn&#x27;t find it again, and I was very happy to discover on Amazon this excellent alternative. It has outstanding, natural, healing ingredients, and there is nothing harmful in it. I am also happy to report that it has no scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I myself use this product as a very effective lip balm. In addition, this is a terrific substitute for regular petroleum jelly for protecting a baby&#x27;s delicate skin from diaper rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Castor oil, Coconut oil, Beeswax, Castorwax, Soybean Oil, Tocopheryl Acetate and Tocopherol (Vitamin E)</li>
            <li> This came highly recommended by our pediatrician to treat diaper rash. Very few ingredients, which is great. Has completely eradicated diaper rash and other types of rash. Safer and less suspicious than products like aquaphor. Recommended for the eco-centric and natural minded parent.</li>
            <li> The product was ok itself the only thing that bothered me was that when i recieved this product it was all bent up and the bottle looks like it is about to break from somebody bending it around or something :/ other rhan that the product was good and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Great value! Love that it&#x27;s a safer natural version of patroleum jelly. Patroleum jelly makes my face break out but this hasn&#x27;t so far! I mostly use it for my dry hands and to remove my eye makeup, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate or burn my sensitive eye area. I heard about this through beauty YouTuber Kandee Johnson and she said its one of her all time fav products and at this price I had to get it. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product as an alternative to petroluem jelly (we use Aquaphor when the usual Avalon Organics diaper cream--which we love--isn&#x27;t quite enough). Unfortunately, my kiddo had a reaction to this jelly and ended up with a horrible rash (bright red everywhere with small bumps) that would not go away. We ended up having to go to the pediatric dermatologist who gave a us a prescription to rub on every diaper change for the next two weeks. Talk about a pain (for us and him!)</li>
            <li> I use this on my baby&#x27;s bottom and it&#x27;s the best stuff to prevent diaper rash.  If you use diaper rash ointment too much your baby might develop an allergy to it, which happened with both my girls.  So for daily use, I use this un-petrolum jelly, and if a rash appears (which doesn&#x27;t happen often) I use the diaper rash ointment.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice alternative to &amp;#34;Vaseline&amp;#34;.  Used lots of Alba Botanica Un-Petroleum Multi-Purpose Jelly during our RV trip to the SouthWest, this winter &amp; it soothed my nasal passages well.  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> This is great stuff! I&#x27;m not totally opposed to Vaseline but this is a much better alternative. It is easy to apply and goes on smoothly. I&#x27;m using it for eczema and if seems to be clearing it up. I like it.</li>
            <li> This product contains hydrogenated castor oil.  If you use it as a lip balm, it will get in yor mouth and you will end up swallowing it.  You don&#x27;t have to butter your bread with something to get it in your mouth.  Hydrogenated oil is bad for the heart, and makes you feel horrible.</li>
            <li> I used this to make a list balm, wonderful. I love it. Even better than plain coconut oil on its own.</li>
            <li> Love this- clears up diaper rash fast!</li>
            <li> works as directed.  No scent and wonderfu for those of us who don&#x27;t want petroleum all over us!  YUCK!  stick wtih this one, works just as well and safer for all</li>
            <li> Great product. Good for oxygen users</li>
            <li> I wish I could say I don&#x27;t love vaseline but that&#x27;s lie. I love it and my fave version is Aquaphor. I bought this hoping I could move away from vaseline but this just does not get the job done. I does an average job for the dryness I have on my face but it does not last and I find myself having to reapply often. I also feel it is making the area drier. Such a shame. Coconut oil alone seems to do a better job.</li>
            <li> I used to use petroleum jelly every night to keep my lips protected at night. After hearing how great this was (and petroleum wasn&#x27;t), I switched over to Alba. I love it! I use it nightly on my lips and even put a coat around my eyes, which are terribly dry. My skin soaks up the moisture and feels great. Definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product! I&#x27;ve been using it for years for all different things but recently started using it as diaper cream for my son. It has coconut oil in it, a natural anti-fungul which is great for a dark wet diaper!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a petroleum free alternative to Aquaphore for my daughters rashy cheeks. It has the consistency of petroleum jelly and goes on smoothly, but its not as effective in clearing up the rash.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like motor oil. The consistency is similar to petroleum jelly, and worked well, but I couldn&#x27;t get pat the scent.</li>
            <li> great stuff, not always easy to find.</li>
            <li> As far as it goes as a petroleum jelly substitute it is superior.  The materials are clean and there is no chemical issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for an overall good hydrating lotion, it is not good for setting it and forgetting it.  Say I want to apply it to my hands, I have to sit 20 min for it to dry because of the thickness and oily quality.  However, if I had really dry feet it&#x27;d be excellent to hydrate, say putting socks over the foot after.  So really depends on what you want to use it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell, at first it has a horrid castor oil smell, it fades after, about 10 mins.  No bad smell after that time.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that someone has come up with an alternative to petroleum based jelly.  I use this product all day on lips, hands, feet, etc.  The product is wonderful and has no smell.</li>
            <li> This is very very sticky!This is very difficult to rub into skin.I am not sure if I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I did not get this from Amazon but I was so excited to try it only to be disappointed with it. It is extremely sticky and oily and does not provide any hydration. Just it being extremely sticky does not make it &amp;#34;petroleum jelly like&amp;#34;, if you know what I mean. I hated it. Will never buy it again. The only product that came close to petroleum jelly in the texture, feel, protection properties and staying power is lanolin.</li>
            <li> was a bit skeptical when i saw caster oil was an ingredient in this product as i dont like its smell...but was pleasantly surprised..no scent at all!  very nice lubricating jelly...highly recommend!</li>
            <li> We use this jelly especially in winter to protect our  children&#x27;s skin. Also a bit of the jelly makes it easier to take their  rectal temperature. Overall this product is safe since it doesn&#x27;t use chemical petrolatum that can have harmful health effects.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, and I love that it doesn&#x27;t small like anything, if it actually smelled like coconut, I don&#x27;t think I could use it. I was very wary of using this because I know coconut oil can cause breakouts for a lot of people, but I haven&#x27;t had problems with this so far, and it has been extremely gentle with my sensitive, irritated skin.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for un petroleum products for some time now and am glad amazon is carrying this product. Work well for removing eye makeup, will purchase again.</li>
            <li> We love this product! My two-year-old son has moderate eczema especially on his elbows, ankles, and backs of his knees. Lately some of the other products we&#x27;ve used he says hurts him, however, this product actually soothes him and is the only thing he wants us to use! Good thing it works! Another plus is I don&#x27;t feel bad if I have to put it on him multiple times a day. :-)</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product- does all that petroleum jelly or Vaseline does but with no petroleum in it!&lt;br /&gt;( Read on the internet why petroleum jelly is not exactly a good thing)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can moisturize your face- you can clean your make up off with it. And no petrol smell!&lt;br /&gt;While adults use this in my house- it appears to be safe for babies( check latest labeling)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does not test on animals. A lot of the ingredients are ingredients you will feel safe putting on your face.&lt;br /&gt;Got their SPF 30 Lip Balm and that is a winner of a product as well. Stays on for hours- even if you put lipstick on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;In fact, keeps lipstick on very much like a lipstick primer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are browsing Amazon- I suggest trying both.  Or check out all the Alba Botanical products to see what suits your needs here on Amazon.  This will be a permanent staple in my home. Everyone who tries it loves the feel and agrees it so nice NOT to smell the petrol smell. It is basically odorless!</li>
            <li> I use this on my son and it has a slight peanut oil smell but it&#x27;s not greasy and absorbs well.  Much safer than vaseline!</li>
            <li> Bought this because I saw a makeup tutorial from Kandee Johnson.  She uses this on her face nightly.  It makes all the difference in my face.  I think it is keeping blemishes away - even though when you put it on, it makes you think that it is so oily that it will cause blemishes.  This isn&#x27;t true.  My face drinks it up, and my face is so smooth in the morning!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, works pretty much exactly the same as the petroleum jelly that I used to buy in the squeeze bottle, except that it seems a bit thicker when you first go to spread it. Also, it has a rather unusual smell, but that seems to fade shortly after application. A great natural product that does exactly what I needed it to!</li>
            <li> Fantastic all bearing the word Thanks very much</li>
            <li> This has the same texture as petroleum jelly, and I think it works nearly as well.  Not quite as moisturizing, but close. I use it on my face as a night moisturizer.  The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that it is fragrance free, which I have found does not mean it doesn&#x27;t have a scent, it means that it smells rather like chemicals, rather than perfume.  They are not alone in that, many fragrance free products are that way.  (I prefer scent).</li>
            <li> Better than the petroleum based product of my youth, Vaseline, I have used this product since the mid &#x27;90&#x27;s and love it. It forms a great barrier against the elements with beeswax, moisture rich coconut oil and soothing, protective vitamin E&lt;br /&gt;To protect and soothe not just lips but chapped cheeks and hands and any other body parts exposed to wind and sun. It&#x27;s also gentle around the delicate eye area (still be careful not to get IN the eye) but I do use it as an eye cream near the eye as it is quite emollient. it&#x27;s truly great all over the body to soothe skin so if you have any skin irritations, give this a try. It&#x27;s inexpensive and might just do the trick for you if you&#x27;re battling a dry skin situation that&#x27;s not responding to anything else. It&#x27;s plant based as well, all natural with no parabans, sulfates or artificial colors and 100% vegan,  so no crazy chemicals to worry about either!  Just nice, soothing relief! ~ See also my review for Now Foods EPO Massage Oil for another great dry skin remedy.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great if you have really dry skin.  I like to use it on my lips at night.  BUT it is greasy.</li>
            <li> Love having a safe alternative to vaseline!</li>
            <li> This product has the same consistency as petroleum jelly, but is substantially more hydrating and smoothing. I&#x27;ve been using it on my hands and lips and it does not feel greasy or oily. Additionally, I feel better knowing that I am making a more environmentally conscious choice by not using an oil byproduct.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Not greasy, works great as chap stick, and dries fast. I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> I feel so much better using a non-petroleum base product, especially for eye make up removal. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I can add anything that hasn&#x27;t been said before...anything you would have used Vaseline for, use this instead. It also has many other uses (see makeup artist Kandee Johnson&#x27;s tricks! She slathers it all over her face after using expensive creams to make sure they don&#x27;t rub off on her pillow!) It will also last FOREVER, considering that you only need to use the teeniest bit. The price is right, too!</li>
            <li> I try not to use petroleum-based products, especially on my toddler. I&#x27;ve been using this instead for a few years and I love it. Very similar consistency to Vaseline, perhaps a little more watery. I use it on my toddler&#x27;s tushie, as it makes a great barrier. I&#x27;ve also used it on my lips! Overall it&#x27;s one of my cant-live-without products.</li>
            <li> My holistic vet recommends this for hairballs because it does not contain petroleum jelly. Of course she doesn&#x27;t like it, but it works ;)</li>
            <li> Best multi-purpose gel (or jelly) I have ever used for dry hands and feet,&lt;br /&gt;for my face, for diaper rash, for dry spots on animals . . . .  All the ingredients, I&lt;br /&gt;can actually pronounce.  I should buy stock in this company.  KPM</li>
            <li> Been using this as a diaper cream - it seems to work well.  I will try it as a moisturizer when the weather gets cooler.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff! The scent though..Smells like peanutbutter which I personally hate but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> This stuff should replace your Vaseline TODAY.  Toss out the petroleum, even if it&#x27;s purified and all the contaminates removed, where do they put them?  For the earth, for your family, MAKE THE SWITCH.  It&#x27;s an equal exchange minus the toxic issues related to what was once essentially crude oil.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. It actually heals not just protect. We got 2 tubes and both of us use it alot and dropped the regular petroleum jelly in the trash</li>
            <li> I was SO excited to get this, unfortunately it was giant FAIL! So disappointing. I live in Michigan and this past winter has been really harsh on my skin..its dry and flaky. I thought I would give this a try since I didn&#x27;t really care for the residue my Aquaphor was leaving behind.. First off the smell...it legit smelled like something had incubated itself inside the tube and died a slow death. I could not get over the smell. It was just too offensive. Second of all it left this strange film on my hands..ughh! I can&#x27;t even! End of story.</li>
            <li> The size is perfect for the diaper bag, so this is our travel diaper cream. Works well although I noticed when we were away for the weekend and used it exclusively my baby started getting a bit of diaper rash, which he doesn&#x27;t normally.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I have been using it on my dry and cracked heels, and it has made such a difference.  Better than any other product I have tried to treat that particular problem.  I will definitely re-order when this tube runs low!</li>
            <li> The ingredients listed on the Amazon website are NOT the same as listed on the tube.&lt;br /&gt;Actual ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil&lt;br /&gt;Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil&lt;br /&gt;Beeswax,&lt;br /&gt;HYDROGENATED CASTOR OIL&lt;br /&gt;Tocopheryl Acetate&lt;br /&gt;Tocopherol</li>
            <li> The ingredients cause an allergic reaction for me.</li>
            <li> A great product. I have been looking for a non-petroleum product for some time. This one is effective, easy to rub in and not gooey. Definitely comparable to Vaseline but without the petro-chemicals.</li>
            <li> After deciding not to use petroleum jelly (Vaseline) anymore, I set out to find a good substitute. I quickly found out about Alba&#x27;s Un-Petroleum Jelly and decided to try it out. I must say I love this stuff! It is less greasy, has MUCH healthier ingredients, leaves your skin very soft and soaks in faster and better than traditional Vaseline. It does have a shorter shelf life than petroleum jelly but that is not a big deal to me. Being such a versatile product, I use it frequently for many things (lips, cuticles, hand moisturizer, etc.) and usually run out of it before its expiration date. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product! I highly recommend it for those of you who have children as it is a much &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; product than petroleum jelly and has many, many versatile uses.</li>
            <li> Works really well to protect my toddler&#x27;s eczema. It has softened her skin a bit which is saying a lot because her eczema is pretty severe. Although I love how nicely it works, it&#x27;s a pain to get it washed out of her clothes. I still use it on her multiple times a day, though!</li>
            <li> Great Product! Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> I discovered this product years ago.  I use it to remove eye make-up and it also works great to moisturize the dry areas under my eyes.  It really helps my hands when they get chapped and start to crack during the winter months.  It makes my skin feel soft and smooth and I use it instead of the stuff with petroleum.</li>
            <li> I used this for a homemade lip gloss. Worked great</li>
            <li> I got this to put on my cracked heels at night... but I haven&#x27;t really notice it helping them much. It feels gross (just like petroleum jelly...i should have known I hate that stuff). I&#x27;ll use it, but won&#x27;t repurchase it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. lip gloss, makeup remover, etc. and it is not petroleum which is so much better for you.</li>
            <li> This works better than vaseline and it&#x27;s much healthier for you than using petroleum products. Use it to moisturize skin and lips. Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. My nose bleeds all through the winter and ever since I found out that you can&#x27;t put any Vicks or Vaseline inside your nose I was miserable. I use this every day and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Once I read how many chemicals go in to producing commercial petroleum jelly, I knew I had to find a natural alternative. And thanks to one click of the mouse at Amazon.com, I did! I use this product as I used to use the old petro jelly....for dry skin, lips, and even to strengthen my eyelashes. But now I know I am not soaking up any chemicals, which is a relief. It&#x27;s great, and reasonably priced, too.</li>
            <li> I mix this with my lotion and body oil at night to put on my feet and keep them soft. I have never used it for anything else, but it works well for that purpose. It leaves skin a little greasy, but that doesn&#x27;t last long. It soaks in rather quickly.</li>
            <li> healthier version of jelly. works well, but i wish they gave more. the tube is so small for the price you pay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently on a quest to replace petroleum jelly. This was my first choice to try out since it was cheaper than the other alternatives. So far I really like it. It does exactly what petroleum jelly did for me which is what I was looking for. As for the consistency, to me it&#x27;s no different than petroleum jelly initially. I just started using it as a night eye cream, and it there is no residue in the morning. I love that it&#x27;s natural and that it works better than vaseline.</li>
            <li> My wife and I are always looking at ways to use the most natural products we can find on our little one. Un-Petroleum Jelly is a no-brainer for us.  A little dab at every diaper change as a moisture-barrier has kept diaper rash at bay, and we feel good because we know we&#x27;re using a high quality, natural product.</li>
            <li> I put this on my hands last night, and this morning they were so amazingly soft and smooth!  This product works just like petroleum jelly, but is an all-natural hand/foot cream that you can feel good about using.  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  You can use it for everything.  Put it on your dry, cracked feet and hands.  We used it after our son&#x27;s circumcision and I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else.  Love that it&#x27;s petroleum free!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product.  However I was very disappointed to find that it has hydrogenated caster oil in it.</li>
            <li> I like that this isn&#x27;t derived as a waste product from refining oil. However, I&#x27;m going to say that is has done close to nothing to keep my AA baby&#x27;s face from becoming dry. It works on his body but his face needs Aquaphor. Sorry.</li>
            <li> Great product. Love the ingredients list. I love that it is an awesome multi-use product and a great go-to for different needs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good stuff though.</li>
            <li> I bought this because a Youtuber recommended it and I think I like it.  When I tried it as an all-over-face night cream it made my skin break out (I have extremely sensitive skin that&#x27;s oily and prone to break outs).  Lately I&#x27;ve been using it as an under eye night mask and on my lips and I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ve seen any real changes.  That might be a good thing though.  I bought it to keep my skin moisturized and hopefully prevent wrinkles, so no changes might be just what I want!  I have no complaints when using it minimally, and it is very moisturizing as a lip cream!</li>
            <li> Love it because it is petro free! We use it every night as a diaper barrier for the little one. Consistency and texture is the same as traditional petroleum jelly, even the same stickiness!</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and was hoping this would really work quickly to soften the skin on my feet.  I live in Florida so sandals are a major part of my footwear wardrobe.  Perhaps when the weather is cooler and closed shoes are more in the mix, this will work more to ;my liking.</li>
            <li> This product is kind of sticky, but moisturizes well.</li>
            <li> Good texture, great to use. behaves like conventional petroleum jelly. Petro-chemical free, and also aloe vera/cactus free. Very good for people with those allergies or with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> We love this Un-Petroleum have been using it for a few years now and always keep a couple tubes on hand.</li>
            <li> I use this as a night time beauty regime, I put it over my moisturizer to seal it into my skin for the night. It&#x27;s a little tacky feeling but it really seals in moisture!</li>
            <li> Excellent alternative to Aquaphor and other petroleum based products. I think it works just as well. I use it for my babies dry face multiple times a day!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Petroleum-free, paraben-free and all natural - no synthetic fragrance or additives. Another great product from alba!</li>
            <li> This is a very good product that can be very hard to find.  Now, Amazon has made it easy as can be.  It is clear and easy to apply and works well to prevent diaper rash.</li>
            <li> I am a former Vaseline addict, and over the past year or two I have been slowly switching all of my products towards more natural products. Once I finished up yet another giant tub of vaseline, I knew it was probably time for me to get away from petroleum as well, so I decided to try this and see if it could compare with my beloved vaseline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that this product has no petrolatum, artificial colors/fragrances, parabens or phthalates and that they don&#x27;t test on animals. The first 3 ingredients are castor seed oil, coconut oil and beeswax. So the ingredients are awesome! It also works (for me, anyways) pretty much just like vaseline does. I get extremely dry hands in the winter time, and what I typically use this product for is to apply a light layer to my hands, lips, and the corners of my eyes (which get really dry also) right before bed to trap in the moisture from my other lotions/creams/balms, and it works great! It honestly looks and feels just like vaseline!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only have two complaints about this. First is the scent. It is not something I ever notice really unless I actually put the product up to my nose and smell it up close, but it has kind of an unappealing scent. I can&#x27;t put my finger on it, but it almost smells fake? Kind of plastic-y? Which is funny because this is an all natural product. But it really doesn&#x27;t bother me that much. The other thing is the tube it comes in. Just imagine pushing vaseline through a  tube like this. It isn&#x27;t exactly easy. And I am sure it will only get harder after more and more of the product gets used up. It is nice how you can be sure you use every little bit of vaseline up in it&#x27;s container, but this I&#x27;m sure would impossible to do that (unless you are cutting open the tube, at which point it becomes a bit unsanitary.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall though I really like this product. Like I said it performs JUST like vaseline does for me, so I love that! I am willing to pay a bit more and deal with the inconvenient tube though because I like the more natural ingredients. I was kind of expecting the worst with this product (skin reactions, etc.) and have been so pleasantly surprised to only have a positive experience, and I am really impressed! I highly recommend it!ient tube though because I like the more natural ingredients.

            <li> I get very dry hands that tend to crack and bleed, and I have been trying to find a non-petroleum based product for intense moisturizer at night. I tried this for at least 3 nights with cotton gloves and it actually seemed to make my hands worse somehow. I love Alba Botanica, but have no use for these now so I&#x27;m not happy with this purchase...</li>
            <li> Super hydrating, creamy, healing cream. Have purchased twice. Will buy again when we run out. Love, love this stuff. Very similar texture to vasaline in texture, smell and color, but better for your skin.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great product and alternative to traditional Petroleum Jelly.  Product arrived in good contition and packaged well.  I would by again!</li>
            <li> It is sticky and also smells very strange. Castor oil makes a major appearance in the odor composition, but there is another more peculiar note to it. Like burnt rubber or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***********UPDATE********************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a while now, almost finished it off. And I got to say--it works OK, not bad at all. The smell is still bad, but it does moisturize well</li>
            <li> Great all purpose jelly, great for makeup removal, etc. Will definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my face, neck, and chest post fraxel laser treatment.  My physician recommended several products (aquaphor, aveeno, neutrogena) but I will not buy products that test on animals so I used this instead.  Its a great product.  Kept my skin soft.  I healed up beautifully.</li>
            <li> I loved the product but found it pricey for the amount of packaging. I make lip balms and decided to use coconut oil and a small amount of bees wax instead. Works great.</li>
            <li> hard to rub and i end up mixing it with a more liquid lotion so i can rub it on my boys. great for winter time.</li>
            <li> safer than petroleum jelly</li>
            <li> Works great in lip balms!</li>
            <li> Quite a bit more expensive than plain old petroleum jelly, but works beautifully for all health and beauty applications where I used to use petroleum jelly products but wanted something more naturally-derived.  I really like the packaging too- it makes me smile.</li>
            <li> this is a wonderful product for those who do NOT want to use petroleum based products on their skin.  i use this as part of a recipe that i put together to treat my psoriasis.</li>
            <li> I love this Jelly. It works just like a regular vaseline.  The best part is that it is natural and safe. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is the way it should have been from the old days!</li>
            <li> Love this product. I wish it came in a bigger tube.</li>
            <li> great as an alternate to Vaseline</li>
            <li> This un-petroleum jelly is very moisturizing.  It has a creamy formula which glides on to your skin. It is safe and natural, too.</li>
            <li> While a good moisturizer, this product does not smell good.  I haven&#x27;t used it since the first time trying it.</li>
            <li> Works well. I was expecting a bit of coconut smell but it actually smells just like petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful substitute for petroleum jelly and I&#x27;ve bought truckloads of this stuff over the years. For medical reasons I have to use as many natural products as possible, and this does fit the bill. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I just started using this on my face at night (as per Tyra, but healthier), and when I wake up I seriously look flawless. My friends are asking me what crazy things I&#x27;m doing, and they don&#x27;t believe me when I tell them I slather unpetroleum jelly on my face before I go to bed. Good, because it makes me look even better in comparison. But anyway, I also like using it on my lips and the hydration this stuff is unbelievable. It lasts too!</li>
            <li> love the natural ingredients, and works well as a lip treatment overnight. Has a weird smell to it, but I think its from the castor oil.</li>
            <li> A little hard to move, works well with oil blended. Great on hands and feet, no smell &amp; non greasy,  I like this a lot. I&#x27;ll purchase again.</li>
            <li> I am still not totally convinced that Vaseline (petroleum jelly) is toxic for babies, but just in case, I put it away and switched to this product, which works just as well. It&#x27;s a touch thicker than Vaseline, so it doesn&#x27;t absorb as easily, but that also makes it better for using it as a diaper cream (makes a thicker barrier for overnight use). I also use it in place of baby lotion after the bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great deal for a super versatile product!</li>
            <li> A friend I used to work with got on my FB page after seeing the horrible trouble I was dealing with in the way of hives. I mean the kind of hives that make a person look beat up and swell eyes shut.  Now my friend has absolutely beautiful skin,no hives, no flaws, no wrinkles all that wonderful stuff the rest of us wish we could get.  Well she told me about this stuff and this was how she did it.  She was right!  It immediately controled the hives on my face and soothed the pain from the hives as they feel like a second degree sunburn instantly!&lt;br /&gt;Not only that I have found the Alba Un-Petrolum Jelly as a great use as a base for mixing with Essential Oils.  I highly recommend it.  Thank God for friends that care about each other or I would still be suffering.</li>
            <li> Pricey, but mimics the unnatural stuff well. My baby had some irritation when I started using it, which has cleared up. The tube has lasted longer than I expected.  Smell is odd, but very mild.</li>
            <li> In an effort to rid our home of mineral oil based products, I decided to give this product a try. It&#x27;s a wonderful, all-purpose product that you can feel good about using.</li>
            <li> Like it , but little difficult to squeeze from the tube. A great substitute for Vaseline. Good on all skin areas</li>
            <li> great diaper rash ointment - works great with my cloth diapers - no issues at all! i normally would use just plain coconut oil - but I cannot take that to daycare.  This ointment hasn&#x27;t ruined any cloth inserts and the daycare is able to use it.  win win!</li>
            <li> I use this on my eczema and it has nearly healed it without steroids. It is also a wonderful lip balm/gloss. I get compliments anytime I use it as a gloss. Keeps skin soft.</li>
            <li> Use this on my son every day, he hasn&#x27;t had diaper rash at all.</li>
            <li> too sticky for me.  not as moisturizing as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I have pretty finicky skin. If it doesn&#x27;t like something, it will definitely let me know with a vengeance. I was skeptical to use it as a moisturizer for my face because it is a really thick formula. But since it worked wonders on my rough chapped hands from work and the cold winter months, and it is made of natural ingredients that other facial products use anyway, I gave it a go. After applying it sparingly at night, I woke up to soft hydrated skin and no break-outs!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for several months now and have nothing but soft hydrated skin. It has been especially helpful when the seasons are changing to dryer colder months. I have been also using the Proactiv toner and treatment lotion along with the un-petroleum jelly and my skin has been happy so far. It also works wonders as a lip conditioner. It&#x27;s like a little miracle tube!&lt;br /&gt;Since it is a very thick formula, I would use this only as a night time face moisturizer because it can be a little sticky/shiny right after applying. It also has this \\&quot;earthy/natural\\&quot; smell (probably from the coconut oil or something) that is not strong, but you may still be able to smell it after several hours.&lt;br /&gt;Since you only need such a small amount, this tube will last a good while. Worth a try!</li>
            <li> Small quantity is really good to keep the skin dry and smooth. I use it on my face at night and in the morning i feel my face to be very smooth and moisturized!</li>
            <li> This is my go to product! I use it for my face, burns, rashes, dry spots, ect. We use this for everything and LOVE IT!!!</li>
