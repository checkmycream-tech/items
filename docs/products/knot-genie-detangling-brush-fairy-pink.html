            <li>This is amazing!</li>
            <li>I cannot fully express how amazing this brush is!</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>This brush is amazing!  </li>
            <li>Amazing !</li>
            <li>Very impressed and pleased.</li>
            <li>Great brush it is so loved by my granddaughter.</li>
            <li>She can now brush her hair on her own without ripping her hair out!</li>
            <li>and she loves brushing her own hair with it too!</li>
            <li>and she will even brush her own hair now!</li>
            <li>Once I found how it works best for us, separating and brushing in sections, it is so easy.</li>
            <li>Will continue searching for a good detangler brush for kids</li>
            <li>This does work fairly well.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly this works</li>
            <li>My kids loved those brushes.  </li>
            <li>This is generally a good brush.</li>
            <li>I ordered this and honestly did not expect great things.</li>
            <li>and i got to try it out and loved it</li>
            <li>a good conditioner after rinsing shampoo.</li>
            <li>but it does get rid of a good 90% of them.</li>
            <li>The size is good too.</li>
            <li>Ive also used it on my own hair in the shower as a shampoo brush and it gives a great scalp massage.</li>
            <li>We will just stick to using a good detangler and brush/comb.</li>
            <li>the price is good, even it is for kids, we can use it too.</li>
            <li>good for hair.</li>
            <li>My 3 year-old daughter has beautiful curly hair, but it meant many mornings combing out tons of knots.  </li>
            <li>Which is great for brushing her hair and even better when she plays with my hair and then brushes it.</li>
            <li>Worth the $$ for sure!!!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Kids love this brush!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>This thing is like magic!  </li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>So glad I bought this!</li>
            <li>I love this brush!</li>
            <li>We love this brush!</li>
            <li>So.. not it is laying around the house and we are using it on our cat, who seems to like it much better!</li>
            <li>Works great, easy to grip.</li>
            <li>This brush had a handle and claimed that it was great at not pulling hair and going through knots easily.</li>
            <li>This brush has made brushing my 3 yr olds hair a much more pleasant experience.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to hold and does a great job moving through her hair.  </li>
            <li>The knot genie now makes this event in our house much more pleasant.</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing...  </li>
            <li>This brush is amazing.</li>
            <li>It works, but was not as amazing as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>This brush had reviews that it was amazing.  </li>
            <li>This thing is amazing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just amazing</li>
            <li>Amazing at removing knots.  </li>
            <li>All in all the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing for toddlers.  </li>
            <li>Again, it performed amazingly...</li>
            <li>this brush is amazing.</li>
            <li>This brush feels cheap, didn&#x27;t do a great job on tangles and made my daughter&#x27;s hair frizzy.</li>
            <li>It is truly amazing.  </li>
            <li>I was suspect of all the rave reviews - but I must say, it is amazing.</li>
            <li>But it really works best if you used in combination with a leave in conditioner ...</li>
            <li>It also works nicely to distribute the oils in your hair to give it a nice shine</li>
            <li>but it depends on what kind of activity has endured before brushing.</li>
            <li>pro is that my daughter likes to hold it on her own and brush her own hair.&lt;br /&gt;The con of that</li>
            <li>so this is a nice solution that doesn&#x27;t involve drenching her hair in de-tangler or conditioner.</li>
            <li>But effective.</li>
            <li>Nice to have no complaints when brushing kids hair.</li>
            <li>Nice brush for baby girl&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li>she brushes her own hair too.</li>
            <li>it is nice</li>
            <li>I wish I had picked a more neutral color because her brother loves it and said it felt good, Before school the three kids get themselves dressed and groomed.</li>
            <li>I tried on my own hair and it couldn&#x27;t even brush through it.</li>
            <li>My kids have very knotty hair, and this has been wonderful for them.  </li>
            <li>and she is 5 and can brush her own hair with this brush.</li>
            <li>and I have my own system with how I must get through their hair.</li>
            <li>She loves brushing her own hair now which takes a lot of stress out of the morning.</li>
            <li>She will even brush her own hair, and my husband noted it&#x27;s miraculous ability to brush virtually painlessly.</li>
            <li>This is the miracle brush that every parent should own.</li>
            <li>The bristles just kind of go around them instead, basically ignoring them.  </li>
            <li>I bought each of them their own.</li>
            <li>Fits in my hand nicely, as well as hers.</li>
            <li>She also LOVES brushing her own hair now.</li>
            <li>My daughter likes to brush her own hair now</li>
            <li>Love love love this!!  </li>
            <li>I loved it so much I gave it as Christmas gifts to friends who have girls - they loved it!</li>
            <li>Its quick, easy, and my daughters hair looks great!  </li>
            <li>anymore this brush is worth the money!!!</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful well constructed invention, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Practice make perfect with this product, but so far, I am pleased with its results!</li>
            <li>no problems at all, holds well, soft touch bristles and one happy child, thank you works great</li>
            <li>This size is also perfect -- says its made for kid hands, but this fits my adult hand nicely  -</li>
            <li>The quick delivery and pricing were great.</li>
            <li>Our hairdresser recommended this to help with our daughter&#x27;s hair which tends to get knotted very easily even with conditioner and de-tangler.  </li>
            <li>the bristles bend very easily also.</li>
            <li>but this brush did not make it very easy</li>
            <li>Best buy so far!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s assessment, and those of many reviewers were not wrong - this is an amazing product!!  </li>
            <li>As for shipping, it was pretty good!  </li>
            <li>very smooth brushing, no tugging, and I will be using it on her hair and my own while travelling overseas.</li>
            <li>It is good for fine hair too.</li>
            <li>She is now able to brush her own hair without problems.</li>
            <li>Granddaughter with sensitive scalp is very happy!</li>
            <li>it the most amazing brush ever</li>
            <li>She brushes her own every day and there is never any more tears.  </li>
            <li>No matter how tangled her hair is, the Knot Genie goes right through without pulling and now her hair looks great all of the time.  </li>
            <li>Easy to comb snarls out!</li>
            <li>This brush makes combing through her hair so easy!</li>
            <li>/&gt;3.If hair is exceptionally frizzy,I use some  coconut oil to smooth hair out and unknot the tangles before showering,then shampoo it</li>
            <li>Okay, I thought - it requires the loving touch of mom to do well :).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle brush, but it&#x27;s pretty great and works for us.</li>
            <li>You know what they say:  if it sounds too good to be true...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and easy, plus her hair looks great.</li>
            <li>it is very cheap plastic feeling</li>
            <li>to the purchase of this item, everything went very smooth.</li>
            <li>up!!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;It does however work great for my daughter that has super fine hair.</li>
            <li>It works good to get out tangles quickly</li>
            <li>I will admit that I didn&#x27;t quite use it as directed at first, and it did result in her backing away from it suspiciously, but when she tried it herself and got used to holding it the right way, it worked great!  </li>
            <li>A huge plus!</li>
            <li>Also it doesn&#x27;t catch the hair as well, and so we need more strokes to brush out the tangles.</li>
            <li>I am sure many of you riding these reviews are hoping in vain for a magic brush to ease the struggle as I was.</li>
            <li>She wont let me brush it more after she is &amp;#34;done&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>It does get the tangles out of the top layer if that is all you want.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this brush.</li>
            <li>We tried a lot of combs and this one has worked better than the others.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe more people haven&#x27;t told me about this miracle product.</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t call it a &amp;#34;genie&amp;#34;  maybe just the name to make kids feel better about their hair being ripped out?</li>
            <li>It is fantastic for knots!</li>
            <li>and I sometimes think the brush adds to frizziness but I am not 100 percent sure.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the product.  </li>
            <li>I would have like to have been a better made product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to run the Knot Genie in her hair without the tears that often show up with brushing.</li>
            <li>Comes in variety of cute colors and patterns.</li>
            <li>It really works great</li>
            <li>Definitely a worthwhile purchase.</li>
            <li>I to keep one here for when my grand daughters visit, and one for each my grand daughters to have at their houses.</li>
            <li>I have also recommended purchasing one to my friends to have on hand for their grand daughters.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>and now she loves brushing her hair because it doesn&#x27;t hurt and I love it because it get tangles out with no complaints.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>She gets so many tangles</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very happy with this brush.</li>
            <li>Why would you make a fantastic brush that comes apart?!?</li>
            <li>But it does it&#x27;s job getting the knots out without a screaming fit!</li>
            <li>I still LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s been better than the alternative.</li>
            <li>There are way better brushes out there.  </li>
            <li>She still won&#x27;t always let me brush her hair, but it&#x27;s so much better since I got this.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure when buying</li>
            <li>The tapered and flexible pins do not snag the hair like most brushes do.  </li>
            <li>She now uses this brush herself and gets amazingly tangle free hair.</li>
            <li>Loved it so much, I had to go and get my own.</li>
            <li>Love this brush for our daughter who hates to brush her hair.  </li>
            <li>and i love it</li>
            <li>Maybe I was expecting miracles, but this thing is just ok.</li>
            <li>and though I wanted to rave about it, I think it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li>I ended up purchasing another brush that worked much better.</li>
            <li>so glad this product is out there for all who have hair problems</li>
            <li>I was hoping this was going to be the magical answer</li>
            <li>so well my grand daughter who used to cry and fuss as her mom tried to comb out her hair tangles now turns to her mother and says &amp;#34;That&#x27;s it?</li>
            <li>My grand daughter had this so caught up in her hair</li>
            <li>My wife uses this brush for our daughter&#x27;s hair every morning, they absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>My kids scream more with this brush then the one I had used before.</li>
            <li>My daughter still doesn&#x27;t like having her hair combed, but this has made it much better</li>
            <li>and she was asking every day if the \\&quot;magic brush\\&quot; was here.</li>
            <li>But, ok, working with what we have, we tried it.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off using a rounded brush.</li>
            <li>This gets the knots out pain free!</li>
            <li>There is nothing magical about the knot genie brush.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve NEVER been able to comb/brush through ALL of her hair.  </li>
            <li>it is just a brush.  :)</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Works much better then a comb or brush.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work....</li>
            <li>Strangers love to touch her hair all the time.</li>
            <li>But MOSt detanglers work for that type of hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d think it was more of a $4 item</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>-- but any brush works okay then.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>what makes this brush work so much better, but it is a life saver.  </li>
            <li>she co-operates so much better.</li>
            <li>We love this brush.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t made with magic or pixie dust, but it&#x27;s simple design is perfect for my hair as well as my daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>but I was able to get it cheaper on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>We still use detangler (I&#x27;ve got some Avon stuff she likes) to give us an edge, but this works much better than the comb or brush we were using before.</li>
            <li>this brush is fabulous!</li>
            <li>/&gt;NO more harmful chemical detangler sprays ,which never worked by the way.</li>
            <li>/&gt;NO more harmful chemical detangler sprays ,which never worked by the way.</li>
            <li>This brush makes it much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure hair type might be a factor here.  </li>
            <li>will say that I gave it to my daughter for Christmas from Santa, and that the hype of that alone got her attention because I told her it was probably magic.  </li>
            <li>We have tried many brushes and detanglers.  </li>
            <li>I wish I had shopped around more.</li>
            <li>This brush plus water is definitely the best combination we&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>She let&#x27;s me brush her hair again :)</li>
            <li>And it is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I found this brush at a hair salon and bought 2 more online just so we could always find one.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>w/Aussie leave in conditiioner:-)</li>
            <li>Its not painless, but it is definitely better then using a comb.  </li>
            <li>I was very excited about the idea of purchasing this product.  </li>
            <li>I have always had very fine hair, which tangles easily.  </li>
            <li>This has made it so much easier to keep her hair looking nice!</li>
            <li>This brush is AMAZING at quickly getting through the tangles ...</li>
            <li>I ususally do not write many reviews, but feel so strongly against this product after trying it that I was compelled to do so.</li>
            <li>It detangles the top layer of hair, yet after a week of use I noticed a rats nest under the top smooth hair on my daughters head.  </li>
            <li>Works like magic on my girl&#x27;s fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush for my daughter&#x27;s super curly hair!</li>
            <li>When I used it to blow dry my hair, I was impressed at how easy it was to use since it had the handle.</li>
            <li>To my surprise, the brush went right through her hair with no pulling, and even better no screaming!</li>
            <li>The Knot Genie did a very good job of getting through her hair without pulling and yanking as much as a regular comb or brush.  </li>
            <li>This was a gift from my very sweet husband.</li>
            <li>Found a brush called the wet brush that works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>Since I have fine hair, it does tend to get staticky more easily, but then again it&#x27;s also winter which doesn&#x27;t help.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an ok brush, but doesn&#x27;t detangle as pain free as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>However, I find this brush works best if the hair is wet.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to give this 5 stars since the product was so good</li>
            <li>Bought 2 gave one to a friend I loved so much.....</li>
            <li>The smaller size of this one works great when my daughter wants to comb her own hair- and mine!</li>
            <li>My oldest was so excited to get this brush and has tried to use it over and over but ends up in tears more when she uses it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t even bother with the knot genie, go get a brush that detangles hair and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews I had hoped that the tears would be gone and bathtime would be easy.  </li>
            <li>making the process of removing tangles easy or painless.</li>
            <li>After bath time it was easy as well.  </li>
            <li>Everyone had such great reviews of this brush so I was hoping to love it.</li>
            <li>It easily gets tangled.  </li>
            <li>The knots are easily removed with out a struggle.  </li>
            <li>Fits in their hands easily.</li>
            <li>Easy for Mom to use and</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy for her to use.</li>
            <li>Both my hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair tangle easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t slip out of her hand easily.</li>
            <li>I can now easily brush her hair and it does not hurt her at all.  </li>
            <li>So it helps very much, but I still need the detangling spray for both of them, whichever kind of brush I use.  </li>
            <li>WOW, this brush is amazing!</li>
            <li>This brush is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>My daughter has shoulder length fine hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li>My daughter is 3 and has beautiful curly blonde hair</li>
            <li>Her hair tends to have a dullest quality to it, and this brush not only worked out the tangles, but made her hair look so shiny and beautiful.  </li>
            <li>Would not brush through the hair and leaves it full of static.</li>
            <li>, I open the Knot Genie, start at my scalp, and the brush easily glides all the way to the end of my hair with nary a snag!!!</li>
            <li>you need a brush, go for it, this one is fine.</li>
            <li>I use it myself from time to time and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>, the product seems to be fine and it arrived on or before the day it was promised.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I have fine, curly hair.</li>
            <li>My daughter has fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend unless you have shorter, fine hair to use it on.</li>
            <li>Even though my hair is fine, I have a lot of it.  </li>
            <li>No more screaming and pulling and tugging,no more threatens to cut hair length,and best of all,she can sometimes do it herself.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>my granddaughter&#x27;s hairy is fine</li>
            <li>This hairbrush works fine, i guess?</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really understand the mechanics of why it works better, it just does!</li>
            <li>I have tightly coiled hair and this works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Hair brushing, washing, anything - is a huge fight with my kids.  </li>
            <li>It was alright, but didn&#x27;t make a huge difference.</li>
            <li>It gently eases tangles out tear free, and can be a valuable training tool to teaching your child to brush his/her own hair.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s pain free</li>
            <li>Who has to hide in the basement, the garage, or the den for an hour with the light off after making his daughter cry?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was&#x27;t sure that almost $10 was worth paying for a brush.</li>
            <li>All I can say is, believe those great reviews - it actually works!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great brush for younger kids with lots of tangles</li>
            <li>Every morning is a screaming fit about brushing hair.  </li>
            <li>Once you get a section completely free braid it so it doesn&#x27;t tangle.</li>
            <li>My hair is smooth and feels healthier.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable to hold in my hand and just glides through her</li>
            <li>thing is a cheap pieces of junk.</li>
            <li>They had it available for purchase</li>
            <li>we get all untangled and silky smooth by then.&lt;br /&gt;8.For</li>
            <li>It works, but not hurt free.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the sound it makes as I&#x27;m brushing her hair with it.  </li>
            <li>month later, she HAPPILY brushes her hair, (which in itself, is a miracle.)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a FANTASTIC investment for ANY child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, but not cheaply-made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And the SOUND of trying to get through the knots was so troubling</li>
            <li>It was like the sound of brushing my dog&#x27;s (a goldendoodle) hair.  </li>
            <li>I bought one of these not expecting much, but it is amazing.  </li>
            <li>She has beautiful long hair.</li>
            <li>but with this so far so good, it helps with the knots and helps with all the complaining.</li>
            <li>and so far so good.</li>
            <li>She can finally brush though her own hair on her own.</li>
            <li>love this comb works so well on my daughter super long hair and is great for tangles</li>
            <li>But, I am happy to say the positive reviews are right on, it really, REALLY helps get their hair smoothed out and looking great with little or no fuss, great product, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>My 3-year-old daughter&#x27;s fine hair would get so many tangles in it, and I&#x27;d make a funny story about the rat&#x27;s having a party in her hair while she slept to keep her distracted while I worked and worked to get the snarls out.  </li>
            <li>I use a comb and normal brush when she&#x27;s not looking that does a better job!  </li>
            <li>We can get her hair done so quickly and easily with this comb.</li>
            <li>When my daughter gets a bit older and combs her own hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;We are sure to spray a detangler first because without that it wouuldn&#x27;t work quite as smoothly.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has had very unruly hair from birth that would tangle and get knots very easily.</li>
            <li>I use this on my daughter&#x27;s hair straight out of the bath, and it glides through her hair very easily, from scalp to ends.</li>
            <li>She has very very curly/knotty/nappy hair :)</li>
            <li>Thus came quickly, the works great with my daughters long thing easily tangled hair....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m considering getting the larger model for my own hair!</li>
            <li>Both girls dislike it in general, and we have nothing good to say about it</li>
            <li>She actually even brushes her own hair!  </li>
            <li>it was worth every penny!</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the expense!</li>
            <li>When it arrived both my daughter and I were excited to try it out and to our surprise</li>
            <li>I was really excited about this brush after reading about it in a magazine and reading the reviews here.</li>
            <li>Also, she has super fine wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>She was so excited when this came in the mail.</li>
            <li>Worth it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great at brushing her long, tangled hair and doesn&#x27;t seem to hurt.</li>
            <li>I gave it 2 stars rather than 1 because it is cute, therefore somewhat more appealing to a toddler than a regular brush.is cute, therefore somewhat more appealing to a toddler than a regular brush.</li>
            <li>pretty sure there are no fairies inside the brush,</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and was excited to try this brush.</li>
            <li>Very nice and painless detangling (and break-free), even on dry (though lightly moisterized) hair.</li>
            <li>My daughter found it fun and easy to use.</li>
            <li>my 6 year old can&#x27;t fit her hand around it to comb her own hair.</li>
            <li>Sure enough we bought out own and she brushes her hair or lets me do it everynight without complaining.</li>
            <li>To be fair, it&#x27;s my fault for believing that a brush could have some magical quality to it, but after reading the glowing reviews, I honestly expected some technological advance to exist in this brush that helped detangle hair.</li>
            <li>The original size fills my large hand so the Teeny Genie size might be a better choice for the Small Handed in addition to being the perfect size for young daughters brushing their own hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>Not the best brush on my super thick haired girl, but luckily she has a tougher head, too!</li>
            <li>I bought this brush for my 6 year old granddaughter, who has very fine, easily tangled hair.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.  </li>
            <li>I have yet found a way that this is anything special.</li>
            <li>Just went right through the knots in one stroke!</li>
            <li>My 6 y.o. daughter has long, very fine hair that tangles very easy and</li>
            <li>It is great for wet detangling hair.</li>
            <li>this brush works great on their wet hair.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve also found that if I apply some Argan Nut Oil on my daughter&#x27;s wet hair before brushing, the result is great as the oil helps strengthen the hair and makes for easier brushing.</li>
            <li>daughter has straight hair that doesn&#x27;t have many tangles,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>She love it and wants another one to keep in our camper.</li>
            <li>Worked reasonably well and better than combing alone.</li>
            <li>I use it for my daughter&#x27;s hair which is really curly, this brush help with combing and defining her curls evern more.</li>
            <li>Thanks:)</li>
            <li>Their hair is also different lengths and types but the knot genie is loved by all of them.</li>
            <li>What I love about this detangling brush is that it makes getting the tangles out a much faster process.</li>
            <li>so I know what a fair comparison is to a regular brush.  </li>
            <li>This one is NOT pain-free but it is VERY pain-minimal and she has the most tangle-prone hair of any kid I&#x27;ve ever met.  </li>
            <li>My daughter loves this brush so much I&#x27;ve bought two more - one for use in school and another for when she goes swimming.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not nearly as bad.</li>
            <li>The brush cleans up very easily and looks like new still.  </li>
            <li>I think it is great, but I do not not notice a HUGE difference in less pain.</li>
            <li>It worked great on wet hair too!  </li>
            <li>THIS IS A MUST purchase, MUST MUST MUST, your daughter will love brusing her own hair and you will love no more tears</li>
            <li>Super Cheaply made or price paid, but works ok so far.</li>
            <li>I thought first that it was just me, or my girl has super tangled hair, but two of my friends borrowed it from me and it didn&#x27;t work for any of them (at all!)</li>
            <li>She prefers it so much more than a regular brush, and I am glad to no longer hear her whine or cry every time I brush her hair.</li>
            <li>Brushing my daughter&#x27;s hair is now a quick and painless process.</li>
            <li>However the reason I bought this particular \\&quot;0.13  ounce Fairy Pink\\&quot; Knot Genie brush was because I thought it was the teeny genie, so that my girls could eventually brush their own hair and the brush would fit better into their smaller hands...</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s super quick and doesn&#x27;t hurt one bit.</li>
            <li>This does the trick painlessly and quickly.</li>
            <li>, it gets the job done so quickly.  </li>
            <li>My girls do not want me using any other brush, they love this thing!!</li>
            <li>It does work slightly better than a normal brush</li>
            <li>It is nice for her scalp but doesn&#x27;t work any better than other brushes at trying to get her to let me brush her hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this brush because hair brushing was becoming a real battle.  </li>
            <li>First, the quality of this brush just seems really, really, cheap.  </li>
            <li>Bought for my three-year-old daughter&#x27;s very fine soft hair.</li>
            <li>My 4 year old daughter has very fine, curly hair.  </li>
            <li>My 6 year old daughter has baby fine hair that knots easily.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m happy because less drama.</li>
            <li>Makes the mornings soooo much easier :) I would suggest for curly or straight hair!</li>
            <li>It gets tangled easily because I wear it up so much.  </li>
            <li>No matter how adorable Sesame Street detangler might be, nobody wants their hair doused with so much detangler that it looks like she didn&#x27;t even wash her hair!</li>
            <li>Brushing is so much faster with the Knot Genie!!</li>
            <li>I straightened my hair for the first times in months!</li>
            <li>It is a must have that I wish I would have discovered much sooner!!</li>
            <li>Highly reccomend it!!!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was hoping for. 5 stars!</li>
            <li>My daughters do not have super thick or really knotty hair, so I don&#x27;t know how it works on that type of hair, but for their hair, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>This was by far the most gentle and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I bough a real one brush, with fine bristles for $4 at the nearby *</li>
            <li>daughter has the type of hair that always seems to look tangled and unbrushed 5 minutes after a thorough brushing, even with good conditioner (long, strong hair but not thick).  </li>
            <li>My daughter has very curly fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I think this brush may work on a lot of types of hair, but fine and straight is not one of them.</li>
            <li>Great for our little girl&#x27;s knotty hair.</li>
            <li>Great of wet hair!!!</li>
            <li>they are all light plastic and don&#x27;t really do much.</li>
            <li>but I think it was well worth the $$.</li>
            <li>this brush is 100% worth the money.</li>
            <li>My daughter has thick straight hair, while my friend&#x27;s daughter has thinner curlier hair - it worked great for both girls!</li>
            <li>It was worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Grand daughter 4 crys while you do her hair no matter how her hair is extremely sensitive</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve bought many brushes for our childs sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>Soft and gentle, and effective on both cat and dog...</li>
            <li>This brush seemed like the answer to our prayers - not only would it detangle but no tears, no screaming and she could brush her own hair.  </li>
            <li>but they must have figured out it wasn&#x27;t fun that way</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the $10 or so.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still holding up for us, but then we rarely use this brush.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the $$</li>
            <li>Other than that I love this brush and so does my hair :)</li>
            <li>My daughter was excited to be able to have her hair brushed without my help or having it hurt.  </li>
            <li>She was excited about the color, size, and name of this brush when it arrived in the mail- especially after I assured her it would make the brushing experience much more tolerable.  </li>
            <li>I learned the cream rinse trick from a good friend that has a grandchild with that black nappy super fine\curly hair.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my 3 year old whose hair tangles super easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small enough to fit in her hand and the comb works great!</li>
            <li>went right thru it.  </li>
            <li>She would do it but not the right way.</li>
            <li>, I came home and ordered this right away.</li>
            <li>It glides right through the hair.  </li>
            <li>I can hear it going through the tangles, but it brushes right through without hurting her.  </li>
            <li>And they&#x27;re right.</li>
            <li>Purchased it as an add on so the price was right.</li>
            <li>Yeah right, you&#x27;re probable thinking - you don&#x27;t know MY kid&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>I did not have to use detangler spray, it glided right through her hair</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s way right through.</li>
            <li>Maybe I wasn&#x27;t using it right</li>
            <li>I used it in the morning, and with 5 quick strokes her entire head was tangle free and so smooth.  </li>
            <li>This worked great on my 3 year old granddaughter&#x27;s curly, long hair.  </li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t perfect as far as no knots but a lot better than a standard brush and works well on my 5 year old&#x27;s long wavy hair.</li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t hurt as much because it only brushes the top layer of hair!  </li>
            <li>We had ordered the Teeny Genie and got this, which is a behemoth-sized palm fit, so the Littles can&#x27;t hold it very well, and it&#x27;s even large for my hand.  </li>
            <li>She first tried it right after school yesterday.</li>
            <li>So easy to brush my 2 year old granddaughters hair</li>
            <li>Works great on wet hair helping my 7 year old comb her hair and avoid knots.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend for everyone who has hair that tangles easily, or who have sensitive scalps.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy for a child or adult to hold and use.</li>
            <li>Huge bonus that it&#x27;s pink because that is her favorite color.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much, I bought a second one - one for upstairs, one for downstairs.  </li>
            <li>No more tears at bath time any more!!  </li>
            <li>This brush is fantastic for one of my grand nieces who has very fine thin hair.  </li>
            <li>My granddaughters are always complaining when I want to brush their hair but this brush is great!&lt;br /&gt;It gets the tangles out very gently.</li>
            <li>Most brushes hurt and make my hair frizzier, this does not hurt, is easy to use and cuts down on the frizz too.</li>
            <li>This really works!  </li>
            <li>She says that she likes it better than her regular brush</li>
            <li>While this does better than a regular brush if they have ANY sort of curl or thickness to their hair</li>
            <li>However, there are some things most fathers simply do not know,...</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say its a &amp;#34;magical&amp;#34; brush like they imply, but it does work a lot better than any standard girls hairbrush.</li>
            <li>My first grade child always complains when I try to brush her hair.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find it to work any better than a regular brush &amp; I returned it.</li>
            <li>So much easier mornings!</li>
            <li>Better than a regular brush</li>
            <li>and I both love it, and my niece who is 8, no longer cries when her hip length hair gets brushed after a shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Knot Genie when it first came out.  </li>
            <li>but it works so well that I am willing to put up with the inconvenience.  </li>
            <li>Got this for my grand daughter who hates her hair brushed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a fantastic brush!</li>
            <li>This brush does exactly what it promises.</li>
            <li>She used to scream when we brushed her hair, but with this brush, she never complains and it has made bathtime in our house much more relaxed.</li>
            <li>Sadly, no.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better than a traditional brush</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>One stroke brushes the top, middle and bottom of hair.</li>
            <li>The Knot Genie was exactly what is shown in the image and works as said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now she is willing to let even daddy brush her hair.</li>
            <li>works pretty well.</li>
            <li>This is the first product I&#x27;ve been able to use on my middle child&#x27;s hair that allows me to comb from root to tip.  </li>
            <li>however it&#x27;s better than a standard brush.</li>
            <li>it does work better than a standard brush though.</li>
            <li>My daughter is 12 and for 11 years we have fought over brushing her curly hair (uh, she was bald for the first year).</li>
            <li>Truth be told, I occasionally use it for my beard as well :)</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s what I bought it for &amp; that&#x27;s exactly what it does.</li>
            <li>But what do you know, it works exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Be aware, this is a junk brush.</li>
            <li>The knot genie only detangled the top layer of hair, leaving a rats nest beneath.  </li>
            <li>The first one  lasted me for about a year.</li>
            <li>I personally didn&#x27;t think it did any better at getting knots out without pain.</li>
            <li>I ended up not being able to use it on my child&#x27;s hair because it&#x27;s curly and just made her hair one big pouf</li>
            <li>Would definitly recommend for straight hair!</li>
            <li>A regular brush and a wider tooth comb would have been a better investment for us.</li>
            <li>It really, really works!</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think it would be any better cut short.</li>
            <li>This is the only brush that works on my daughter&#x27;s super fine tangled hair.</li>
            <li>First of all we ordered this one thinking</li>
            <li>With the knot genie, we are able to brush her hair almost daily (sometimes even twice a day!).</li>
            <li>I bought this brush some time ago in the hopes that it would brush through my 5 year old daughter&#x27;s hair smoothly.  </li>
            <li>So well in fact, that her first one disappeared to someone else&#x27;s home.</li>
            <li>This brush really does work!</li>
            <li>When they tried it, they both said it took the knots out better than a regular brush, but it still hurt when they used it.</li>
            <li>I feel a regular detangling brush from Target worked better.</li>
            <li>If your child runs screaming every time you take a brush out, this is exactly what you need.</li>
            <li>When it first arrives, have patience with it and your child.</li>
            <li>Kids willingly use it.  </li>
            <li>I got this brush for my daughter for Christmas and she likes it much better than traditional brushes!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did not buy te bigger one.</li>
            <li>I saw this product, for the first time, in Parents Magazine.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not the first time this has happened</li>
            <li>and it works much better than any regular brush I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>color is pretty</li>
            <li>I brush my children&#x27;s hair with this first to get most of the knots out then the regular brush to finish up.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting several more so that we can have them with us all the time.  </li>
            <li>When I used this the first time in her hair, the brush got stuck within the knot</li>
            <li>My granddaughter has long very fine hair that snarls and tangles in the slightest breeze.  </li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair is long and very fine, with layers.  </li>
            <li>My 10 year old also like to use it on her hair (much thicker but still easily tangled during sleep), when she can pry it away from her sister.</li>
            <li>My daughter hates having her hair brushed she has a very sensitive scalp and this brush is amazing</li>
            <li>It also can scratch the scalp easily if you are not careful.</li>
            <li>She only wants to use this brush since she thinks it&#x27;s magic, but the regular brush worked better.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this for my 5-1/2 yr old girl after having read the reviews.</li>
            <li>About a month ago, hair brushing started becoming a challenge because of the tangles, even when we used a detangler and brushed very gently.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use,I only wish they had a kettle bell type handle or a long handle on it for easy holding.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use,I only wish they had a kettle bell type handle or a long handle on it for easy holding.</li>
            <li>You can still store clips and bobby pins inside, which is super helpful, but they made the bristles more rigid and almost sharp than before.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has really long, fine hair &amp; a lot of it!  </li>
            <li>However, because my hair is curly, I would not use this brush regularly as ANY brush causes my hair to frizz more (even though I dry it with a bonnet type of dryer and leave in most of the conditioner).  </li>
            <li>Finally, this product is built from what appears to be 10 cents worth of cheap plastic.  </li>
            <li>You still have to be gentle with it, but it is better than a traditional brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s okay simply because my daughter didn&#x27;t fight me as much when I used this brush.  </li>
            <li>She claims it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much and will sometimes look back to make sure this is the brush</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really remove knots any better than a regular comb would do for us.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has very fine, long, straight hair.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has thicker, but very straight hair that gets really tangled.  </li>
            <li>My young daughter has fine, long hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li>Both my grand nieces have long hair.</li>
            <li>MORE TEARS brushing her long hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Also, for you curly girls, we pair this with AG Fast Food leave-in hair conditioner and it helps keep those knots from forming in the first place.</li>
            <li>This is the first real brush I have used on her hair</li>
            <li>It was pretty much life-changing.  </li>
            <li>We were looking for something to brush my daughters long hair and this isn&#x27;t any better than the brushes we already had.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s slightly better in terms of hair pulling, however, the bristles on this hairbrush are very short, so maybe it doesn&#x27;t pull as much b/c it&#x27;s not brushing through as much?  </li>
            <li>My young daughter has had to have her hair cut short as it gets tangled very easily.</li>
            <li>while this brush doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as a regular hair brush on first &amp;#34;swipe&amp;#34;, it also doesn&#x27;t really get out the knots as easily either.  </li>
            <li>My 5 yr old has the most beautiful THICK LONG CURLY hair.</li>
            <li>Due to this, she gets tangles very easily.  </li>
            <li>and then when I got it the bristles seemed very short and easy to break</li>
            <li>My daughters have relatively straight hair, one with somewhat coarse hair and another with pretty fine hair.</li>
            <li>It comes apart in two pieces, but even my daughter can get it back together again easily.</li>
            <li>Have not used anyother brush on my 8yr old with Ld &amp; SENSORY.&lt;br /&gt;THE SUPER BRUSH---</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re flexible, so I thought there was no way they would be strong enough to work through her hair.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s large brushing surface area.</li>
            <li>It still hurts my daughter to brush out the large tangles, but it works well otherwise.</li>
            <li>The brush is too large for a child to hold as well.</li>
            <li>Prior to discovering the Knot Genie, my daughter would burst into tears every time I brushed her hair because her hair is extremely fine and gets easily tangled.</li>
            <li>Works great on wet hair but does tend to break dry hair.</li>
            <li>I only use it on the bottom parts of her hair, which is fine because that&#x27;s where all the tangles are anyway.</li>
            <li>She has baby fine hair with a medium curl that tangles on the back of her head, where her head touches the bed when she sleeps.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks now and let me tell you, my daughter is quick to tell you no other brush is going to touch her hair!  </li>
            <li>one straight, one finer and wavy).  </li>
            <li>This brush really delivers.</li>
            <li>I would really like to know who all these people touting its miracle powers are...</li>
            <li>I have found that I do need to be gentle or the teeth can hurt my daughter&#x27;s head.  </li>
            <li>but it works really well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a very therapeutic brush.</li>
            <li>My 4 year wants hair like Rapunzel and it gets in knots.  </li>
            <li>No tangling; glides straight through.</li>
            <li>then after a couple days not so much...</li>
            <li>, it won&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>I have straight hair and this brush worked wonders.</li>
            <li>but WE know who it was REALLY created for.  </li>
            <li>my youngest daughter has very curly hair, and it is always a battle to get her to let me even attempt to comb it.  </li>
            <li>She LOVES it ( she is 7 now) and covets the thing so much</li>
            <li>-(&lt;br /&gt;She says it pulls her hair too much and hurts.</li>
            <li>The brush is very flimsy and doesn&#x27;t work as advertised.</li>
            <li>Very useful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle.  </li>
            <li>and this really helps.</li>
            <li>It is fast and gets the knots out without hurting her.</li>
            <li>This product was highly recommended by a patient and a pharmaceuticals rep at my workplace, when I had expressed my issue about my daughter&#x27;s hair being so curly and unruly!</li>
            <li>It really does get through the tangles easier than a brush with nobs and hooks at the ends.</li>
            <li>My daughter never fights me when I use this brush and she even wants to herself now</li>
            <li>I expected something that would work better than a brush.</li>
            <li>Love the Fairy Pink detangling brush.  </li>
            <li>Forget about brushing through wet hair, it won&#x27;t, tried it after bath time thinking maybe that was when we would see the magic happen.</li>
            <li>The detangling process is very time consuming and accompanied by tears and screaming.  </li>
            <li>Give it a try if you dread hair combing as much as I used to.</li>
            <li>My daughter really dislikes this brush.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really work that well my hair or my daughter&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really compare.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair that wants to form ringlets and twists all the time and can get all tangled up.</li>
            <li>I tried this because my daughter (and myself) have curly and very tangled hair.  </li>
            <li>We didn&#x27;t really care if it took out tangles, as it hurt our heads too much to use anyway.  </li>
            <li>But all in all the brush really helps.</li>
            <li>My daughter doesn&#x27;t complain as much when I brush out the tangles with it either.</li>
            <li>My daughter (10 months) has very curly hair that gets very matted after sleeping on it and washing it.</li>
            <li>The know genie works without detangling spray, takes 3-4 minutes to do her whole head, and makes her hair much smoother.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has very think curly hair and brushing is a struggle.</li>
            <li>and I was hoping this brush would make getting tangles out much easier.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This thing really works.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li>You just have to be patient and keep gently brushing the hair, eventually the knots all work out.</li>
            <li>Her hair is straight, about medium thickness and the length of her shoulder blades.</li>
            <li>Maybe I was expecting too much from it, but I doubt I&#x27;d recommend it to friends or family from my experience.</li>
            <li>really fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s hair gets very tangled, and was a struggle every morning to brush it out.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Wet Brush after purchasing this one and it works so much better.</li>
            <li>Knot Genie gently detangles without pulling.  </li>
            <li>They come out eventually, but with a lot of distraction and gentle work.</li>
            <li>This brush really does get the tangles out without pulling hair.  </li>
            <li>You still have to be gentle, and work through the knots, but it doesn&#x27;t yank and hurt the scalp.</li>
            <li>My hair feels and looks so much softer now.</li>
            <li>There is still some annoyance with tangles, but a couple of swipes through the hair and they are gone - much quicker than the comb or brush.</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves using this brush.</li>
            <li>My daughter is very tender headed and has always fought me brushing her hair.  </li>
            <li>Was really looking forward  to something that could handle my daughter&#x27;s waist length hair.</li>
            <li>As a dad trying to help her get ready in the morning</li>
            <li>She used to CRY every time I tried to brush or comb it because it hurt so much.  </li>
            <li>but it really needs a handle.</li>
            <li>My daughter absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>It is not perfect, but it by far the best item on the market for brushing children&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>The unexpected side benefit is that the brush does such a good job that my kids&#x27; blonde hair looks even blonder.</li>
            <li>good old fashioned comb works way better than this expensive thing.</li>
            <li>My 2 1/2 year old daughter has long, very fine hair which is always tangled.</li>
            <li>My 3-year old has very fine, long hair.  </li>
            <li>Very good, after washing hair or wet hair when using this comb, hair loss, decreased significantly.</li>
            <li>It literally glides right through her hair with complete ease.</li>
            <li>Not as great as i expected based on other&#x27;s feedback</li>
            <li>on wet hair, it did a better job, but only if I added detangler spray to it and to be honest, a normal brush would have done the same job then</li>
            <li>She has long fine straight hair</li>
            <li>One of the best brushes I have found that works with my long, thin, straight hair that gets tangled.</li>
            <li>However it&#x27;s much better than the other brushes we were using.</li>
            <li>Other than that, we love it.</li>
            <li>It also creates static due to the plastic bristles.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work any better than any other brush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>So, if that scene sounds at all familiar to you, you should totally try this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works so much better than any other comb or brush I have tried.  </li>
            <li>oh well, now I&#x27;ve got an extra one for me to use until the original one shows up again.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is any better than any other brush.</li>
            <li>Better than other brushes but no miracle brush.</li>
            <li>But ever she says she likes this brush much better than any other.</li>
            <li>While I had high hopes for this brush, it just does not do the trick on my daughter&#x27;s superfine blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>Fine, spiderweb hair easily tangles, and breaks if pulled too hard.  </li>
            <li>It feels like the plastic is cheaply made and is pretty rough on my daughter&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li>and she didn&#x27;t have a fit, unlike when I brushed her hair with a normal brush at home.</li>
            <li>She loves this brush, barely complains any more about having her hair brushed.</li>
            <li>Great brush for fussy little girl with long hair!</li>
            <li>I am still surprised how this brush got so many good reviews, when for me and my two friends it&#x27;s worse than a regular brush.</li>
            <li>Call it part placebo effect - she has a &amp;#34;special pink brush&amp;#34; now, but it definitely detangles more gently and effectively than other brushes.</li>
            <li>I found out about Knot Genie 2 years ago, i already had a light blue one but decided to get a new color.</li>
            <li>She has very long, fine hair, and brushing always brought tears to both of our eyes.  </li>
            <li>Ultimately, we have found more success with a product called &amp;#34;the wet brush&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I first found this brush when I took my 3 year old for a hair cut.</li>
            <li>This is almost exactly like the brush the hospital sent home with us when my daughter was born (except not as soft).  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t banish all knots (only a true genie could do that)</li>
            <li>It feels very cheap and more like a fake doll brush than something you&#x27;d want to use on your kid.</li>
            <li>(my husband even thought it was a new cat brush when he saw it on the counter!).  </li>
            <li>The only plus I see is that the bristles are so flexible that they bend instead of breaking the hair once they hit the knots (thought the sound is pretty much the same, which I can&#x27;t stand).</li>
            <li>Works great but its big, hard to hold in my hand and there is no way a child could do</li>
            <li>It is amazing especially when used on wet hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks to this, my four year old niece cries a good deal less while getting her hair brushed.</li>
            <li>it will not go thru wet hair easily, and hurts in the process.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>My 3 year old daughter has long fine hair that gets very tangled during bathtime.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s easy to take apart and empty out.</li>
            <li>I will admit, it took some getting used to initially because the bristles are more &amp;#34;sharp and pointy&amp;#34; feeling than regular brushes.</li>
            <li>Plus her older brothers kept stealing hers.  </li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s very comfortable using this little bug.</li>
            <li>I brush from the very top down, holding the bristles against her head and back.  </li>
            <li>It feels to me like it takes a lot more work to actually get her hair snarl free, but maybe not, since she&#x27;ll usually lets me use this brush on her and will try and hide from the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this detangling brush for curlier hair.</li>
            <li>quality item that I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for children.</li>
            <li>Also the price is  too high for this brush.</li>
            <li>highly recommend .</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Do yourself and your child a favor, buy one of these brushes, I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>A friend recommended it, and I didn&#x27;t have high hopes, but it works miracles.</li>
            <li>I bought this in combination with Organic Sprout Miracle Detangler which I also highly recommend.</li>
            <li>highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t believe that her hair was really truly brushed out that easily, so I followed up with my regular brush just to check.  </li>
            <li>The individual bristles are SHARP and kind of raked over my scalp.  </li>
            <li>Better than an average brush!  </li>
            <li>Would be a little more convenient if it had a handle of some sort.</li>
            <li>I have 3 girls ranging in age from 5 to 11 yrs old and ALL three rave about this brush!!</li>
            <li>It fits my daugher&#x27;s adorable and smallish little hand.</li>
            <li>I bought this for a 7 year old grand-daughter with that baby fine waist long hair.</li>
            <li>Works well but kind of hard to hold on to</li>
            <li>My three year old has very long, fine hair</li>
            <li>It is always a struggle when it comes to brushing my 7 year old daughters hair but this product has made the process go much smoother.</li>
            <li>Purchased for my 3 year old who is very tender and hates having hair messed with.  </li>
            <li>But as far as just getting the tangles out beforehand, this works really well.</li>
            <li>From the brushER side, the Knot Genie has better potential, but from the brushEE side, my girls and I prefer the Hair Bean, by a long shot.  </li>
            <li>so I could see if it would be worth it to try on my daughter when she has enough hair to use it.  </li>
            <li>So I bought a few more on Amazon.</li>
            <li>She has thin, fine hair that gets tangled easily.</li>
            <li>a few more to have on hand.</li>
            <li>It would normally take me 4-5 minutes to brush it to where it was tangle-free.</li>
            <li>you can get a nice wooden one for the same price at a local beauty supply store.</li>
            <li>My older daughter has shoulder length wavy fine hair and my younger daughter has fine but thick and straight shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li>Wanted to try it for a few weeks just to be sure, and know what?</li>
            <li>best detangling solution is using a small amount of Chi silk serum in wet hair or J&amp;J detangling spray in dry hair.</li>
            <li>We love it as no other brush, comb or other even came close.</li>
            <li>i received this brush in the mail, I tried using it like a regular brush, expecting it to pull through the tangles right away.  </li>
            <li>Virtually the only time I can get a comb or brush through it is right after washing and conditioning it.  </li>
            <li>In addition to it brushing through the knotty mess, it left her hair smooth and super shiny.</li>
            <li>, it is sort of small, and a bit hard for me to hold onto, and I frequently drop it while trying to comb her hair, but she can  hold it and do it herself perfectly</li>
            <li>Not very impressed with this brush, cheap &amp; cheaply made.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t move through the large knots as well, but for general brushing it works well!  </li>
            <li>Also I realize how desperate I must&#x27;ve been becuase the thing is not worth more than a McDonalds Happy Meal toy.</li>
            <li>With this brush, we still use a little detangling spray, and then she can actually brush her own hair.  </li>
            <li>We are also able to brush her hair with little or no crying.</li>
            <li>It does detangle more gently than a regular brush, but it&#x27;s not worth your money.</li>
            <li>I finally broke down and purchased a more expensive brush, honestly, it was worth the price!</li>
            <li>Perhaps, someday, a new brush will be designed that truly does end the days of hair brushing tears, but this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li>so I was so hoping that this brush would live up to it&#x27;s name.  </li>
            <li>i wanted a new one.</li>
            <li>With our new brush we get through it in 1/2 the time with no tears.</li>
            <li>Not anymore with this new brush.  </li>
            <li>She has shorter straight hair that really doesn&#x27;t even tangle much, but if I try to use it on her hair dry</li>
            <li>she and her sister take turns brushing each other&#x27;s hair works just as expected and better!</li>
            <li>Purchased this for my daughter who has VERY curly hair and absolutely hates getting her hair brushed.</li>
            <li>my girls love pink, and it&#x27;s something different for them.  </li>
            <li>(I have very thick fine hair that is four inches past my shoulder) as I have borrowed my daughters&#x27; and find it way more effective than the wide tooth comb I normally use.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d let a very young child use this without supervision</li>
            <li>highly recommend this knot genie,saves me a lot of time on busy mornings.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this knot genie,saves me a lot of time on busy mornings.</li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t flexible and the bristles aren&#x27;t very soft.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it for little ones with fine hair.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t do any better job than an ordinary brush and if anything I feel it is rougher, her hair always friezes up when I use it and looks like I am causing breakage.</li>
            <li>First this , then brush the ends with a regular brush, then this again.</li>
            <li>, she won&#x27;t even let her 3 siblings near it!</li>
            <li>No more tears from my 5yo when brushing the tangles out :)</li>
            <li>Pretty simple design.</li>
            <li>My Granddaughters just love it; no more fighting with their hair their mom&#x27;s tell me.  </li>
            <li>At first she and her sister didn&#x27;t scream when I brushed their hair with it</li>
            <li>I am so surprised!</li>
            <li>my four year old doesn&#x27;t cry in pain when brushing her hair!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe it when I brushed her hair for the first time with Knot Genie, and she didn&#x27;t complain AT ALL.  </li>
            <li>My son even likes to use it because it&#x27;s so soft!  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>It is honestly the only way I can get through my daughters thick, straight hair without a lot of tears and drama.</li>
            <li>Nothing special,  this is just a regular brush, no more science involve, you can find better or same quality in any store.</li>
            <li>However, they have not complained more or less with these (than they do with regular hair brushes).</li>
            <li>It literally killed the beautiful waves she had in her long mid back length hair.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t fit &amp;#34;nicely&amp;#34; in your hand &amp; pretty hard bristles.</li>
            <li>I am happy to report - no, I&#x27;m ecstatic to report that crying, tangles and pulling on their hair for an eternity is now in our past.</li>
            <li>my daughter has superfine slightly curly hair.</li>
            <li>I drop it way too often and end up switching back to my daughter&#x27;s regular brush/comb but its not a bad product just could use improvement.</li>
            <li>Works great on our little girls sensitive hair, no more tears to brush hair.</li>
            <li>My little girl has shoulder length hair and is on fine.  </li>
            <li>No crying or running away by my curly-haired two year old!  </li>
            <li>Developed by an American mother of three tangle haired daughters with traumatizing childhood memories of her own tangled hair issues, the secret is the different lengths of teeth on the brush, which  bend just right to gently untangle hair.  </li>
            <li>better to work(using this brush to detangle) on dry hair than wet</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve used it on dry and wet hair and we literally don&#x27;t have any more screaming or tears while brushing hair.</li>
            <li>have to say that the knot genie appears to work better on dry hair rather than wet hair.</li>
            <li>The bristles are stiff and don&#x27;t easily move.</li>
            <li>It only brushes the top layer and everything underneath is still a tangled mess.  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased to try one on myself before my daughter had long enough hair to brush</li>
            <li>And then, when they or I drop it - because is it slippery, and too large to hold well, it comes apart and needs to be popped back together.</li>
            <li>in all, while it&#x27;s not perfect, my daughter generally will let me use the &amp;#34;special brush&amp;#34; on her and that alone is worth a lot! :)</li>
            <li>I am sure it is intentional, to help with thick or long hair, but just be aware of this if you have a sensitive child!</li>
            <li>Brush\\&quot; a much smaller version of the original, which can be purchased for whole $4 less.</li>
            <li>My four year old daughter did not say ouch once the whole time I brushed her hair.</li>
            <li>While the name of this item clearly states: \\&quot;Knot Genie Detangling</li>
            <li>My eight-year-old daughter has been using the Knot Genie Detangling brush since early last year and absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>The hair underneath is still tangled and can only be reached by brushing the hair in sections- very time consuming.</li>
            <li>She also doesn&#x27;t complain as much when we use this brush vs a regular comb.</li>
            <li>Brushing hair after bathtime has been my least favorite time of the day for awhile.  </li>
            <li>Can also be used for adult hair that is below the shoulders.</li>
            <li>I purchased this brush for my 3 year old granddaughter.  </li>
            <li>titular web site claims that they \\&quot;were created for every mom that&#x27;s endured the foot stomping and screaming matches that come with brushing their child&#x27;s hair,\\&quot;</li>
            <li>We have issues when it comes to brushing my 2 year old hair.  </li>
            <li>Having to fight my daughter to brush her hair daily is very tiring.</li>
            <li>no crying or screaming at me that it hurt.</li>
            <li>It slid through her hair much easier than any traditional brush</li>
            <li>I bought 3 of these so far.</li>
            <li>When brushing, the bristles will bend to slide over the knot making the brush completely ineffective.</li>
            <li>Instead of spending several minutes spraying tons of detangler and trying to gently comb out knots, I am done in like 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li>My adult daughter</li>
            <li>I have 3 young granddaughters.  </li>
            <li>My two year old</li>
            <li>absolutely hates to have her hair brushed.</li>
            <li>What took 1-2 minutes to brush, I can now complete in seconds.</li>
            <li>This brush is gentle enough for her not to scream and yet still gets the knots out of her hair.</li>
            <li>But kids really like them and that alone is a big help.</li>
            <li>This brush would probably rate 5 stars if an adult were using it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what it is, but my 5 year old gets some gnarly tangles in her hair.  </li>
            <li>Wow, what a difference a hair brush can make- literally no tears, no crying,</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 5-yr old for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Bought for our 3 year old Granddaughter, I thought it would help in detangling her hair.  </li>
            <li>I also have an 18 month old and she lets me use this on her with no problem.</li>
            <li>no crying</li>
            <li>I really do think the brush works though, because we recently left it at a hotel</li>
            <li>No matter how gentle we&#x27;ve been, it was just not enough, until now.  </li>
            <li>My daughter is mixed so her hair is very curly.</li>
            <li>My daughter wants to try to the one currently being shown on TV in commercials</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 4 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this because my five year old daughter would literally run off when I tried to brush or comb her hair.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair soft, shiny and no hair in the brush afterward.</li>
            <li>Use this brush for our 8 and 4 year old girls.  </li>
            <li>son has longer-than-average hair and would wince and complain any time a hairbrush even came near him.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve purchased three Knot Genies so far - one for home, one for the car and one for my daughter&#x27;s school bag.</li>
            <li>she&#x27;s always recommending it to young cousins and friends.  </li>
            <li>My two-year old girls let me brush their hair with it, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to pull.</li>
            <li>Well, I should say her 7-yr old brother tried it on her yesterday</li>
            <li>and she nearly screamed her lungs out.</li>
            <li>So I bought this for my 3 yo curly head daughter who absolutely hates to get her hair brushed.</li>
            <li>WOW..</li>
            <li>When her hair is wet and freshly conditioned it works</li>
            <li>This brush is the one she is willing to use to brush her hair out, and she doesn&#x27;t seem to complain about the knots as much as she does when using other brushes!</li>
            <li>There are no little rounded tips on the bristles, so my children complain if this runs over their ears and neck - which is frequently, give</li>
            <li>She cried more than usual when I tried to brush her hair with it!</li>
            <li>This is small and easy, fits in the palm of her hand</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the first brush I&#x27;ve used on my daughter&#x27;s hair that can detangle dry hair.</li>
            <li>I tried it right on a tangled spot on her DRY hair and to my amazement there was no pulling!!  </li>
            <li>I tried starting from the bottom like a regular brush, I tried starting from the top and brushing straight down like one reviewer recommended.</li>
            <li>old is a crazy sleeper and her hair is so fine it gets knots quite easily.</li>
            <li>I have long, wavy, super thick hair that is pretty much a recipe for disaster when it comes to tangles.</li>
            <li>Her hair is very thick and tangles very easily.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This may be an okay brush if there arent serious tangles to deal with</li>
            <li>I decided to finally contact the manufacturer and make them aware of a possible defect.  </li>
            <li>My 3 year old had long hair and we got this to help get the knots out without too much tugging.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are pretty sharp, so you just have to be sure not to press too hard when you brush.  </li>
            <li>It works right through knotted baby fine hair with little or no trauma to the little girls.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t pull through very well, and it just doesn&#x27;t seem to be any better than any other inexpensive brush I&#x27;ve tried on her in the past - and I feel like I have tried them all.  </li>
            <li>Got two of these last year, one for each of my granddaughters, one with very fine hair and one thick and curly.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for these especially since they are $20.00 per brush.</li>
            <li>so well,yes it will take a little getting use to how to brush your hair with it ,Most people do not treat there hair right, so i think learning that to the people that have bad experiances with it cause it has been so much better with it,</li>
            <li>Our little girl has thick, long hair and is always complaining when we brush it, but this brush does seem to go through her hair much more easily that the others.  </li>
            <li>It tangles very easily, and I am pretty sure she somehow does gymnastics in bed, and she wakes up with nasty hair.</li>
            <li>The only down side of this is that the brush part and the pink backing can come apart fairly easily if dropped but it pops right back on.</li>
            <li>So, I tried it out on my long curly hair and it really did work wonders.</li>
            <li>My daughter has long wavy hair and it gets very tangled up.</li>
            <li>I. I have long straight hair and my daughter has curly medium length hair.</li>
            <li>My daughter can easily fit it in her hand, and it&#x27;s not too small to get lost in mine or my husband&#x27;s hand.</li>
            <li>I am sure it works for some bit was not good for my daughters curly hair</li>
            <li>and my hair is back to normal.</li>
            <li>Service was prompt and exactly waht I expected</li>
            <li>Works good a little hard to hold onto.</li>
            <li>Works quickly and causes little to no pain.</li>
            <li>It separates snags and tangles quickly and with little fuss.</li>
            <li>It hurt more than a regular brush which actually never hurt me since I have a pretty tough scalp.</li>
            <li>small little brush for the detangled hair, Quality is very cheap for the price though !</li>
            <li>She still doesn&#x27;t like it because it has hard bristles, but it&#x27;s a much better alternative to regular brushes or combs.</li>
            <li>Wish I new about this brush earlier.</li>
            <li>Camoflage]] is available, but no Hunter&#x27;s Orange, at least not so far.</li>
            <li>However, she wants to use it on dry hair as well.  </li>
            <li>sensitive scalp,hold the hair in your hand away from skin as much as possible.&lt;br /&gt;7.For a finishing touch,can use a wide tooth comb after brushing with knot genie.</li>
            <li>My granddaughter has curly hair and this brush did absolutely nothing different than a regular brush would do.</li>
            <li>The second I opened the package, I decided to put it to the ultimate test and brush my daughter&#x27;s hair after she had been at school the whole day.</li>
            <li>Every morning I spent 10-15 minutes trying to detangle my 7 year old&#x27;s shoulder length straight hair ,which gets all matted and knotted after sleep.</li>
            <li>Thick hair requires brushing top and underside of hair as prickles are too short to go thru hair.</li>
            <li>Essentially the same as the Hair Bean (long and short plastic bristles to really get the tangles out), except this one has stiffer bristles, which gives a little more oomph, but also makes it scratchier.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my 4 year old daughter, she has long hair and she will play with it creating large knots in the back of her head.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>She has a very sensitive head and hates tangles being brushed out.  </li>
            <li>so i would literally have to hold the top (pink part) together with the black (brush part)!</li>
            <li>It is also great for making ponytails as the brush has a slight curve for a wider base to gather hair and get it smooth.</li>
            <li>This little brush is worth every stinkin&#x27; penny.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money and a must-have for any household with little girls.</li>
            <li>I have very thick, curly hair and my stylist used this on me before my latest wash and cut.</li>
            <li>I initially thought that the bristles might be a little rough, but I tried it on my 2 year old anyway and was surprised at how quickly it worked!</li>
            <li>They are cheap plastic and the bristles are hard and hurt.</li>
            <li>: This product will obviously also work on male hair for males with hair long enough for tangling to be an issue, but the color scheme most men would be willing to be caught dead with is a bit limited.  </li>
            <li>Camoflage]] is available, but no Hunter&#x27;s Orange, at least not so far.t will obviously also work on male hair for males with hair long enough for tangling to be an issue, but the color scheme most men would be willing to be caught dead with is a bit limited.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine for her hand, which means it&#x27;s too small for mine!</li>
            <li>In general, it slides through her &amp;#34;rat&#x27;s nest&amp;#34; with ease.</li>
            <li>Made of cheap plastic and works no better than a regular comb or brush.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see it being very durable or long lasting (speculation) nor do I see it justifying the $10 to $15 price</li>
            <li>My 3 year old has long, naturally wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this for my 2 1/2 year old daughters fuzzy morning and after nap hair, just the fuzzies on the back of her head.</li>
            <li>My 18 month old daughter gets rats in the back of hair every once in a while.</li>
            <li>My squirmy three year old hates sitting still to have her hair brushed, so I always dreaded that chore.</li>
            <li>Works very well with wet hair.</li>
            <li>Daily hair brushing is a nightmare for my almost 4 year old.</li>
            <li>My daughter inherited my sensitive scalp, and always makes a fuss about having her hair brushed, so my mother-in-law sent us one of these.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also a mom of two girls with extra sensitive scalps.</li>
            <li>My 6 year old daughter hates having her hair brushed.  </li>
            <li>Overall a good purchase for my 3 year old with crazy curly hair.</li>
            <li>My daughter has medium thick hair and the bristles aren&#x27;t strong enough to get the knots out.</li>
            <li>daughter has very long hair which tangles easily, and has always disliked having her hair brushed.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and thought I need to give it a try, since most comments were positive.. trying this on dry hair totally failed..</li>
            <li>The Knot Genie slides right through their hair whether it be wet or dry.</li>
            <li>With my girls I used to pull the side braids together at the back and secure with a small elastic and pull the back braids over before undoing them.</li>
            <li>If your child has thick hair, work in small sections by separating the hair and use a good detangling spray or leave in conditioner if the hair is extra tangled.</li>
            <li>The model who has straight, shiny conditioned or oiled THIN STRAIGHT hair that the brush is slipping right through.so</li>
            <li>The bristles are a hard, very pointy plastic and no matter how gently we use it, my daughter cries.</li>
            <li>I find that it works particularly well when her hair is wet.</li>
            <li>Does a  really good job quickly detangling my three daughters&#x27; hair, which ranges from thick and curly to fine and awfully tangly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been so surprised to get a bad product after reading such good reviews about it.</li>
            <li>I have long hair and so does my 5 year old.</li>
            <li>We have no more hair pulling drama with our toddler, and that makes it worth it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the first time she used a brush that didn&#x27;t pull out her fluffy hair</li>
            <li>The construction of this product is average, this size of the product fits in a large hand but is manageable for smaller hands.</li>
            <li>Fathers and daughters share a special bond, part of which is based upon the (initial at least) belief by daughters that their fathers can fix anything and by their fathers&#x27; willingness to walk through a wall of fire rather than disappoint them.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to get this product because my 6 year old daughter has very easily-tangled hair, and I was desperate for anything that wouldn&#x27;t make her burst into tears while using.  </li>
            <li>My 4 year old has very long hair</li>
            <li>My hair is straight and tangles much less</li>
            <li>My 4 year old daughter hates getting her long hair brushed after baths.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for super thick and course hair</li>
            <li>I have used detangler sprays before but this brush detangled easily in just a few seconds no spray and little effort.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s this odd shape, which makes it ok for adults, but hard for my kids (2 and 4) to hold and brush by themselves.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first with some of the reviews; after years of fighting with my girls hair who wouldn&#x27;t be, right?  </li>
            <li>B0074AR8UY Knot Genie Detangling Brush]] is made in a ridiculous number of colors and two different sizes: the original and the 20% smaller</li>
            <li>That being said, I do love the product and my daughter is already happier about having her hair brushed so the positive outweighs the bad.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my little girl, who doesn&#x27;t have much hair yet.</li>
            <li>We have several older Knot Genie brushes that had worn down over time.  </li>
            <li>For parents of very young kids: the bristles on the brush are reasonably sharp</li>

            <li> While this brush has great intentions, it didn&#x27;t work for us like we were hoping.</li>

            <li> This is amazing!</li>
            <li> I cannot fully express how amazing this brush is!</li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing!  </li>
            <li> Amazing !</li>
            <li> Very impressed and pleased.</li>
            <li> Great brush it is so loved by my granddaughter.</li>
            <li> She can now brush her hair on her own without ripping her hair out!</li>
            <li> and she loves brushing her own hair with it too!</li>
            <li> and she will even brush her own hair now!</li>
            <li> Once I found how it works best for us, separating and brushing in sections, it is so easy.</li>
            <li> Will continue searching for a good detangler brush for kids</li>
            <li> This does work fairly well.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly this works</li>
            <li> My kids loved those brushes.  </li>
            <li> This is generally a good brush.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and honestly did not expect great things.</li>
            <li> and i got to try it out and loved it</li>
            <li> a good conditioner after rinsing shampoo.</li>
            <li> but it does get rid of a good 90% of them.</li>
            <li> The size is good too.</li>
            <li> Ive also used it on my own hair in the shower as a shampoo brush and it gives a great scalp massage.</li>
            <li> We will just stick to using a good detangler and brush/comb.</li>
            <li> the price is good, even it is for kids, we can use it too.</li>
            <li> good for hair.</li>
            <li> My 3 year-old daughter has beautiful curly hair, but it meant many mornings combing out tons of knots.  </li>
            <li> Which is great for brushing her hair and even better when she plays with my hair and then brushes it.</li>
            <li> Worth the $$ for sure!!!</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Kids love this brush!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> This thing is like magic!  </li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> So glad I bought this!</li>
            <li> I love this brush!</li>
            <li> We love this brush!</li>
            <li> So.. not it is laying around the house and we are using it on our cat, who seems to like it much better!</li>
            <li> Works great, easy to grip.</li>
            <li> This brush had a handle and claimed that it was great at not pulling hair and going through knots easily.</li>
            <li> This brush has made brushing my 3 yr olds hair a much more pleasant experience.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to hold and does a great job moving through her hair.  </li>
            <li> The knot genie now makes this event in our house much more pleasant.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing...  </li>
            <li> This brush is amazing.</li>
            <li> It works, but was not as amazing as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> This brush had reviews that it was amazing.  </li>
            <li> This thing is amazing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just amazing</li>
            <li> Amazing at removing knots.  </li>
            <li> All in all the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing for toddlers.  </li>
            <li> Again, it performed amazingly...</li>
            <li> this brush is amazing.</li>
            <li> This brush feels cheap, didn&#x27;t do a great job on tangles and made my daughter&#x27;s hair frizzy.</li>
            <li> It is truly amazing.  </li>
            <li> I was suspect of all the rave reviews - but I must say, it is amazing.</li>
            <li> But it really works best if you used in combination with a leave in conditioner ...</li>
            <li> It also works nicely to distribute the oils in your hair to give it a nice shine</li>
            <li> but it depends on what kind of activity has endured before brushing.</li>
            <li> pro is that my daughter likes to hold it on her own and brush her own hair.&lt;br /&gt;The con of that</li>
            <li> so this is a nice solution that doesn&#x27;t involve drenching her hair in de-tangler or conditioner.</li>
            <li> But effective.</li>
            <li> Nice to have no complaints when brushing kids hair.</li>
            <li> Nice brush for baby girl&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> she brushes her own hair too.</li>
            <li> it is nice</li>
            <li> I wish I had picked a more neutral color because her brother loves it and said it felt good, Before school the three kids get themselves dressed and groomed.</li>
            <li> I tried on my own hair and it couldn&#x27;t even brush through it.</li>
            <li> My kids have very knotty hair, and this has been wonderful for them.  </li>
            <li> and she is 5 and can brush her own hair with this brush.</li>
            <li> and I have my own system with how I must get through their hair.</li>
            <li> She loves brushing her own hair now which takes a lot of stress out of the morning.</li>
            <li> She will even brush her own hair, and my husband noted it&#x27;s miraculous ability to brush virtually painlessly.</li>
            <li> This is the miracle brush that every parent should own.</li>
            <li> The bristles just kind of go around them instead, basically ignoring them.  </li>
            <li> I bought each of them their own.</li>
            <li> Fits in my hand nicely, as well as hers.</li>
            <li> She also LOVES brushing her own hair now.</li>
            <li> My daughter likes to brush her own hair now</li>
            <li> Love love love this!!  </li>
            <li> I loved it so much I gave it as Christmas gifts to friends who have girls - they loved it!</li>
            <li> Its quick, easy, and my daughters hair looks great!  </li>
            <li> anymore this brush is worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful well constructed invention, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Practice make perfect with this product, but so far, I am pleased with its results!</li>
            <li> no problems at all, holds well, soft touch bristles and one happy child, thank you works great</li>
            <li> This size is also perfect -- says its made for kid hands, but this fits my adult hand nicely  -</li>
            <li> The quick delivery and pricing were great.</li>
            <li> Our hairdresser recommended this to help with our daughter&#x27;s hair which tends to get knotted very easily even with conditioner and de-tangler.  </li>
            <li> the bristles bend very easily also.</li>
            <li> but this brush did not make it very easy</li>
            <li> Best buy so far!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s assessment, and those of many reviewers were not wrong - this is an amazing product!!  </li>
            <li> As for shipping, it was pretty good!  </li>
            <li> very smooth brushing, no tugging, and I will be using it on her hair and my own while travelling overseas.</li>
            <li> It is good for fine hair too.</li>
            <li> She is now able to brush her own hair without problems.</li>
            <li> Granddaughter with sensitive scalp is very happy!</li>
            <li> it the most amazing brush ever</li>
            <li> She brushes her own every day and there is never any more tears.  </li>
            <li> No matter how tangled her hair is, the Knot Genie goes right through without pulling and now her hair looks great all of the time.  </li>
            <li> Easy to comb snarls out!</li>
            <li> This brush makes combing through her hair so easy!</li>
            <li> /&gt;3.If hair is exceptionally frizzy,I use some  coconut oil to smooth hair out and unknot the tangles before showering,then shampoo it</li>
            <li> Okay, I thought - it requires the loving touch of mom to do well :).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle brush, but it&#x27;s pretty great and works for us.</li>
            <li> You know what they say:  if it sounds too good to be true...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and easy, plus her hair looks great.</li>
            <li> it is very cheap plastic feeling</li>
            <li> to the purchase of this item, everything went very smooth.</li>
            <li> up!!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;It does however work great for my daughter that has super fine hair.</li>
            <li> It works good to get out tangles quickly</li>
            <li> I will admit that I didn&#x27;t quite use it as directed at first, and it did result in her backing away from it suspiciously, but when she tried it herself and got used to holding it the right way, it worked great!  </li>
            <li> A huge plus!</li>
            <li> Also it doesn&#x27;t catch the hair as well, and so we need more strokes to brush out the tangles.</li>
            <li> I am sure many of you riding these reviews are hoping in vain for a magic brush to ease the struggle as I was.</li>
            <li> She wont let me brush it more after she is &amp;#34;done&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> It does get the tangles out of the top layer if that is all you want.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this brush.</li>
            <li> We tried a lot of combs and this one has worked better than the others.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe more people haven&#x27;t told me about this miracle product.</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t call it a &amp;#34;genie&amp;#34;  maybe just the name to make kids feel better about their hair being ripped out?</li>
            <li> It is fantastic for knots!</li>
            <li> and I sometimes think the brush adds to frizziness but I am not 100 percent sure.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the product.  </li>
            <li> I would have like to have been a better made product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to run the Knot Genie in her hair without the tears that often show up with brushing.</li>
            <li> Comes in variety of cute colors and patterns.</li>
            <li> It really works great</li>
            <li> Definitely a worthwhile purchase.</li>
            <li> I to keep one here for when my grand daughters visit, and one for each my grand daughters to have at their houses.</li>
            <li> I have also recommended purchasing one to my friends to have on hand for their grand daughters.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> and now she loves brushing her hair because it doesn&#x27;t hurt and I love it because it get tangles out with no complaints.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> She gets so many tangles</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very happy with this brush.</li>
            <li> Why would you make a fantastic brush that comes apart?!?</li>
            <li> But it does it&#x27;s job getting the knots out without a screaming fit!</li>
            <li> I still LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s been better than the alternative.</li>
            <li> There are way better brushes out there.  </li>
            <li> She still won&#x27;t always let me brush her hair, but it&#x27;s so much better since I got this.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure when buying</li>
            <li> The tapered and flexible pins do not snag the hair like most brushes do.  </li>
            <li> She now uses this brush herself and gets amazingly tangle free hair.</li>
            <li> Loved it so much, I had to go and get my own.</li>
            <li> Love this brush for our daughter who hates to brush her hair.  </li>
            <li> and i love it</li>
            <li> Maybe I was expecting miracles, but this thing is just ok.</li>
            <li> and though I wanted to rave about it, I think it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li> I ended up purchasing another brush that worked much better.</li>
            <li> so glad this product is out there for all who have hair problems</li>
            <li> I was hoping this was going to be the magical answer</li>
            <li> so well my grand daughter who used to cry and fuss as her mom tried to comb out her hair tangles now turns to her mother and says &amp;#34;That&#x27;s it?</li>
            <li> My grand daughter had this so caught up in her hair</li>
            <li> My wife uses this brush for our daughter&#x27;s hair every morning, they absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> My kids scream more with this brush then the one I had used before.</li>
            <li> My daughter still doesn&#x27;t like having her hair combed, but this has made it much better</li>
            <li> and she was asking every day if the \\&quot;magic brush\\&quot; was here.</li>
            <li> But, ok, working with what we have, we tried it.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off using a rounded brush.</li>
            <li> This gets the knots out pain free!</li>
            <li> There is nothing magical about the knot genie brush.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve NEVER been able to comb/brush through ALL of her hair.  </li>
            <li> it is just a brush.  :)</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Works much better then a comb or brush.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work....</li>
            <li> Strangers love to touch her hair all the time.</li>
            <li> But MOSt detanglers work for that type of hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d think it was more of a $4 item</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> -- but any brush works okay then.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> what makes this brush work so much better, but it is a life saver.  </li>
            <li> she co-operates so much better.</li>
            <li> We love this brush.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t made with magic or pixie dust, but it&#x27;s simple design is perfect for my hair as well as my daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> but I was able to get it cheaper on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> We still use detangler (I&#x27;ve got some Avon stuff she likes) to give us an edge, but this works much better than the comb or brush we were using before.</li>
            <li> this brush is fabulous!</li>
            <li> /&gt;NO more harmful chemical detangler sprays ,which never worked by the way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;NO more harmful chemical detangler sprays ,which never worked by the way.</li>
            <li> This brush makes it much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure hair type might be a factor here.  </li>
            <li> will say that I gave it to my daughter for Christmas from Santa, and that the hype of that alone got her attention because I told her it was probably magic.  </li>
            <li> We have tried many brushes and detanglers.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had shopped around more.</li>
            <li> This brush plus water is definitely the best combination we&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> She let&#x27;s me brush her hair again :)</li>
            <li> And it is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I found this brush at a hair salon and bought 2 more online just so we could always find one.  </li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> w/Aussie leave in conditiioner:-)</li>
            <li> Its not painless, but it is definitely better then using a comb.  </li>
            <li> I was very excited about the idea of purchasing this product.  </li>
            <li> I have always had very fine hair, which tangles easily.  </li>
            <li> This has made it so much easier to keep her hair looking nice!</li>
            <li> This brush is AMAZING at quickly getting through the tangles ...</li>
            <li> I ususally do not write many reviews, but feel so strongly against this product after trying it that I was compelled to do so.</li>
            <li> It detangles the top layer of hair, yet after a week of use I noticed a rats nest under the top smooth hair on my daughters head.  </li>
            <li> Works like magic on my girl&#x27;s fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I love this brush for my daughter&#x27;s super curly hair!</li>
            <li> When I used it to blow dry my hair, I was impressed at how easy it was to use since it had the handle.</li>
            <li> To my surprise, the brush went right through her hair with no pulling, and even better no screaming!</li>
            <li> The Knot Genie did a very good job of getting through her hair without pulling and yanking as much as a regular comb or brush.  </li>
            <li> This was a gift from my very sweet husband.</li>
            <li> Found a brush called the wet brush that works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> Since I have fine hair, it does tend to get staticky more easily, but then again it&#x27;s also winter which doesn&#x27;t help.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok brush, but doesn&#x27;t detangle as pain free as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> However, I find this brush works best if the hair is wet.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to give this 5 stars since the product was so good</li>
            <li> Bought 2 gave one to a friend I loved so much.....</li>
            <li> The smaller size of this one works great when my daughter wants to comb her own hair- and mine!</li>
            <li> My oldest was so excited to get this brush and has tried to use it over and over but ends up in tears more when she uses it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even bother with the knot genie, go get a brush that detangles hair and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I had hoped that the tears would be gone and bathtime would be easy.  </li>
            <li> making the process of removing tangles easy or painless.</li>
            <li> After bath time it was easy as well.  </li>
            <li> Everyone had such great reviews of this brush so I was hoping to love it.</li>
            <li> It easily gets tangled.  </li>
            <li> The knots are easily removed with out a struggle.  </li>
            <li> Fits in their hands easily.</li>
            <li> Easy for Mom to use and</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy for her to use.</li>
            <li> Both my hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair tangle easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t slip out of her hand easily.</li>
            <li> I can now easily brush her hair and it does not hurt her at all.  </li>
            <li> So it helps very much, but I still need the detangling spray for both of them, whichever kind of brush I use.  </li>
            <li> WOW, this brush is amazing!</li>
            <li> This brush is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> My daughter has shoulder length fine hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 3 and has beautiful curly blonde hair</li>
            <li> Her hair tends to have a dullest quality to it, and this brush not only worked out the tangles, but made her hair look so shiny and beautiful.  </li>
            <li> Would not brush through the hair and leaves it full of static.</li>
            <li> , I open the Knot Genie, start at my scalp, and the brush easily glides all the way to the end of my hair with nary a snag!!!</li>
            <li> you need a brush, go for it, this one is fine.</li>
            <li> I use it myself from time to time and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> , the product seems to be fine and it arrived on or before the day it was promised.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have fine, curly hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter has fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend unless you have shorter, fine hair to use it on.</li>
            <li> Even though my hair is fine, I have a lot of it.  </li>
            <li> No more screaming and pulling and tugging,no more threatens to cut hair length,and best of all,she can sometimes do it herself.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> my granddaughter&#x27;s hairy is fine</li>
            <li> This hairbrush works fine, i guess?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really understand the mechanics of why it works better, it just does!</li>
            <li> I have tightly coiled hair and this works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Hair brushing, washing, anything - is a huge fight with my kids.  </li>
            <li> It was alright, but didn&#x27;t make a huge difference.</li>
            <li> It gently eases tangles out tear free, and can be a valuable training tool to teaching your child to brush his/her own hair.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s pain free</li>
            <li> Who has to hide in the basement, the garage, or the den for an hour with the light off after making his daughter cry?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was&#x27;t sure that almost $10 was worth paying for a brush.</li>
            <li> All I can say is, believe those great reviews - it actually works!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great brush for younger kids with lots of tangles</li>
            <li> Every morning is a screaming fit about brushing hair.  </li>
            <li> Once you get a section completely free braid it so it doesn&#x27;t tangle.</li>
            <li> My hair is smooth and feels healthier.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable to hold in my hand and just glides through her</li>
            <li> thing is a cheap pieces of junk.</li>
            <li> They had it available for purchase</li>
            <li> we get all untangled and silky smooth by then.&lt;br /&gt;8.For</li>
            <li> It works, but not hurt free.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the sound it makes as I&#x27;m brushing her hair with it.  </li>
            <li> month later, she HAPPILY brushes her hair, (which in itself, is a miracle.)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a FANTASTIC investment for ANY child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap, but not cheaply-made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And the SOUND of trying to get through the knots was so troubling</li>
            <li> It was like the sound of brushing my dog&#x27;s (a goldendoodle) hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought one of these not expecting much, but it is amazing.  </li>
            <li> She has beautiful long hair.</li>
            <li> but with this so far so good, it helps with the knots and helps with all the complaining.</li>
            <li> and so far so good.</li>
            <li> She can finally brush though her own hair on her own.</li>
            <li> love this comb works so well on my daughter super long hair and is great for tangles</li>
            <li> But, I am happy to say the positive reviews are right on, it really, REALLY helps get their hair smoothed out and looking great with little or no fuss, great product, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My 3-year-old daughter&#x27;s fine hair would get so many tangles in it, and I&#x27;d make a funny story about the rat&#x27;s having a party in her hair while she slept to keep her distracted while I worked and worked to get the snarls out.  </li>
            <li> I use a comb and normal brush when she&#x27;s not looking that does a better job!  </li>
            <li> We can get her hair done so quickly and easily with this comb.</li>
            <li> When my daughter gets a bit older and combs her own hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;We are sure to spray a detangler first because without that it wouuldn&#x27;t work quite as smoothly.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has had very unruly hair from birth that would tangle and get knots very easily.</li>
            <li> I use this on my daughter&#x27;s hair straight out of the bath, and it glides through her hair very easily, from scalp to ends.</li>
            <li> She has very very curly/knotty/nappy hair :)</li>
            <li> Thus came quickly, the works great with my daughters long thing easily tangled hair....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m considering getting the larger model for my own hair!</li>
            <li> Both girls dislike it in general, and we have nothing good to say about it</li>
            <li> She actually even brushes her own hair!  </li>
            <li> it was worth every penny!</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the expense!</li>
            <li> When it arrived both my daughter and I were excited to try it out and to our surprise</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this brush after reading about it in a magazine and reading the reviews here.</li>
            <li> Also, she has super fine wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> She was so excited when this came in the mail.</li>
            <li> Worth it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great at brushing her long, tangled hair and doesn&#x27;t seem to hurt.</li>
            <li> I gave it 2 stars rather than 1 because it is cute, therefore somewhat more appealing to a toddler than a regular brush.is cute, therefore somewhat more appealing to a toddler than a regular brush.</li>
            <li> pretty sure there are no fairies inside the brush,</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and was excited to try this brush.</li>
            <li> Very nice and painless detangling (and break-free), even on dry (though lightly moisterized) hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter found it fun and easy to use.</li>
            <li> my 6 year old can&#x27;t fit her hand around it to comb her own hair.</li>
            <li> Sure enough we bought out own and she brushes her hair or lets me do it everynight without complaining.</li>
            <li> To be fair, it&#x27;s my fault for believing that a brush could have some magical quality to it, but after reading the glowing reviews, I honestly expected some technological advance to exist in this brush that helped detangle hair.</li>
            <li> The original size fills my large hand so the Teeny Genie size might be a better choice for the Small Handed in addition to being the perfect size for young daughters brushing their own hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> Not the best brush on my super thick haired girl, but luckily she has a tougher head, too!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my 6 year old granddaughter, who has very fine, easily tangled hair.</li>
            <li> Nothing special.  </li>
            <li> I have yet found a way that this is anything special.</li>
            <li> Just went right through the knots in one stroke!</li>
            <li> My 6 y.o. daughter has long, very fine hair that tangles very easy and</li>
            <li> It is great for wet detangling hair.</li>
            <li> this brush works great on their wet hair.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve also found that if I apply some Argan Nut Oil on my daughter&#x27;s wet hair before brushing, the result is great as the oil helps strengthen the hair and makes for easier brushing.</li>
            <li> daughter has straight hair that doesn&#x27;t have many tangles,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> She love it and wants another one to keep in our camper.</li>
            <li> Worked reasonably well and better than combing alone.</li>
            <li> I use it for my daughter&#x27;s hair which is really curly, this brush help with combing and defining her curls evern more.</li>
            <li> Thanks:)</li>
            <li> Their hair is also different lengths and types but the knot genie is loved by all of them.</li>
            <li> What I love about this detangling brush is that it makes getting the tangles out a much faster process.</li>
            <li> so I know what a fair comparison is to a regular brush.  </li>
            <li> This one is NOT pain-free but it is VERY pain-minimal and she has the most tangle-prone hair of any kid I&#x27;ve ever met.  </li>
            <li> My daughter loves this brush so much I&#x27;ve bought two more - one for use in school and another for when she goes swimming.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not nearly as bad.</li>
            <li> The brush cleans up very easily and looks like new still.  </li>
            <li> I think it is great, but I do not not notice a HUGE difference in less pain.</li>
            <li> It worked great on wet hair too!  </li>
            <li> THIS IS A MUST purchase, MUST MUST MUST, your daughter will love brusing her own hair and you will love no more tears</li>
            <li> Super Cheaply made or price paid, but works ok so far.</li>
            <li> I thought first that it was just me, or my girl has super tangled hair, but two of my friends borrowed it from me and it didn&#x27;t work for any of them (at all!)</li>
            <li> She prefers it so much more than a regular brush, and I am glad to no longer hear her whine or cry every time I brush her hair.</li>
            <li> Brushing my daughter&#x27;s hair is now a quick and painless process.</li>
            <li> However the reason I bought this particular \\&quot;0.13  ounce Fairy Pink\\&quot; Knot Genie brush was because I thought it was the teeny genie, so that my girls could eventually brush their own hair and the brush would fit better into their smaller hands...</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s super quick and doesn&#x27;t hurt one bit.</li>
            <li> This does the trick painlessly and quickly.</li>
            <li> , it gets the job done so quickly.  </li>
            <li> My girls do not want me using any other brush, they love this thing!!</li>
            <li> It does work slightly better than a normal brush</li>
            <li> It is nice for her scalp but doesn&#x27;t work any better than other brushes at trying to get her to let me brush her hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush because hair brushing was becoming a real battle.  </li>
            <li> First, the quality of this brush just seems really, really, cheap.  </li>
            <li> Bought for my three-year-old daughter&#x27;s very fine soft hair.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old daughter has very fine, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> My 6 year old daughter has baby fine hair that knots easily.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m happy because less drama.</li>
            <li> Makes the mornings soooo much easier :) I would suggest for curly or straight hair!</li>
            <li> It gets tangled easily because I wear it up so much.  </li>
            <li> No matter how adorable Sesame Street detangler might be, nobody wants their hair doused with so much detangler that it looks like she didn&#x27;t even wash her hair!</li>
            <li> Brushing is so much faster with the Knot Genie!!</li>
            <li> I straightened my hair for the first times in months!</li>
            <li> It is a must have that I wish I would have discovered much sooner!!</li>
            <li> Highly reccomend it!!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was hoping for. 5 stars!</li>
            <li> My daughters do not have super thick or really knotty hair, so I don&#x27;t know how it works on that type of hair, but for their hair, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> This was by far the most gentle and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I bough a real one brush, with fine bristles for $4 at the nearby *</li>
            <li> daughter has the type of hair that always seems to look tangled and unbrushed 5 minutes after a thorough brushing, even with good conditioner (long, strong hair but not thick).  </li>
            <li> My daughter has very curly fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I think this brush may work on a lot of types of hair, but fine and straight is not one of them.</li>
            <li> Great for our little girl&#x27;s knotty hair.</li>
            <li> Great of wet hair!!!</li>
            <li> they are all light plastic and don&#x27;t really do much.</li>
            <li> but I think it was well worth the $$.</li>
            <li> this brush is 100% worth the money.</li>
            <li> My daughter has thick straight hair, while my friend&#x27;s daughter has thinner curlier hair - it worked great for both girls!</li>
            <li> It was worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Grand daughter 4 crys while you do her hair no matter how her hair is extremely sensitive</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve bought many brushes for our childs sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> Soft and gentle, and effective on both cat and dog...</li>
            <li> This brush seemed like the answer to our prayers - not only would it detangle but no tears, no screaming and she could brush her own hair.  </li>
            <li> but they must have figured out it wasn&#x27;t fun that way</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the $10 or so.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still holding up for us, but then we rarely use this brush.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the $$</li>
            <li> Other than that I love this brush and so does my hair :)</li>
            <li> My daughter was excited to be able to have her hair brushed without my help or having it hurt.  </li>
            <li> She was excited about the color, size, and name of this brush when it arrived in the mail- especially after I assured her it would make the brushing experience much more tolerable.  </li>
            <li> I learned the cream rinse trick from a good friend that has a grandchild with that black nappy super fine\curly hair.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my 3 year old whose hair tangles super easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough to fit in her hand and the comb works great!</li>
            <li> went right thru it.  </li>
            <li> She would do it but not the right way.</li>
            <li> , I came home and ordered this right away.</li>
            <li> It glides right through the hair.  </li>
            <li> I can hear it going through the tangles, but it brushes right through without hurting her.  </li>
            <li> And they&#x27;re right.</li>
            <li> Purchased it as an add on so the price was right.</li>
            <li> Yeah right, you&#x27;re probable thinking - you don&#x27;t know MY kid&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I did not have to use detangler spray, it glided right through her hair</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s way right through.</li>
            <li> Maybe I wasn&#x27;t using it right</li>
            <li> I used it in the morning, and with 5 quick strokes her entire head was tangle free and so smooth.  </li>
            <li> This worked great on my 3 year old granddaughter&#x27;s curly, long hair.  </li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t perfect as far as no knots but a lot better than a standard brush and works well on my 5 year old&#x27;s long wavy hair.</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t hurt as much because it only brushes the top layer of hair!  </li>
            <li> We had ordered the Teeny Genie and got this, which is a behemoth-sized palm fit, so the Littles can&#x27;t hold it very well, and it&#x27;s even large for my hand.  </li>
            <li> She first tried it right after school yesterday.</li>
            <li> So easy to brush my 2 year old granddaughters hair</li>
            <li> Works great on wet hair helping my 7 year old comb her hair and avoid knots.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend for everyone who has hair that tangles easily, or who have sensitive scalps.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy for a child or adult to hold and use.</li>
            <li> Huge bonus that it&#x27;s pink because that is her favorite color.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much, I bought a second one - one for upstairs, one for downstairs.  </li>
            <li> No more tears at bath time any more!!  </li>
            <li> This brush is fantastic for one of my grand nieces who has very fine thin hair.  </li>
            <li> My granddaughters are always complaining when I want to brush their hair but this brush is great!&lt;br /&gt;It gets the tangles out very gently.</li>
            <li> Most brushes hurt and make my hair frizzier, this does not hurt, is easy to use and cuts down on the frizz too.</li>
            <li> This really works!  </li>
            <li> She says that she likes it better than her regular brush</li>
            <li> While this does better than a regular brush if they have ANY sort of curl or thickness to their hair</li>
            <li> However, there are some things most fathers simply do not know,...</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say its a &amp;#34;magical&amp;#34; brush like they imply, but it does work a lot better than any standard girls hairbrush.</li>
            <li> My first grade child always complains when I try to brush her hair.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find it to work any better than a regular brush &amp; I returned it.</li>
            <li> So much easier mornings!</li>
            <li> Better than a regular brush</li>
            <li> and I both love it, and my niece who is 8, no longer cries when her hip length hair gets brushed after a shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Knot Genie when it first came out.  </li>
            <li> but it works so well that I am willing to put up with the inconvenience.  </li>
            <li> Got this for my grand daughter who hates her hair brushed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a fantastic brush!</li>
            <li> This brush does exactly what it promises.</li>
            <li> She used to scream when we brushed her hair, but with this brush, she never complains and it has made bathtime in our house much more relaxed.</li>
            <li> Sadly, no.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s better than a traditional brush</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> One stroke brushes the top, middle and bottom of hair.</li>
            <li> The Knot Genie was exactly what is shown in the image and works as said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now she is willing to let even daddy brush her hair.</li>
            <li> works pretty well.</li>
            <li> This is the first product I&#x27;ve been able to use on my middle child&#x27;s hair that allows me to comb from root to tip.  </li>
            <li> however it&#x27;s better than a standard brush.</li>
            <li> it does work better than a standard brush though.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 12 and for 11 years we have fought over brushing her curly hair (uh, she was bald for the first year).</li>
            <li> Truth be told, I occasionally use it for my beard as well :)</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s what I bought it for &amp; that&#x27;s exactly what it does.</li>
            <li> But what do you know, it works exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Be aware, this is a junk brush.</li>
            <li> The knot genie only detangled the top layer of hair, leaving a rats nest beneath.  </li>
            <li> The first one  lasted me for about a year.</li>
            <li> I personally didn&#x27;t think it did any better at getting knots out without pain.</li>
            <li> I ended up not being able to use it on my child&#x27;s hair because it&#x27;s curly and just made her hair one big pouf</li>
            <li> Would definitly recommend for straight hair!</li>
            <li> A regular brush and a wider tooth comb would have been a better investment for us.</li>
            <li> It really, really works!</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think it would be any better cut short.</li>
            <li> This is the only brush that works on my daughter&#x27;s super fine tangled hair.</li>
            <li> First of all we ordered this one thinking</li>
            <li> With the knot genie, we are able to brush her hair almost daily (sometimes even twice a day!).</li>
            <li> I bought this brush some time ago in the hopes that it would brush through my 5 year old daughter&#x27;s hair smoothly.  </li>
            <li> So well in fact, that her first one disappeared to someone else&#x27;s home.</li>
            <li> This brush really does work!</li>
            <li> When they tried it, they both said it took the knots out better than a regular brush, but it still hurt when they used it.</li>
            <li> I feel a regular detangling brush from Target worked better.</li>
            <li> If your child runs screaming every time you take a brush out, this is exactly what you need.</li>
            <li> When it first arrives, have patience with it and your child.</li>
            <li> Kids willingly use it.  </li>
            <li> I got this brush for my daughter for Christmas and she likes it much better than traditional brushes!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did not buy te bigger one.</li>
            <li> I saw this product, for the first time, in Parents Magazine.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not the first time this has happened</li>
            <li> and it works much better than any regular brush I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> color is pretty</li>
            <li> I brush my children&#x27;s hair with this first to get most of the knots out then the regular brush to finish up.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting several more so that we can have them with us all the time.  </li>
            <li> When I used this the first time in her hair, the brush got stuck within the knot</li>
            <li> My granddaughter has long very fine hair that snarls and tangles in the slightest breeze.  </li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is long and very fine, with layers.  </li>
            <li> My 10 year old also like to use it on her hair (much thicker but still easily tangled during sleep), when she can pry it away from her sister.</li>
            <li> My daughter hates having her hair brushed she has a very sensitive scalp and this brush is amazing</li>
            <li> It also can scratch the scalp easily if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> She only wants to use this brush since she thinks it&#x27;s magic, but the regular brush worked better.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this for my 5-1/2 yr old girl after having read the reviews.</li>
            <li> About a month ago, hair brushing started becoming a challenge because of the tangles, even when we used a detangler and brushed very gently.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use,I only wish they had a kettle bell type handle or a long handle on it for easy holding.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use,I only wish they had a kettle bell type handle or a long handle on it for easy holding.</li>
            <li> You can still store clips and bobby pins inside, which is super helpful, but they made the bristles more rigid and almost sharp than before.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has really long, fine hair &amp; a lot of it!  </li>
            <li> However, because my hair is curly, I would not use this brush regularly as ANY brush causes my hair to frizz more (even though I dry it with a bonnet type of dryer and leave in most of the conditioner).  </li>
            <li> Finally, this product is built from what appears to be 10 cents worth of cheap plastic.  </li>
            <li> You still have to be gentle with it, but it is better than a traditional brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s okay simply because my daughter didn&#x27;t fight me as much when I used this brush.  </li>
            <li> She claims it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much and will sometimes look back to make sure this is the brush</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really remove knots any better than a regular comb would do for us.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has very fine, long, straight hair.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has thicker, but very straight hair that gets really tangled.  </li>
            <li> My young daughter has fine, long hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li> Both my grand nieces have long hair.</li>
            <li> MORE TEARS brushing her long hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Also, for you curly girls, we pair this with AG Fast Food leave-in hair conditioner and it helps keep those knots from forming in the first place.</li>
            <li> This is the first real brush I have used on her hair</li>
            <li> It was pretty much life-changing.  </li>
            <li> We were looking for something to brush my daughters long hair and this isn&#x27;t any better than the brushes we already had.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s slightly better in terms of hair pulling, however, the bristles on this hairbrush are very short, so maybe it doesn&#x27;t pull as much b/c it&#x27;s not brushing through as much?  </li>
            <li> My young daughter has had to have her hair cut short as it gets tangled very easily.</li>
            <li> while this brush doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as a regular hair brush on first &amp;#34;swipe&amp;#34;, it also doesn&#x27;t really get out the knots as easily either.  </li>
            <li> My 5 yr old has the most beautiful THICK LONG CURLY hair.</li>
            <li> Due to this, she gets tangles very easily.  </li>
            <li> and then when I got it the bristles seemed very short and easy to break</li>
            <li> My daughters have relatively straight hair, one with somewhat coarse hair and another with pretty fine hair.</li>
            <li> It comes apart in two pieces, but even my daughter can get it back together again easily.</li>
            <li> Have not used anyother brush on my 8yr old with Ld &amp; SENSORY.&lt;br /&gt;THE SUPER BRUSH---</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re flexible, so I thought there was no way they would be strong enough to work through her hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s large brushing surface area.</li>
            <li> It still hurts my daughter to brush out the large tangles, but it works well otherwise.</li>
            <li> The brush is too large for a child to hold as well.</li>
            <li> Prior to discovering the Knot Genie, my daughter would burst into tears every time I brushed her hair because her hair is extremely fine and gets easily tangled.</li>
            <li> Works great on wet hair but does tend to break dry hair.</li>
            <li> I only use it on the bottom parts of her hair, which is fine because that&#x27;s where all the tangles are anyway.</li>
            <li> She has baby fine hair with a medium curl that tangles on the back of her head, where her head touches the bed when she sleeps.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks now and let me tell you, my daughter is quick to tell you no other brush is going to touch her hair!  </li>
            <li> one straight, one finer and wavy).  </li>
            <li> This brush really delivers.</li>
            <li> I would really like to know who all these people touting its miracle powers are...</li>
            <li> I have found that I do need to be gentle or the teeth can hurt my daughter&#x27;s head.  </li>
            <li> but it works really well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a very therapeutic brush.</li>
            <li> My 4 year wants hair like Rapunzel and it gets in knots.  </li>
            <li> No tangling; glides straight through.</li>
            <li> then after a couple days not so much...</li>
            <li> , it won&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> I have straight hair and this brush worked wonders.</li>
            <li> but WE know who it was REALLY created for.  </li>
            <li> my youngest daughter has very curly hair, and it is always a battle to get her to let me even attempt to comb it.  </li>
            <li> She LOVES it ( she is 7 now) and covets the thing so much</li>
            <li> -(&lt;br /&gt;She says it pulls her hair too much and hurts.</li>
            <li> The brush is very flimsy and doesn&#x27;t work as advertised.</li>
            <li> Very useful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle.  </li>
            <li> and this really helps.</li>
            <li> It is fast and gets the knots out without hurting her.</li>
            <li> This product was highly recommended by a patient and a pharmaceuticals rep at my workplace, when I had expressed my issue about my daughter&#x27;s hair being so curly and unruly!</li>
            <li> It really does get through the tangles easier than a brush with nobs and hooks at the ends.</li>
            <li> My daughter never fights me when I use this brush and she even wants to herself now</li>
            <li> I expected something that would work better than a brush.</li>
            <li> Love the Fairy Pink detangling brush.  </li>
            <li> Forget about brushing through wet hair, it won&#x27;t, tried it after bath time thinking maybe that was when we would see the magic happen.</li>
            <li> The detangling process is very time consuming and accompanied by tears and screaming.  </li>
            <li> Give it a try if you dread hair combing as much as I used to.</li>
            <li> My daughter really dislikes this brush.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really work that well my hair or my daughter&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really compare.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that wants to form ringlets and twists all the time and can get all tangled up.</li>
            <li> I tried this because my daughter (and myself) have curly and very tangled hair.  </li>
            <li> We didn&#x27;t really care if it took out tangles, as it hurt our heads too much to use anyway.  </li>
            <li> But all in all the brush really helps.</li>
            <li> My daughter doesn&#x27;t complain as much when I brush out the tangles with it either.</li>
            <li> My daughter (10 months) has very curly hair that gets very matted after sleeping on it and washing it.</li>
            <li> The know genie works without detangling spray, takes 3-4 minutes to do her whole head, and makes her hair much smoother.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has very think curly hair and brushing is a struggle.</li>
            <li> and I was hoping this brush would make getting tangles out much easier.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This thing really works.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li> You just have to be patient and keep gently brushing the hair, eventually the knots all work out.</li>
            <li> Her hair is straight, about medium thickness and the length of her shoulder blades.</li>
            <li> Maybe I was expecting too much from it, but I doubt I&#x27;d recommend it to friends or family from my experience.</li>
            <li> really fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair gets very tangled, and was a struggle every morning to brush it out.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Wet Brush after purchasing this one and it works so much better.</li>
            <li> Knot Genie gently detangles without pulling.  </li>
            <li> They come out eventually, but with a lot of distraction and gentle work.</li>
            <li> This brush really does get the tangles out without pulling hair.  </li>
            <li> You still have to be gentle, and work through the knots, but it doesn&#x27;t yank and hurt the scalp.</li>
            <li> My hair feels and looks so much softer now.</li>
            <li> There is still some annoyance with tangles, but a couple of swipes through the hair and they are gone - much quicker than the comb or brush.</li>
            <li> and she absolutely loves using this brush.</li>
            <li> My daughter is very tender headed and has always fought me brushing her hair.  </li>
            <li> Was really looking forward  to something that could handle my daughter&#x27;s waist length hair.</li>
            <li> As a dad trying to help her get ready in the morning</li>
            <li> She used to CRY every time I tried to brush or comb it because it hurt so much.  </li>
            <li> but it really needs a handle.</li>
            <li> My daughter absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> It is not perfect, but it by far the best item on the market for brushing children&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> The unexpected side benefit is that the brush does such a good job that my kids&#x27; blonde hair looks even blonder.</li>
            <li> good old fashioned comb works way better than this expensive thing.</li>
            <li> My 2 1/2 year old daughter has long, very fine hair which is always tangled.</li>
            <li> My 3-year old has very fine, long hair.  </li>
            <li> Very good, after washing hair or wet hair when using this comb, hair loss, decreased significantly.</li>
            <li> It literally glides right through her hair with complete ease.</li>
            <li> Not as great as i expected based on other&#x27;s feedback</li>
            <li> on wet hair, it did a better job, but only if I added detangler spray to it and to be honest, a normal brush would have done the same job then</li>
            <li> She has long fine straight hair</li>
            <li> One of the best brushes I have found that works with my long, thin, straight hair that gets tangled.</li>
            <li> However it&#x27;s much better than the other brushes we were using.</li>
            <li> Other than that, we love it.</li>
            <li> It also creates static due to the plastic bristles.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work any better than any other brush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> So, if that scene sounds at all familiar to you, you should totally try this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works so much better than any other comb or brush I have tried.  </li>
            <li> oh well, now I&#x27;ve got an extra one for me to use until the original one shows up again.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is any better than any other brush.</li>
            <li> Better than other brushes but no miracle brush.</li>
            <li> But ever she says she likes this brush much better than any other.</li>
            <li> While I had high hopes for this brush, it just does not do the trick on my daughter&#x27;s superfine blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> Fine, spiderweb hair easily tangles, and breaks if pulled too hard.  </li>
            <li> It feels like the plastic is cheaply made and is pretty rough on my daughter&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> and she didn&#x27;t have a fit, unlike when I brushed her hair with a normal brush at home.</li>
            <li> She loves this brush, barely complains any more about having her hair brushed.</li>
            <li> Great brush for fussy little girl with long hair!</li>
            <li> I am still surprised how this brush got so many good reviews, when for me and my two friends it&#x27;s worse than a regular brush.</li>
            <li> Call it part placebo effect - she has a &amp;#34;special pink brush&amp;#34; now, but it definitely detangles more gently and effectively than other brushes.</li>
            <li> I found out about Knot Genie 2 years ago, i already had a light blue one but decided to get a new color.</li>
            <li> She has very long, fine hair, and brushing always brought tears to both of our eyes.  </li>
            <li> Ultimately, we have found more success with a product called &amp;#34;the wet brush&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I first found this brush when I took my 3 year old for a hair cut.</li>
            <li> This is almost exactly like the brush the hospital sent home with us when my daughter was born (except not as soft).  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t banish all knots (only a true genie could do that)</li>
            <li> It feels very cheap and more like a fake doll brush than something you&#x27;d want to use on your kid.</li>
            <li> (my husband even thought it was a new cat brush when he saw it on the counter!).  </li>
            <li> The only plus I see is that the bristles are so flexible that they bend instead of breaking the hair once they hit the knots (thought the sound is pretty much the same, which I can&#x27;t stand).</li>
            <li> Works great but its big, hard to hold in my hand and there is no way a child could do</li>
            <li> It is amazing especially when used on wet hair.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this, my four year old niece cries a good deal less while getting her hair brushed.</li>
            <li> it will not go thru wet hair easily, and hurts in the process.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> My 3 year old daughter has long fine hair that gets very tangled during bathtime.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s easy to take apart and empty out.</li>
            <li> I will admit, it took some getting used to initially because the bristles are more &amp;#34;sharp and pointy&amp;#34; feeling than regular brushes.</li>
            <li> Plus her older brothers kept stealing hers.  </li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s very comfortable using this little bug.</li>
            <li> I brush from the very top down, holding the bristles against her head and back.  </li>
            <li> It feels to me like it takes a lot more work to actually get her hair snarl free, but maybe not, since she&#x27;ll usually lets me use this brush on her and will try and hide from the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this detangling brush for curlier hair.</li>
            <li> quality item that I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for children.</li>
            <li> Also the price is  too high for this brush.</li>
            <li> highly recommend .</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Do yourself and your child a favor, buy one of these brushes, I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended it, and I didn&#x27;t have high hopes, but it works miracles.</li>
            <li> I bought this in combination with Organic Sprout Miracle Detangler which I also highly recommend.</li>
            <li> highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe that her hair was really truly brushed out that easily, so I followed up with my regular brush just to check.  </li>
            <li> The individual bristles are SHARP and kind of raked over my scalp.  </li>
            <li> Better than an average brush!  </li>
            <li> Would be a little more convenient if it had a handle of some sort.</li>
            <li> I have 3 girls ranging in age from 5 to 11 yrs old and ALL three rave about this brush!!</li>
            <li> It fits my daugher&#x27;s adorable and smallish little hand.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a 7 year old grand-daughter with that baby fine waist long hair.</li>
            <li> Works well but kind of hard to hold on to</li>
            <li> My three year old has very long, fine hair</li>
            <li> It is always a struggle when it comes to brushing my 7 year old daughters hair but this product has made the process go much smoother.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my 3 year old who is very tender and hates having hair messed with.  </li>
            <li> But as far as just getting the tangles out beforehand, this works really well.</li>
            <li> From the brushER side, the Knot Genie has better potential, but from the brushEE side, my girls and I prefer the Hair Bean, by a long shot.  </li>
            <li> so I could see if it would be worth it to try on my daughter when she has enough hair to use it.  </li>
            <li> So I bought a few more on Amazon.</li>
            <li> She has thin, fine hair that gets tangled easily.</li>
            <li> a few more to have on hand.</li>
            <li> It would normally take me 4-5 minutes to brush it to where it was tangle-free.</li>
            <li> you can get a nice wooden one for the same price at a local beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> My older daughter has shoulder length wavy fine hair and my younger daughter has fine but thick and straight shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> Wanted to try it for a few weeks just to be sure, and know what?</li>
            <li> best detangling solution is using a small amount of Chi silk serum in wet hair or J&amp;J detangling spray in dry hair.</li>
            <li> We love it as no other brush, comb or other even came close.</li>
            <li> i received this brush in the mail, I tried using it like a regular brush, expecting it to pull through the tangles right away.  </li>
            <li> Virtually the only time I can get a comb or brush through it is right after washing and conditioning it.  </li>
            <li> In addition to it brushing through the knotty mess, it left her hair smooth and super shiny.</li>
            <li> , it is sort of small, and a bit hard for me to hold onto, and I frequently drop it while trying to comb her hair, but she can  hold it and do it herself perfectly</li>
            <li> Not very impressed with this brush, cheap &amp; cheaply made.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t move through the large knots as well, but for general brushing it works well!  </li>
            <li> Also I realize how desperate I must&#x27;ve been becuase the thing is not worth more than a McDonalds Happy Meal toy.</li>
            <li> With this brush, we still use a little detangling spray, and then she can actually brush her own hair.  </li>
            <li> We are also able to brush her hair with little or no crying.</li>
            <li> It does detangle more gently than a regular brush, but it&#x27;s not worth your money.</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and purchased a more expensive brush, honestly, it was worth the price!</li>
            <li> Perhaps, someday, a new brush will be designed that truly does end the days of hair brushing tears, but this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> so I was so hoping that this brush would live up to it&#x27;s name.  </li>
            <li> i wanted a new one.</li>
            <li> With our new brush we get through it in 1/2 the time with no tears.</li>
            <li> Not anymore with this new brush.  </li>
            <li> She has shorter straight hair that really doesn&#x27;t even tangle much, but if I try to use it on her hair dry</li>
            <li> she and her sister take turns brushing each other&#x27;s hair works just as expected and better!</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my daughter who has VERY curly hair and absolutely hates getting her hair brushed.</li>
            <li> my girls love pink, and it&#x27;s something different for them.  </li>
            <li> (I have very thick fine hair that is four inches past my shoulder) as I have borrowed my daughters&#x27; and find it way more effective than the wide tooth comb I normally use.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d let a very young child use this without supervision</li>
            <li> highly recommend this knot genie,saves me a lot of time on busy mornings.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this knot genie,saves me a lot of time on busy mornings.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t flexible and the bristles aren&#x27;t very soft.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it for little ones with fine hair.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t do any better job than an ordinary brush and if anything I feel it is rougher, her hair always friezes up when I use it and looks like I am causing breakage.</li>
            <li> First this , then brush the ends with a regular brush, then this again.</li>
            <li> , she won&#x27;t even let her 3 siblings near it!</li>
            <li> No more tears from my 5yo when brushing the tangles out :)</li>
            <li> Pretty simple design.</li>
            <li> My Granddaughters just love it; no more fighting with their hair their mom&#x27;s tell me.  </li>
            <li> At first she and her sister didn&#x27;t scream when I brushed their hair with it</li>
            <li> I am so surprised!</li>
            <li> my four year old doesn&#x27;t cry in pain when brushing her hair!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it when I brushed her hair for the first time with Knot Genie, and she didn&#x27;t complain AT ALL.  </li>
            <li> My son even likes to use it because it&#x27;s so soft!  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> It is honestly the only way I can get through my daughters thick, straight hair without a lot of tears and drama.</li>
            <li> Nothing special,  this is just a regular brush, no more science involve, you can find better or same quality in any store.</li>
            <li> However, they have not complained more or less with these (than they do with regular hair brushes).</li>
            <li> It literally killed the beautiful waves she had in her long mid back length hair.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t fit &amp;#34;nicely&amp;#34; in your hand &amp; pretty hard bristles.</li>
            <li> I am happy to report - no, I&#x27;m ecstatic to report that crying, tangles and pulling on their hair for an eternity is now in our past.</li>
            <li> my daughter has superfine slightly curly hair.</li>
            <li> I drop it way too often and end up switching back to my daughter&#x27;s regular brush/comb but its not a bad product just could use improvement.</li>
            <li> Works great on our little girls sensitive hair, no more tears to brush hair.</li>
            <li> My little girl has shoulder length hair and is on fine.  </li>
            <li> No crying or running away by my curly-haired two year old!  </li>
            <li> Developed by an American mother of three tangle haired daughters with traumatizing childhood memories of her own tangled hair issues, the secret is the different lengths of teeth on the brush, which  bend just right to gently untangle hair.  </li>
            <li> better to work(using this brush to detangle) on dry hair than wet</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve used it on dry and wet hair and we literally don&#x27;t have any more screaming or tears while brushing hair.</li>
            <li> have to say that the knot genie appears to work better on dry hair rather than wet hair.</li>
            <li> The bristles are stiff and don&#x27;t easily move.</li>
            <li> It only brushes the top layer and everything underneath is still a tangled mess.  </li>
            <li> I originally purchased to try one on myself before my daughter had long enough hair to brush</li>
            <li> And then, when they or I drop it - because is it slippery, and too large to hold well, it comes apart and needs to be popped back together.</li>
            <li> in all, while it&#x27;s not perfect, my daughter generally will let me use the &amp;#34;special brush&amp;#34; on her and that alone is worth a lot! :)</li>
            <li> I am sure it is intentional, to help with thick or long hair, but just be aware of this if you have a sensitive child!</li>
            <li> Brush\\&quot; a much smaller version of the original, which can be purchased for whole $4 less.</li>
            <li> My four year old daughter did not say ouch once the whole time I brushed her hair.</li>
            <li> While the name of this item clearly states: \\&quot;Knot Genie Detangling</li>
            <li> My eight-year-old daughter has been using the Knot Genie Detangling brush since early last year and absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> The hair underneath is still tangled and can only be reached by brushing the hair in sections- very time consuming.</li>
            <li> She also doesn&#x27;t complain as much when we use this brush vs a regular comb.</li>
            <li> Brushing hair after bathtime has been my least favorite time of the day for awhile.  </li>
            <li> Can also be used for adult hair that is below the shoulders.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush for my 3 year old granddaughter.  </li>
            <li> titular web site claims that they \\&quot;were created for every mom that&#x27;s endured the foot stomping and screaming matches that come with brushing their child&#x27;s hair,\\&quot;</li>
            <li> We have issues when it comes to brushing my 2 year old hair.  </li>
            <li> Having to fight my daughter to brush her hair daily is very tiring.</li>
            <li> no crying or screaming at me that it hurt.</li>
            <li> It slid through her hair much easier than any traditional brush</li>
            <li> I bought 3 of these so far.</li>
            <li> When brushing, the bristles will bend to slide over the knot making the brush completely ineffective.</li>
            <li> Instead of spending several minutes spraying tons of detangler and trying to gently comb out knots, I am done in like 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> My adult daughter</li>
            <li> I have 3 young granddaughters.  </li>
            <li> My two year old</li>
            <li> absolutely hates to have her hair brushed.</li>
            <li> What took 1-2 minutes to brush, I can now complete in seconds.</li>
            <li> This brush is gentle enough for her not to scream and yet still gets the knots out of her hair.</li>
            <li> But kids really like them and that alone is a big help.</li>
            <li> This brush would probably rate 5 stars if an adult were using it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is, but my 5 year old gets some gnarly tangles in her hair.  </li>
            <li> Wow, what a difference a hair brush can make- literally no tears, no crying,</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 5-yr old for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Bought for our 3 year old Granddaughter, I thought it would help in detangling her hair.  </li>
            <li> I also have an 18 month old and she lets me use this on her with no problem.</li>
            <li> no crying</li>
            <li> I really do think the brush works though, because we recently left it at a hotel</li>
            <li> No matter how gentle we&#x27;ve been, it was just not enough, until now.  </li>
            <li> My daughter is mixed so her hair is very curly.</li>
            <li> My daughter wants to try to the one currently being shown on TV in commercials</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 4 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this because my five year old daughter would literally run off when I tried to brush or comb her hair.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair soft, shiny and no hair in the brush afterward.</li>
            <li> Use this brush for our 8 and 4 year old girls.  </li>
            <li> son has longer-than-average hair and would wince and complain any time a hairbrush even came near him.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve purchased three Knot Genies so far - one for home, one for the car and one for my daughter&#x27;s school bag.</li>
            <li> she&#x27;s always recommending it to young cousins and friends.  </li>
            <li> My two-year old girls let me brush their hair with it, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to pull.</li>
            <li> Well, I should say her 7-yr old brother tried it on her yesterday</li>
            <li> and she nearly screamed her lungs out.</li>
            <li> So I bought this for my 3 yo curly head daughter who absolutely hates to get her hair brushed.</li>
            <li> WOW..</li>
            <li> When her hair is wet and freshly conditioned it works</li>
            <li> This brush is the one she is willing to use to brush her hair out, and she doesn&#x27;t seem to complain about the knots as much as she does when using other brushes!</li>
            <li> There are no little rounded tips on the bristles, so my children complain if this runs over their ears and neck - which is frequently, give</li>
            <li> She cried more than usual when I tried to brush her hair with it!</li>
            <li> This is small and easy, fits in the palm of her hand</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the first brush I&#x27;ve used on my daughter&#x27;s hair that can detangle dry hair.</li>
            <li> I tried it right on a tangled spot on her DRY hair and to my amazement there was no pulling!!  </li>
            <li> I tried starting from the bottom like a regular brush, I tried starting from the top and brushing straight down like one reviewer recommended.</li>
            <li> old is a crazy sleeper and her hair is so fine it gets knots quite easily.</li>
            <li> I have long, wavy, super thick hair that is pretty much a recipe for disaster when it comes to tangles.</li>
            <li> Her hair is very thick and tangles very easily.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This may be an okay brush if there arent serious tangles to deal with</li>
            <li> I decided to finally contact the manufacturer and make them aware of a possible defect.  </li>
            <li> My 3 year old had long hair and we got this to help get the knots out without too much tugging.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are pretty sharp, so you just have to be sure not to press too hard when you brush.  </li>
            <li> It works right through knotted baby fine hair with little or no trauma to the little girls.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull through very well, and it just doesn&#x27;t seem to be any better than any other inexpensive brush I&#x27;ve tried on her in the past - and I feel like I have tried them all.  </li>
            <li> Got two of these last year, one for each of my granddaughters, one with very fine hair and one thick and curly.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for these especially since they are $20.00 per brush.</li>
            <li> so well,yes it will take a little getting use to how to brush your hair with it ,Most people do not treat there hair right, so i think learning that to the people that have bad experiances with it cause it has been so much better with it,</li>
            <li> Our little girl has thick, long hair and is always complaining when we brush it, but this brush does seem to go through her hair much more easily that the others.  </li>
            <li> It tangles very easily, and I am pretty sure she somehow does gymnastics in bed, and she wakes up with nasty hair.</li>
            <li> The only down side of this is that the brush part and the pink backing can come apart fairly easily if dropped but it pops right back on.</li>
            <li> So, I tried it out on my long curly hair and it really did work wonders.</li>
            <li> My daughter has long wavy hair and it gets very tangled up.</li>
            <li> I. I have long straight hair and my daughter has curly medium length hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter can easily fit it in her hand, and it&#x27;s not too small to get lost in mine or my husband&#x27;s hand.</li>
            <li> I am sure it works for some bit was not good for my daughters curly hair</li>
            <li> and my hair is back to normal.</li>
            <li> Service was prompt and exactly waht I expected</li>
            <li> Works good a little hard to hold onto.</li>
            <li> Works quickly and causes little to no pain.</li>
            <li> It separates snags and tangles quickly and with little fuss.</li>
            <li> It hurt more than a regular brush which actually never hurt me since I have a pretty tough scalp.</li>
            <li> small little brush for the detangled hair, Quality is very cheap for the price though !</li>
            <li> She still doesn&#x27;t like it because it has hard bristles, but it&#x27;s a much better alternative to regular brushes or combs.</li>
            <li> Wish I new about this brush earlier.</li>
            <li> Camoflage]] is available, but no Hunter&#x27;s Orange, at least not so far.</li>
            <li> However, she wants to use it on dry hair as well.  </li>
            <li> sensitive scalp,hold the hair in your hand away from skin as much as possible.&lt;br /&gt;7.For a finishing touch,can use a wide tooth comb after brushing with knot genie.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter has curly hair and this brush did absolutely nothing different than a regular brush would do.</li>
            <li> The second I opened the package, I decided to put it to the ultimate test and brush my daughter&#x27;s hair after she had been at school the whole day.</li>
            <li> Every morning I spent 10-15 minutes trying to detangle my 7 year old&#x27;s shoulder length straight hair ,which gets all matted and knotted after sleep.</li>
            <li> Thick hair requires brushing top and underside of hair as prickles are too short to go thru hair.</li>
            <li> Essentially the same as the Hair Bean (long and short plastic bristles to really get the tangles out), except this one has stiffer bristles, which gives a little more oomph, but also makes it scratchier.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my 4 year old daughter, she has long hair and she will play with it creating large knots in the back of her head.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> She has a very sensitive head and hates tangles being brushed out.  </li>
            <li> so i would literally have to hold the top (pink part) together with the black (brush part)!</li>
            <li> It is also great for making ponytails as the brush has a slight curve for a wider base to gather hair and get it smooth.</li>
            <li> This little brush is worth every stinkin&#x27; penny.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money and a must-have for any household with little girls.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly hair and my stylist used this on me before my latest wash and cut.</li>
            <li> I initially thought that the bristles might be a little rough, but I tried it on my 2 year old anyway and was surprised at how quickly it worked!</li>
            <li> They are cheap plastic and the bristles are hard and hurt.</li>
            <li> : This product will obviously also work on male hair for males with hair long enough for tangling to be an issue, but the color scheme most men would be willing to be caught dead with is a bit limited.  </li>
            <li> Camoflage]] is available, but no Hunter&#x27;s Orange, at least not so far.t will obviously also work on male hair for males with hair long enough for tangling to be an issue, but the color scheme most men would be willing to be caught dead with is a bit limited.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fine for her hand, which means it&#x27;s too small for mine!</li>
            <li> In general, it slides through her &amp;#34;rat&#x27;s nest&amp;#34; with ease.</li>
            <li> Made of cheap plastic and works no better than a regular comb or brush.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see it being very durable or long lasting (speculation) nor do I see it justifying the $10 to $15 price</li>
            <li> My 3 year old has long, naturally wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 2 1/2 year old daughters fuzzy morning and after nap hair, just the fuzzies on the back of her head.</li>
            <li> My 18 month old daughter gets rats in the back of hair every once in a while.</li>
            <li> My squirmy three year old hates sitting still to have her hair brushed, so I always dreaded that chore.</li>
            <li> Works very well with wet hair.</li>
            <li> Daily hair brushing is a nightmare for my almost 4 year old.</li>
            <li> My daughter inherited my sensitive scalp, and always makes a fuss about having her hair brushed, so my mother-in-law sent us one of these.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also a mom of two girls with extra sensitive scalps.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old daughter hates having her hair brushed.  </li>
            <li> Overall a good purchase for my 3 year old with crazy curly hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter has medium thick hair and the bristles aren&#x27;t strong enough to get the knots out.</li>
            <li> daughter has very long hair which tangles easily, and has always disliked having her hair brushed.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and thought I need to give it a try, since most comments were positive.. trying this on dry hair totally failed..</li>
            <li> The Knot Genie slides right through their hair whether it be wet or dry.</li>
            <li> With my girls I used to pull the side braids together at the back and secure with a small elastic and pull the back braids over before undoing them.</li>
            <li> If your child has thick hair, work in small sections by separating the hair and use a good detangling spray or leave in conditioner if the hair is extra tangled.</li>
            <li> The model who has straight, shiny conditioned or oiled THIN STRAIGHT hair that the brush is slipping right through.so</li>
            <li> The bristles are a hard, very pointy plastic and no matter how gently we use it, my daughter cries.</li>
            <li> I find that it works particularly well when her hair is wet.</li>
            <li> Does a  really good job quickly detangling my three daughters&#x27; hair, which ranges from thick and curly to fine and awfully tangly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been so surprised to get a bad product after reading such good reviews about it.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and so does my 5 year old.</li>
            <li> We have no more hair pulling drama with our toddler, and that makes it worth it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the first time she used a brush that didn&#x27;t pull out her fluffy hair</li>
            <li> The construction of this product is average, this size of the product fits in a large hand but is manageable for smaller hands.</li>
            <li> Fathers and daughters share a special bond, part of which is based upon the (initial at least) belief by daughters that their fathers can fix anything and by their fathers&#x27; willingness to walk through a wall of fire rather than disappoint them.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to get this product because my 6 year old daughter has very easily-tangled hair, and I was desperate for anything that wouldn&#x27;t make her burst into tears while using.  </li>
            <li> My 4 year old has very long hair</li>
            <li> My hair is straight and tangles much less</li>
            <li> My 4 year old daughter hates getting her long hair brushed after baths.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for super thick and course hair</li>
            <li> I have used detangler sprays before but this brush detangled easily in just a few seconds no spray and little effort.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s this odd shape, which makes it ok for adults, but hard for my kids (2 and 4) to hold and brush by themselves.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first with some of the reviews; after years of fighting with my girls hair who wouldn&#x27;t be, right?  </li>
            <li> B0074AR8UY Knot Genie Detangling Brush]] is made in a ridiculous number of colors and two different sizes: the original and the 20% smaller</li>
            <li> That being said, I do love the product and my daughter is already happier about having her hair brushed so the positive outweighs the bad.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my little girl, who doesn&#x27;t have much hair yet.</li>
            <li> We have several older Knot Genie brushes that had worn down over time.  </li>
            <li> For parents of very young kids: the bristles on the brush are reasonably sharp</li>
            <li> Her tangles get to be pretty matted down, but this brush worked absolutely no miracles for us.  </li>
            <li> I tried it on my 3 year old who has long thin hair that gets knotted easily when wet.</li>
            <li> However, it would not budge my other grand niece&#x27;s hair which is very thick.  </li>
            <li> She is 5 and has long thin hair that gets easily tangled during the day and during sleep.  </li>
            <li> Super-sensitive head of the older Little STILL does not like to get hair brushed, so I see no benefit.  </li>
            <li> My two year old doesn&#x27;t have hair that gets extremely tangled, but she hates having it brushed.  </li>
            <li> Not exactly a miracle for my 4 year old, but it has definitely helped.  </li>
            <li> This works fabulous on my long, thick, wavy hair!</li>
            <li> It is also rather large, it felt uncomfortable in my normal adult hand, I would recommend the teeny version for children.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but willing to try anything as brushing my 5 year old daughter&#x27;s hair had turned into a 15 minute process of detangling spray and section by section brushing with a soft bristle brush.  </li>
            <li> it will turn back up sometime,  but until then I had to get another one because going back to a regular brush for my girls long wavy hair wasn&#x27;t working out</li>
            <li> /&gt;Worse, as luck would have it, the obvious solution, which involves the use of scissors, is not generally considered acceptable by daughters OR by their mothers.  </li>
            <li> She has soft, medium-thick, and wavy hair down to the middle of her back.  </li>
            <li> My only regret is not finding out about this sooner and using standard combs for so long.</li>
            <li> I recommend this brush to everyone I know with a little girl and have started to ordered it as a present for a new baby girl.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got a little girl with fine hair, I suggest you at least try this brush.  </li>
            <li> Absolute waste!</li>
            <li> With the Knot Genie the bristles arent long enough to go thru all of her hair.</li>
            <li> My only regret is that I waited this long to purchase this brush......</li>
            <li> Probably wont last long.</li>
            <li> This worked like a charm to get through them without the pulling and extra long time efforts it took to brush her hair.</li>
            <li> Normally, I have to pull and tug at messy, knotty hair in order to brush it after a shower.</li>
            <li> This brush works pretty well on my girl with medium thick hair.</li>
            <li> My 3 yr old daughter has hair down to her bottom.</li>
            <li> He pulled it out and showed me that if you continuously, yet softly, keep brushing down the hair, the knots eventually work themselves to the bottom and out.  </li>
            <li> As far as less pain?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awkward to hold and really only gets to the top layer of hair.  </li>
            <li> This initially bothered her sensitive scalp some, but after a few days she was thanking me for buying his brush.</li>
            <li> This method, plus a regular brush, starting from the bottom up and carefully detangling the tangles, works just as well as this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter has very corse thick hair and this brush actually works to detangle it without making her scream and cry.</li>
            <li> then my old perm comb with the wide teeth then use a smaller comb then fix or pull up or leave down</li>
            <li> My daughter (almost 3) has super thin, long hair that tangles at the drop of a hat.</li>
            <li> have 3 children, 10 year old with thin hair and a very sensitive scalp, a 3 year old son with short hair and a 2 year old daughter with long thick hair.</li>
            <li> My 9 year old daughter says its still pulls her hair a little bit</li>
            <li> But really it is just a small negative, as I can&#x27;t live without it now!</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t really have hard hair to brush</li>
            <li> My 5 year old have almost waist-length, thick, relatively straight with a little bit of curl on the ends-kind of hair.  </li>
            <li> and my daughter hates it  complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> use it to comb my long hair everyday.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Two girls and long hair?</li>
            <li> The item arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Works well on long haired dogs</li>
            <li> When i bought it my daughter had long curly hair</li>
            <li> The reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because there was a long period of time where she would say &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t want that one&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> She is 4 and has really long hair and took no time to brush through it all.</li>
            <li> I purchased a pink knot genie and also a blue one for my daughter and</li>
            <li> Completely not functional as a brush.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 3yo niece who has long tangle-prone hair.</li>
            <li> I use it when my daughters hair is wet only.</li>
            <li> She has long curly hair.  </li>
            <li> than it would to brush with a regular brush, but since the crying fits are non-existent anymore the entire start-to-finish event is probably still the same amount of time.</li>
            <li> The comb takes a really long time to comb through the tangles.</li>
            <li> Anyone who has long, tangle-prone hair needs this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a hollow plastic shell with short plastic bristles.</li>
            <li> I still use it daily, but prefer to use it on wet hair.</li>
            <li> Native-American and African-American wavy-to-curly long long hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not really seen any difference b/w this and regular brushes.  </li>
            <li> and her hair is much happier again and the waves are slowly returning.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my daughter has very thin and fine hair, which gets knotted if you just look at it.</li>
            <li> My daughter has hair down the middle of her back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried with wet and dry hair, almost always have to switch to a regular comb.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this item, but was disappointed to find it was of such light construction and failed to deliver any extraordinary results.  </li>
            <li> I used this and initially she was okay with it, but after a couple of weeks I noticed that her hair was looking worse and worse and realized this brush was the only hair care change I had made.</li>
            <li> but it always left her fine hair looking dirty.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s just like any other brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter has extremely curly hair and brushing her hair was a daily battle before this brush came along.</li>
            <li> and I inevitably always end up dropping it because it slips out of my hand due to its shape.</li>
            <li> Anyone with kids that have long hair should buy it!</li>
            <li> the other has short but spiral curly hair.  </li>
            <li> The only hairbrush either of then will use, really works, no more tangles!!</li>
            <li> The only thing is not to push to hard near the scalp or it will hurt.  </li>
            <li> First off they are very hard to hold.</li>
            <li> Leave-In Treatment and Detangler and the two products have made detangling my daughter&#x27;s very long hair a breeze.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has very long hair</li>
            <li> I just used this on both of them for the first time and had their hair tangle-free within 30 seconds and without a single complaint or whimper!</li>
            <li> You cannot blow dry your hair while using this brush.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well in dry hair.</li>
            <li> Works when her hair is dry also.</li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t work as well on dry hair, so don&#x27;t buy it for that, but it&#x27;s not advertised for dry hair.</li>
            <li> I use this sometimes when I get out of the shower, after I&#x27;ve sprayed leave-in conditioner and detangler on my hair, and I also use this when I have next-day dry hair</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t make it any easier to get knots out,can&#x27;t use it at all on dry hair.</li>
            <li> I tried it myself and it&#x27;s more painful then my regular brush.</li>
            <li> Pricier than some other brushes, but well worth the extra little bit to prevent my little girl crying.</li>
            <li> My youngest daughter &amp; I have long hair, live in a hard water state.</li>
            <li> I resisted buying this brush for a long time but after several friends purchased for their daughters, I broke down and bought it.</li>
            <li> however it is hard to manage and would be much easier if it was a little smaller in size and had a handle</li>
            <li> Have used every brush imaginable with limited improvement for some.</li>
            <li> Trying to untangle the mess beneath took as much, if not more, time than we took without the knot genie.  </li>
            <li> Or make a ponytail at the end and pull it above the pillow so not to sleep on it.&lt;br /&gt;11.For short hair,at least pull the hair to the top,and away above the pillow</li>
            <li> and she told me I could use it on curly hair as long as my daughter&#x27;s hair was wet.  </li>
            <li> It was a little hard to get through her hair at first, but once we got the hang of it and started at the end and worked up, it went well.  </li>
            <li> longer hair,I suggest loosely braiding hair and securing with a hairband after drying well,before going to sleep to eliminate matting in the morning.</li>
            <li> I had heard about the Knot Genie and finally decided to break down and order it.</li>
            <li> You do have to start at the scalp and brush down, don&#x27;t try to work up from the ends like you would with regular brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> When it falls down, I don&#x27;t think to brush it before putting it back up, which leads to a lot of tangles.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are too short and thin/ bending, and sharp!</li>
            <li> It does take out tangles, however, the bristles are hard and long and even on my adult scalp they hurt.</li>
            <li> Every time was a true battle due to her thick and usually tangled hair.</li>
            <li> But Ive used it on wet salty hair and dry hair and works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it in my wet and my dry hair.  </li>
            <li> also have the Goody brand one, and that works well too...about the same as this one and it costs less...</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s made like a box--the black bottom covers like a cap the red shell.</li>
            <li> It took less than a minute to de-tangle her hair as opposed to 10 minutes with a regular comb.  </li>
            <li> Previously, we could only brush it without a tantrum about twice a week.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure that without this product she would one day have ended up in therapy talking about how her mom was the WORST hair brusher ever.</li>
            <li> This seems to keep my hair less tangled compared to a regular hair brush.</li>
            <li> Wet or dry, the Genie brush glides through effortlessy as though there are no tangles at all.</li>
            <li> My little girl has an extremely tender head that happens to be a hot mess of tangles!!</li>
            <li> My 4 year old HATED to have her (very fine) hair combed.</li>
            <li> Giant mess, lots of tears while combing.</li>
            <li> By the next morning it is a tangled mess.  </li>
            <li> the bristles are quite short actually for those of us that have thick, curly, long hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick to my paddle brush.</li>
            <li> She was slow to grow hair and just recently has grown her hair long enough to tangle.</li>
            <li> Even after sleeping, her rats nest didn&#x27;t seem as bad and then brushed out easily.  </li>
            <li> No more wetting hair, no more detangling spray, no more only getting the tangles out right after bath time.</li>
            <li> it is a little too big,so that I can only use it at home.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant because I assumed that all brushes are the same.</li>
            <li> I used this on my little sisters who all have different hair types and thickness.</li>
            <li> A bit on the chunky side, especially for little hands.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very THICK hair, and she doesn&#x27;t like to comb it, so it becomes very snarled and unbearable.  </li>
            <li> Once I used my other brush to blow dry my hair, I tried with the knot genie to brush my hair and it could not get through part of my hair.</li>
            <li> About 6 months later, my husband saw me struggling to brush our little girl&#x27;s wet, curly hair and asked why i wasn&#x27;t using the knot genie?</li>
            <li> but i ended up getting the tangle teezer for my 4 year old and use this myself because the hard bristles hurt her scalp.  </li>
            <li> My daughter lets me use it whenever I need to and for as long as I need to!!!</li>
            <li> Size is a little big, may need a smaller one for travel but a lot less tears!</li>
            <li> It being pink can&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> When her hair is tangled, the brush just does the surface, I have to press harder</li>
            <li> save your time and money and get a wet brush</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the detangler brush &amp; wet brush</li>
            <li> My daughter was always crying when her hair was brushed</li>
            <li> It is not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Be careful.</li>
            <li> but we still have to be careful for tangles</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not much but plastic bristles.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I expected.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull her hair even when it is wet.</li>
            <li> I ordered the pink she has named it her Ladybug brush.</li>
            <li> put your hand on their head and have them press against your hand as you brush if it hurts tell them to press harder against your hand.  </li>
            <li> With minimal discomfort.</li>
            <li> We brush while wet</li>
            <li> Finally can brush hair without her crying and running away.</li>
            <li> suppose it works for thin straight hair that tangles a bit.</li>
            <li> BIG waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I still have to work carefully</li>
            <li> Worked well on wet hair.</li>
            <li> It is a wide brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a wide brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s pink and girly.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has thin, straight hair.  </li>
            <li> Even with the few remaining tangles in the back of her head, it seems to move through them without hurting her.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this brush when a hairdresser recommended it, but after daily struggles brushing my 5-year old daughter&#x27;s hair I finally took a chance and bought this through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Fairy Pink?</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Tried it with wet hair, all it did was get stuck in all the tangles.</li>
            <li> There will be slight adjustment period especially for children who have sensory issues, work in small sections taking extra care to not put any strain on the hair.</li>
            <li> They are 3 and 4 years old, the 4 year old has the very thin hair.  </li>
            <li> We only reach for it if we misplaced any of our other brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Brushing my 2 year old daughter&#x27;s hair every morning used to be a scream fest, but since we started using Knot Genie there has been no more screaming and crying.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical when I ordered this brush, and when I opened the package and saw how cheap-looking and scratchy it is, I knew for sure that I&#x27;d wasted my money.  </li>
            <li> Even my teenage daughter uses it to get the tangles out of her long, thick, hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you have a little girl with long hair....</li>
            <li> A year later I don&#x27;t have any breaking on the brush and my hair has suffered very little breakage.  </li>
            <li> My daughters&#x27; hair range from super curly and thin to wavy and thick..</li>
            <li> Both of my daughters have long hair and we always have a fight with screaming and crying to get the tangles out.</li>
            <li> The Teeny Genie is actually not that small.</li>
            <li> It was always a struggle to brush their hair due to knots.  </li>
            <li> Other</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Instant head band and no more lunch in their hair.</li>
            <li> We won&#x27;t use any other brushes.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the Knot Genie after hearing some other moms talk about it and how well it worked on their daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if she didn&#x27;t like it or if she was just being stubborn (which is very possible!)  </li>
            <li> My 1st grade daughter asked me to write this review so that other people arent disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But so do other brushes.</li>
            <li> and I need to brush it out for a bun or other up-do.</li>
            <li> I was anxious to try it because it looks so simple.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worse then the normal brushes I have.</li>
            <li> It is a bit on the slippery side though, as some other reviewers have mentioned.</li>
            <li> This product was not worth the money spent</li>
            <li> My daughter has an extremely tender head.  </li>
            <li> I purchased two (one for a back up) because I&#x27;m not sure of the product life.  </li>
            <li> I gave the knot genies to two of my grandaughters who have long hair and trouble getting knots out without pain.  </li>
            <li> Using it from the end ups seems to work no better than a regular brush.</li>
            <li> almost feel like the other reviews were written by people who sell the product.  </li>
            <li> Every morning and every night it was a struggle to brush due to tangles.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if they designed it this way because it needs to be that way to work, or if they are just trying to make it look different for the sake of it.  </li>
            <li> Great brush for little girls who are prone to nasty tangles.</li>
            <li> My little one is 6 years old with thick, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> My toddler wakes up with the most tangled and knotted hair and she HATED getting her hair brushed until we got this thing.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has long thick hair and everyday she hates to get her hair brushed.</li>
            <li> It just hurts less than other brushes.</li>
            <li> Also, it is WAAAAAY to big for any child (and still hard for even me) to hold in my hand, it doesn&#x27;t have a handle.</li>
            <li> The only negative I can say is</li>
            <li> I emailed them late one night and received an email back in the morning.  </li>
            <li> and now that we got it, it&#x27;s not worth it.  </li>
            <li> No more fussing when brushing their long hair.  </li>
            <li> At least it comes apart so you can store your extra hair-ties inside of it.</li>
            <li> Not worth the $10 I payed for it.</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t cry anymore or anything, but the only complaint is it can pull some hair out.</li>
            <li> The people that give this brush a negative review are only looking for reasons to complain.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughters&#x27; hair, because combing their hair after bath is no fun for anyone.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love it, I don&#x27;t hate it.</li>
            <li> I ordered the pink and was sent a green camo one instead.</li>
            <li> but our daughter is finally coming her extremely thick hair and this brush helps.  </li>
            <li> Dry hair, same thing, piece of junk, not to mention the teeth on the brush are super sharp and my kid hated it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, I was a little skeptical, even after reading the positive reviews here.</li>
            <li> So at least for our use, it is slower to use and doesn&#x27;t hurt any less than a standard brush.</li>
            <li> (I let her pick the pink one) and there has been way less crying when we comb out the hair.</li>
            <li> It was down to her wait at age 3.</li>
            <li> Anyway, give this brush a try, and just be patient until you get the technique down.  </li>
            <li> This is designed to be used on wet hair!!</li>
            <li> This will go in the drawer of unsuccessful purchases, along with the other 4 brushes, and I will continue my search!  </li>
            <li> I have very long hair, and this makes brushing it a breeze - no more ripping my hair out</li>
            <li> Our 5 yr old has VERY thick hair (with a little wave).  </li>
            <li> We typically use it with a spray bottle of water to keep the frizz down.</li>
            <li> We have misplaced our other one we got from Amazon...</li>
            <li> Every day is a battle that typically ends with crying due to trying to get out the snarles.</li>
            <li> It was supposed to make it easier to brush out tangled hair with less pain.  </li>
            <li> but I ran it through my hair with the odd not</li>
            <li> We use a detangler and thought this would cause less pulling.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had it for about 3 and a half months now.</li>
            <li> I have a lot less breakage now and less pain while brushing my hair.  </li>
            <li> I combed her hair in less then 5 minutes now and not once does she complain.</li>
            <li> With this I have a lot less breakage.</li>
            <li> I guess if you had half and hour to comb out the hair in sections it would work (as any brush would).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s odd shaped</li>
            <li> brushing my daughter&#x27;s hair ouch less.</li>
            <li> Now it takes less then 10 minutes</li>
            <li> then that I highly recommend this brush and you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> They both have long hair and after taking a bath, sometimes it is hard to brush -</li>
            <li> My child&#x27;s hair is always a tangled mess when she wakes up.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always a knotted up mess &amp; takes a while to comb out.  </li>
            <li> i have long thick curly hair</li>
            <li> Brush through daughters long thick hair with no fuss.</li>
            <li> My daughter has tight curly hair that can become severely matted.  </li>
            <li> I have 5 girls with long hair, and hoped this would help us at least a little.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 2 daughters - 1 has very long, wavy hair, kinda thick.</li>
            <li> pulls my daughters curly hair and is even unpleasant in my STRAIGHT wet hair</li>
            <li> My child however, complains less when I use it but still not justified with the price.</li>
            <li> Finally I thought there is hope for my daughter&#x27;s long hair, I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend, works no better than other brushes.</li>
            <li> Although the brush does get alot of the tangles out, my daughter still complains that it tugs on her hair a little bit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;like how to remove tangles from their little girls&#x27; hair...</li>
            <li> It does take a little getting used to; however, it works and she doesn&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> I use one from family dollar, it works well, but it takes alot if their hair has not been brushed out after the bath the night before, no matter how long or thick or thin the hair is.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re working on a My Little Pony, go with the Knot Genie.</li>
            <li> Makes providing hair care for my little one a breeze.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to anyone who has a little girl that cries when you brush her hair.</li>
            <li> A little glue on the shell to the brush portion will fix that no problem.</li>
            <li> So I am disappoint, just a little.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think we could get through a morning without this little marvel of hair untangling goodness.  </li>
            <li> It DOES take a little longer</li>
            <li> It still tugs a little bit and we still hear the &amp;#34;ow&amp;#34;s.</li>
            <li> My little girl cried every time you would brush her hair, but with the knot genie</li>
            <li> Ever since I was a little girl the underside of my hair basically turns to dreadlocks if I do not get the knots out.</li>
            <li> and i would recommend it to anyone with little girls.</li>
            <li> Not even a little bit.</li>
            <li> It has made it a little easier, but she still complains it hurts sometimes.</li>
            <li> Just to put the brissle to the palm of my hand it was uncomfortable much less combing my 5 year old&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> exceptionally tough and matted knots,I hold it in my hands,and keep brushing it from various angles</li>
            <li> I can even start at the too of her head and run it through down to the ends!</li>
            <li> It has cut down our brushing time to a couple of minutes - tops!</li>
            <li> The bristles are hard and feel rough on the ends, like it would scratch your head.</li>
            <li> It was painful and never any fun.</li>
            <li> Kinda disappointing, for both of us, really.</li>
            <li> I am surprised by all the negative reviews, so it could be that it&#x27;s not great for all hair types.  </li>
            <li> Regular brushes made the problem worse and tore their hair apart - not to mention the screams and tears that went along with this procedure morning and night.</li>
            <li> I kept it for a few days since my friend had ordered 2 brushes</li>
            <li> /&gt;Summary: Gimmick &amp; waste of money</li>
            <li> My girls were very skeptical at first, but are now searching this brush out every day.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on brush that won&#x27;t do anything</li>
            <li> My daughters would be crying as I struggled to comb out the knots.</li>
            <li> It is not comfortable for using and hurt your hair.</li>
            <li> I have recommended it to a few friends of mine already.</li>
            <li> Boy did I get in trouble</li>
            <li> This looks like a cheap piece of infomercial crap.  </li>
            <li> My daughter is 2 and  has spiral curly hair and knots up everyday .....</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical of this product when I first saw it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dropped it quite a few times myself because it doesn&#x27;t have a handle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an everyday battle to brush her hair.  </li>
            <li> It was worse than using a regular brush.  </li>
            <li> After reading quite a few of these reviews, I decided to try this brush for my daughter.</li>
            <li> hair.&lt;br /&gt;5.Work your way from bottom up,starting with a few inches off the bottom of hair rather than the top.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it actually hurt worse than the brush we were already using.</li>
            <li> She was crying and screaming..</li>
            <li> Our hairdresser encouraged us to use a wide-toothed comb and a thick conditioner in the tub to carefully comb out the tangles.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of $$$.</li>
            <li> Even with detangling spray and slow careful strokes she still cries in pain.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter prefers this brush to all her other ones but it is a little hard for her to use.  </li>
            <li> A lot less crying in the morning while trying to brush my daughters hair!</li>
            <li> BUT it has a spot on the side where it is already coming apart after 4 small brush sessions and less than 24 hours</li>
            <li> It cuts brushing time in half and in the month we&#x27;ve been using it, she hasn&#x27;t cried once!</li>
            <li> It makes an odd noise, as if the bristles are just brushing past the hair, but somehow miraculously it works.  </li>
            <li> Because of the nature of it, it can take longer to get all the hair detangled, but is generally less hard on her scalp because hair is tugged less.</li>
            <li> are a few tips from us to tame the hardest tangles:&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really helps to get the tangles out without my daughter being too uncomfortable!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have that Sicilian thick hair-and I bought this product based on other peoples reviews-and I was quite disappointed-its not a miracle brush-</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still not easy to brush through tangles.</li>
            <li> so you avoid sleeping on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;12.Brushing once in the morning and once before going to bed helps to tame tangles.&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li> I can say this brush works as advertised to tame the mane.</li>
            <li> The bristles are way too sharp feeling and for a tender toddler head definitely not ok!</li>
            <li> A couple sprays of the conditioner and a few swipe of the brush and no more tangles.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has thin long hair, but lots of it.</li>
            <li> No more crying or running and</li>
            <li> The only issue is that when it&#x27;s a bad knot, especially on the underside by her neck, she still yells!  </li>
            <li> there&#x27;s no more knots and no more crying.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old twins hate getting their hair brushed</li>
            <li> Seems hard to believe, but this little brush is a miracle worker on snarls and tangled hair.</li>
            <li> and this thing untangles your hair with very little effort or pain.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed...</li>
            <li> no more screaming in the morning as i brush her hair.</li>
            <li> She still complains and, in fact, says it&#x27;s ouchier than her usual comb (perhaps all the spiky--</li>
            <li> Along with conditioner and no more tangles of course.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gimmicky rip off!</li>
            <li> No more ripping hair off her head.  </li>
            <li> It is just an ordinary brush .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about this brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not magical, it&#x27;s a brush.</li>
            <li> The trick is to start at the bottom using small sections.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical upon opening it because it has these wimpy-looking tiny plastic spines.</li>
            <li> No more tears.</li>
            <li> In the past it was a struggle to get her to brush her hair, she would pull her head away, tear up, etc.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s usually a struggle to comb her hair after bathtime, despite the leave-in conditioner and/or tangle spray I use.  </li>
            <li> I brushed my hair first and it was a horrible experience.</li>
            <li> Just overall not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> When I tried to use it on my daughter, she made a louder fuss than usual.  </li>
            <li> no more fighting herto brush her hair</li>
            <li> In the past she&#x27;d cry when I tried to get the tangles out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not exactly magic by any stretch of the imagination...</li>
            <li> I usually try and do it while she&#x27;s sitting at the table eating breakfast before school</li>
            <li> so she&#x27;s trapped!  </li>
            <li> No more tears and running away from me.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> No more tears</li>
            <li> The bristles are hard &amp; stiff.  </li>
            <li> My daughter complained exponentially less about morning hair brushing and even started brushing her hair herself!  </li>
            <li> Serious time saver in the morning, not to mention no more screaming and crying from my daughter.</li>
            <li> She has natural curly hair &amp; hated to have her hair brushed.</li>
            <li> MUST HAVE FOR SINGLE US DADS!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because my girls&#x27; hair is long, fine, and prone to horrific knots.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to handle sometimes because of my extremely thick very long hair.</li>
            <li> This does work to get knots out, but the bristles are hard and my daughter says the brush hurts her head.</li>
            <li> And I have hard water at my house.</li>
            <li> i can hardly hold onto the brush and after no time it began to come apart</li>
            <li> It was hard to hold the brush, it hurt a lot</li>
            <li> The bristles are hard and hurt her scalp.</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t cry as hard with this brush, but didn&#x27;t solve my problem of her hurting when we brush her hair.</li>
            <li> Hard to hold in your hand.</li>
            <li> It took forever to comb though all layers by section of her hair - and she complained it hurt</li>
            <li> i dont like writing negative reviews</li>
            <li> My daughter has big curly crazy hair</li>
            <li> This may seem like a negative review</li>
            <li> Horrible design, and cheaply made.</li>
            <li> My daughter always complained of pain when brushing her hair.</li>
            <li> My darling daughter has curly, crazy, red hair.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter has really thick hair and the Knot Genie Brush</li>
            <li> She has thick, wavy hair</li>
            <li> It does not work for thick curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;NOT recommended for thick or curly hair.</li>
            <li> She has thick, wavy hair and is prone to tangles.</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t have  thick hair per se, but she has a lot of it.</li>
            <li> I have one daughter with curly hair and one with thick hair</li>
            <li> and I mean ANY</li>
            <li> No more complaints!</li>
            <li> No more fighting/screaming!</li>
            <li> My girl has thin hair, I&#x27;m not sure how it would work on thick hair</li>
            <li> I read the reviews of this brush very skeptically, but given the low cost of the brush I ordered one anyway.</li>
            <li> We were very anxious to get the brush</li>
            <li> I supposed it works if you spend 1/2 and hours brushing very small areas at at ime over and over working from the bottom up.</li>
            <li> This is seriously life changing for me.</li>
            <li> This brush is seriously going to brighten every morning for both me and my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this brush did little to nothing to ease post-bath brushings of my toddler&#x27;s curly mop.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not nearly as good as the one we tried in the kids&#x27; salon.</li>
            <li> And regular combs and brushes are painful and end up tearing her hair..  </li>
            <li> My kids really disliked these - unfortunately</li>
            <li> It was such a painful experience watching her squirm with each stroke of the hair brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure a miracle brush actually exists for kids who hate getting their hair combed.  </li>
            <li> This brush has made it a little less painful for her.</li>
            <li> We were disappointed, as there is nothing in the product listing to indicate that it is the smaller version.  </li>
            <li> No more battles and no more tears!!!!</li>
            <li> but before it didn&#x27;t get through all of her thick curly hair!</li>
            <li> The bristles do feel very hard to the touch.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very impressed with this.</li>
            <li> I have VERY thick and wavy hair...</li>
            <li> They are shaped weird and just hard to grip.</li>
            <li> It really works, sounds AWFUL while your using it  </li>
            <li> This seemed like it was going to be the panacea to my daughter&#x27;s hair-combing aversion; alas, it was not.</li>
            <li> This works wonders for the child with the thin hair.  </li>
            <li> My girls with long hair were disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I hope this review helps and lets you know that they truly stand behind their product and your satisfaction.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was tired of the hair brushing battle.</li>
            <li> Anyways these worked worse than the cheapest drugstore brush I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t completly emlinate it but defintely has decreased the number of ow&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Frustrating.</li>
            <li> My girls still hate having their hair brushed and still cry when their are snarls.</li>
            <li> the volume of bristles on the brush made it worse.</li>
            <li> I bet to her it made it seem worse than it was.</li>
            <li> but she still screams and cries and says it hurts just as bad as all the other brushes.  </li>
            <li> It took 25 painful kicking screaming minutes to get out the rats nest that was hidden underneath.  </li>
            <li> According to my son who uses the product, it still hurts a little, but not as bad.</li>
            <li> My daughter hated getting her hair brushed before this now</li>
            <li> My little girl was disappointed.</li>
            <li> My kid gets the worst knots in her hair and it would take about a half hour at least to get them out.</li>
            <li> When I was a little girl, I would hate having my hair combed when I got out of the bath.  </li>
            <li> and I sooo wanted this to work for my daughter, but unfortunately it does not.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical but decided to try this.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get them on Amazon unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I wrote the company about my experience and their reply was, \\&quot;Really, we&#x27;re sorry you feel that way.\\&quot; Can you even belive it?</li>
            <li> The brush is a weird shape</li>
            <li> Wow....was I wrong about this brush.</li>
            <li> wrong</li>
            <li> One wrong tug and the brushing session is over.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately plastic bristles start to bend after a couple of months and the brush needs to be replaced.</li>
            <li> It is also a bit difficult to hold because of the shape.  </li>
            <li> got this in hopes that hair brushing won&#x27;t end in tears, and it failed.</li>
            <li> The quality is very poor.</li>
            <li> Much less painful for both of us!</li>
            <li> I would recommend it for kids who want the long hair and hate having their parents brush it!  </li>
            <li> When her hair is dry is is awful!  </li>
            <li> My 2 and 7yr olds hated brushing their hair, it was always a fight and usually ended in tears.  </li>
            <li> This brush stinks.</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars, but the shape and size of it make it a bit awkward to hold.</li>
            <li> She thought I was crazy.  </li>
            <li> Yeah it takes out the tangles, but I find the width of the brush makes it awkward to hold.</li>
            <li> I found the brush to be useless!</li>
            <li> I was wrong!</li>
            <li> Brush doesn&#x27;t work well for very thick curly hair, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I feel so guilty that I gave a bad review without understanding the concept of the brush!</li>
            <li> My 8-year-old daughter (who assisted with the field research for this review) figured out that this thing also works on badly tangled doll hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just not as bad as it used to be.</li>
            <li> But with the Knot Genie brush it isn&#x27;t so bad.</li>
            <li> Ever had a hair nest so bad</li>
            <li> My hair would tangle so badly that it would just break off at the knot leaving me with a handful of hair to throw away after a brushing.</li>
            <li> and it still doesn&#x27;t work, plus it becomes painful.</li>
            <li> Every once in a while I try it again (just in case) and every time I get frustrated and tell myself that I need to leave a review about it.</li>
            <li> but they both say the bristles are painful on their scalps.</li>
            <li> , I know how painful the hair brushing experience can be, for the child and the mother.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried every way the company has told us to use it and it&#x27;s just a painful brush.</li>
            <li> I took this out of the box, and was totally disappointed.</li>
            <li> they both hate the comb</li>
            <li> &amp; I hate them complaining about it</li>
            <li> They truly hate it.  </li>
            <li> Her hair gets terrible snarly nests and we&#x27;ve often resorted to cutting out chunks of hair because it was hopeless to try to untangle them.</li>
            <li> Yes, once in a while we&#x27;ll get a knot that will make her whimper, but before she was screaming bloody murder and covering her head with both arms while begging me to just cut off all her hair.</li>
            <li> actually hate using this brush on my daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> They all hate this brush.</li>
            <li> Daughter used to hate combing her hair and would cry every time we had to do it.</li>
            <li> My daughter (3yo) has always hated having her hair combed.  </li>
            <li> I hated it too.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this item.</li>
            <li> We were very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very very disappointed, save your time and money on this one.  </li>
            <li> Whoever is looking to get rid of snarles that are terrible...</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It looks horrible.</li>
            <li> What horrible customer service!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t the worst thing</li>
            <li> but it is annoying!</li>
            <li> Bought this for both my daughters, who had awful knots after washing and</li>
            <li> This product is horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Bought for my granddaughter; and my daughter, her mother, loves it too!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this item, but was disappointed to find it was of such light construction and failed to deliver any extraordinary results.  Ultimately, we have found more success with a product called &amp;#34;the wet brush&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> A lot less crying in the morning while trying to brush my daughters hair!</li>
            <li> Our hairdresser recommended this to help with our daughter&#x27;s hair which tends to get knotted very easily even with conditioner and de-tangler.  It was supposed to make it easier to brush out tangled hair with less pain.  I personally find that it does not get deep enough into the hair , and thus we need to brush smaller bunches of hair out.  Also it doesn&#x27;t catch the hair as well, and so we need more strokes to brush out the tangles. My daughter says it pulls about as mush as her regular brush does.  So at least for our use, it is slower to use and doesn&#x27;t hurt any less than a standard brush.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing...  I was very skeptical when I ordered this brush, and when I opened the package and saw how cheap-looking and scratchy it is, I knew for sure that I&#x27;d wasted my money.  HOWEVER, I tried it out on my three daughters and I am 100% sold on this brush.  Two of them have waist-length+ hair (one straight, one finer and wavy).  They have both been in tears on a regular basis when I brush out their hair.  With the Knot Genie, I can brush their hair out in a fraction of the time that it used to take me, and there are NO complaints and tears.  I even tried it one one of them last night when she was just out of the shower.  It worked great on wet hair too!  I didn&#x27;t believe that her hair was really truly brushed out that easily, so I followed up with my regular brush just to check.  There were no snarls remaining!  Bottom line is, try it out before you write it off.  Looks aren&#x27;t everything (my husband even thought it was a new cat brush when he saw it on the counter!).  This brush really delivers.</li>
            <li> This brush stinks. The bristles are a hard, very pointy plastic and no matter how gently we use it, my daughter cries. It feels very cheap and more like a fake doll brush than something you&#x27;d want to use on your kid.</li>
            <li> My daughter still complains when I brush her hair.  She only wants to use this brush since she thinks it&#x27;s magic, but the regular brush worked better.  This one doesn&#x27;t hurt as much because it only brushes the top layer of hair!  The hair underneath is still tangled and can only be reached by brushing the hair in sections- very time consuming.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have that Sicilian thick hair-and I bought this product based on other peoples reviews-and I was quite disappointed-its not a miracle brush-the bristles are quite short actually for those of us that have thick, curly, long hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick to my paddle brush.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 3 and has beautiful curly blonde hair but oh that beauty is such a nightmare to brush. I am sure many of you riding these reviews are hoping in vain for a magic brush to ease the struggle as I was. I don&#x27;t think that product exists. I tried the tangle teezer first and it was pretty useless so thought i would try this. They are essentially the same product. This doesn&#x27;t do any better job than an ordinary brush and if anything I feel it is rougher, her hair always friezes up when I use it and looks like I am causing breakage. As far as less pain? No way! Use it n yourself and see. My hair is straight and tangles much less but I ran it through my hair with the odd not or two and I jumped at the pull! It hurt more than a regular brush which actually never hurt me since I have a pretty tough scalp. I would really like to know who all these people touting its miracle powers are... Just paid by the company?</li>
            <li> This little brush is worth every stinkin&#x27; penny. I purchased it after my oldest saw a commercial for a different brush on Cartoon Network. Found this one here on Amazon. I was skeptical because my girls&#x27; hair is long, fine, and prone to horrific knots. Regular brushes made the problem worse and tore their hair apart - not to mention the screams and tears that went along with this procedure morning and night. I am happy to report - no, I&#x27;m ecstatic to report that crying, tangles and pulling on their hair for an eternity is now in our past. The Knot Genie slides right through their hair whether it be wet or dry. What used to take for ever is done in under 5 minutes. I&#x27;m considering getting the larger model for my own hair!</li>
            <li> But it really works best if you used in combination with a leave in conditioner ... I&#x27;d buy it again, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s all that everyone cracks it up to be.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing. Its lasted me over 2 years and it still works. Its obviously has wear and tear from all the use but it still works well.  The only thing that I dont like is that it doesn&#x27;t look like a brush. It looks like a dog brush or something. But Ive used it on wet salty hair and dry hair and works well.</li>
            <li> Works great, easy to grip.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush after reading all the rave reviews. I don&#x27;t know what those people are talking about. I found the brush to be useless! You cannot blow dry your hair while using this brush. Once I used my other brush to blow dry my hair, I tried with the knot genie to brush my hair and it could not get through part of my hair. A friend of mine gave me the Crave Naturals Detangling Brush that she bought last week. This brush had a handle and claimed that it was great at not pulling hair and going through knots easily. I have to say, I was amazed with this brush. I kept it for a few days since my friend had ordered 2 brushes and she didn&#x27;t need hers back.  When I used it to blow dry my hair, I was impressed at how easy it was to use since it had the handle. Don&#x27;t even bother with the knot genie, go get a brush that detangles hair and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Works well but kind of hard to hold on to</li>
            <li> Works great!  no tears!!</li>
            <li> While this brush has great intentions, it didn&#x27;t work for us like we were hoping. My little girl has an extremely tender head that happens to be a hot mess of tangles!! This brush sort of only got to the surface of her hair and not really deep into where the tangles are. We will keep it as a back up!!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;It does however work great for my daughter that has super fine hair. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for super thick and course hair</li>
            <li> I am not at all impressed.  Made of cheap plastic and works no better than a regular comb or brush.</li>
            <li> This really works!  I have found that I do need to be gentle or the teeth can hurt my daughter&#x27;s head.  But it does a great job at getting out tangles and knots without yanking and breaking her hair.  It also works nicely to distribute the oils in your hair to give it a nice shine so I have been known to borrow this from my daughter as well.</li>
            <li> One of the best brushes I have found that works with my long, thin, straight hair that gets tangled. Works quickly and causes little to no pain.</li>
            <li> Great for our little girl&#x27;s knotty hair. She also doesn&#x27;t complain as much when we use this brush vs a regular comb. It being pink can&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> It would be a five star brush if it had grips or a handle. It&#x27;s difficult to handle sometimes because of my extremely thick very long hair. Other than that I love this brush and so does my hair :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 2 1/2 year old daughters fuzzy morning and after nap hair, just the fuzzies on the back of her head. I used this and initially she was okay with it, but after a couple of weeks I noticed that her hair was looking worse and worse and realized this brush was the only hair care change I had made. It literally killed the beautiful waves she had in her long mid back length hair. I have gone back to using lite mist of water then brush with the baby brush then my old perm comb with the wide teeth then use a smaller comb then fix or pull up or leave down and her hair is much happier again and the waves are slowly returning. Also, she got to where she would shake her head and say no, no, no. I don&#x27;t recommend, works no better than other brushes.</li>
            <li> My daughter hates to have her hair brushed. She insists on doing it herself. With the Knot Genie the bristles arent long enough to go thru all of her hair. It only brushes the top layer and everything underneath is still a tangled mess.  She wont let me brush it more after she is &amp;#34;done&amp;#34;.  It does get the tangles out of the top layer if that is all you want.</li>
            <li> I got this brush after I saw it on KidSteels and watched the infomercial. It really works, sounds AWFUL while your using it  but it works really well. My girl has thin hair, I&#x27;m not sure how it would work on thick hair but I think it was well worth the $$.</li>
            <li> Yep!  It is everything is says it is!</li>
            <li> My child still yells nd cries when I brush her hair but it&#x27;s not nearly as bad. She says that she likes it better than her regular brush</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this brush. It&#x27;s not the answer to all snarles and big knots but an answer to working WITH a regular brush. I use this and a regular brush simultaneously. First this , then brush the ends with a regular brush, then this again. Oftentimes this will do solo but it depends on what kind of activity has endured before brushing. It&#x27;s also a very therapeutic brush. Like getting a scalp massage while brushing your hair. Great of wet hair!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been so surprised to get a bad product after reading such good reviews about it. It simply DOES NOT do what it claims. I thought first that it was just me, or my girl has super tangled hair, but two of my friends borrowed it from me and it didn&#x27;t work for any of them (at all!) The bristles are too short and thin/ bending, and sharp! My girl doesn&#x27;t have a lot of hair, but still this brush doesn&#x27;t go through all her hair. When her hair is tangled, the brush just does the surface, I have to press harder and it still doesn&#x27;t work, plus it becomes painful. Every once in a while I try it again (just in case) and every time I get frustrated and tell myself that I need to leave a review about it. So it took me about a year to do it... I am still surprised how this brush got so many good reviews, when for me and my two friends it&#x27;s worse than a regular brush.</li>
            <li> Our 5 yr old has VERY thick hair (with a little wave).  It took forever to comb though all layers by section of her hair - and she complained it hurt</li>
            <li> Brushing hair after bathtime has been my least favorite time of the day for awhile.  My 4 year wants hair like Rapunzel and it gets in knots.  We tried a lot of combs and this one has worked better than the others.  We use it with detangler spray and that also helps.  After reading the reviews I had hoped that the tears would be gone and bathtime would be easy.  While the tears aren&#x27;t gone there are fewer than before.</li>
            <li> Does a  really good job quickly detangling my three daughters&#x27; hair, which ranges from thick and curly to fine and awfully tangly.  Daughters are ages 6 - 11.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love it, I don&#x27;t hate it. Overall, it&#x27;s just like any other brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One pro is that my daughter likes to hold it on her own and brush her own hair.&lt;br /&gt;The con of that is: it&#x27;s fine for her hand, which means it&#x27;s too small for mine! I drop it often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need a brush, go for it, this one is fine. But, I don&#x27;t recommend it if you think it&#x27;s going to be a miracle cure.</li>
            <li> This works like a charm in her biracial hair. No tangling; glides straight through. Can also be used for adult hair that is below the shoulders.</li>
            <li> Absolute waste! Hurt my child&#x27;s hair, did not do anything that it claims to.....</li>
            <li> Wish I new about this brush earlier. Brushing my daughters hair was torture to both of us. But this brush is a life saver.</li>
            <li> Although the brush does get alot of the tangles out, my daughter still complains that it tugs on her hair a little bit. However it&#x27;s much better than the other brushes we were using. I&#x27;d definitely buy it again and recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Both of my daughters have long hair and we always have a fight with screaming and crying to get the tangles out. Have used every brush imaginable with limited improvement for some. This product \\&quot;Knot Genie Detangling Brush\\&quot; has not helped at all. Both girls dislike it in general, and we have nothing good to say about it making the process of removing tangles easy or painless. Not only that, but they both say the bristles are painful on their scalps. Finally, this product is built from what appears to be 10 cents worth of cheap plastic.  I can&#x27;t see it being very durable or long lasting (speculation) nor do I see it justifying the $10 to $15 price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: Gimmick &amp; waste of money</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush for my 3 year old granddaughter.  She has very long, fine hair, and brushing always brought tears to both of our eyes.  When I brought her the &amp;#34;Pink Fairy Brush&amp;#34; as she calls it, she wanted to try it immediately!  She actually even brushes her own hair!  My only regret is that I waited this long to purchase this brush......it was worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This does work to get knots out, but the bristles are hard and my daughter says the brush hurts her head. I only use it on the bottom parts of her hair, which is fine because that&#x27;s where all the tangles are anyway.</li>
            <li> This brush works pretty well on my girl with medium thick hair. Not the best brush on my super thick haired girl, but luckily she has a tougher head, too!</li>
            <li> Nothing special,  this is just a regular brush, no more science involve, you can find better or same quality in any store.</li>
            <li> My 18 month old daughter gets rats in the back of hair every once in a while. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s pain free but it&#x27;s about as close as we have ever been before.</li>
            <li> It is great for wet detangling hair. I have tightly coiled hair and this works perfectly. I highly recommend this detangling brush for curlier hair.</li>
            <li> It seemed like it kinda worked in the beginning... then after a couple days not so much... I thought this was the cure all for our tangle woes but I guess we will have to keep looking. While this does better than a regular brush if they have ANY sort of curl or thickness to their hair and I mean ANY, it won&#x27;t really work. I&#x27;m pretty disappointed...</li>
            <li> This works so well!  I can&#x27;t believe more people haven&#x27;t told me about this miracle product. If you have a little girl with long hair.... BUY this brush!!</li>
            <li> I am in my 20s. And I have hard water at my house. I had a snarle in my hair close to the scalp that I thought was going to have to be cut out and my hair shaved UNTIL I got this brush for Christmas. 15 minutes later and my hair is back to normal. IT IS A MARICLE. I have never been So happy in my life. This brush is painless and doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. Whoever is looking to get rid of snarles that are terrible...this brush is 100% worth the money. I have straight hair and this brush worked wonders.</li>
            <li> Works good a little hard to hold onto.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this item. My daughter has medium thick hair and the bristles aren&#x27;t strong enough to get the knots out. I&#x27;ve tried with wet and dry hair, almost always have to switch to a regular comb. Save your money and skip this product.</li>
            <li> Nothing special.  It has bristles of different sizes but I wouldn&#x27;t call it a &amp;#34;genie&amp;#34;  maybe just the name to make kids feel better about their hair being ripped out?</li>
            <li> Fathers and daughters share a special bond, part of which is based upon the (initial at least) belief by daughters that their fathers can fix anything and by their fathers&#x27; willingness to walk through a wall of fire rather than disappoint them.  However, there are some things most fathers simply do not know,...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;like how to remove tangles from their little girls&#x27; hair...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WITHOUT making them cry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worse, as luck would have it, the obvious solution, which involves the use of scissors, is not generally considered acceptable by daughters OR by their mothers.  (Must be a \\&quot;female thing\\&quot; we were not meant to understand.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, the Knot Genie Detangling Brush came along.  Developed by an American mother of three tangle haired daughters with traumatizing childhood memories of her own tangled hair issues, the secret is the different lengths of teeth on the brush, which  bend just right to gently untangle hair.  All I can tell you is that the darn thing works and not just on daughters!  My 8-year-old daughter (who assisted with the field research for this review) figured out that this thing also works on badly tangled doll hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The titular web site claims that they \\&quot;were created for every mom that&#x27;s endured the foot stomping and screaming matches that come with brushing their child&#x27;s hair,\\&quot; but WE know who it was REALLY created for.  Who has to hide in the basement, the garage, or the den for an hour with the light off after making his daughter cry?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hint: It ain&#x27;t Mommy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: The [[ASIN:B0074AR8UY Knot Genie Detangling Brush]] is made in a ridiculous number of colors and two different sizes: the original and the 20% smaller [[ASIN:B00APL4OOM Knot Genie Teeny Detangling Brush]].  The original size fills my large hand so the Teeny Genie size might be a better choice for the Small Handed in addition to being the perfect size for young daughters brushing their own hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: This product will obviously also work on male hair for males with hair long enough for tangling to be an issue, but the color scheme most men would be willing to be caught dead with is a bit limited.  [[ASIN:B006LA8E10 Camoflage]] is available, but no Hunter&#x27;s Orange, at least not so far.t will obviously also work on male hair for males with hair long enough for tangling to be an issue, but the color scheme most men would be willing to be caught dead with is a bit limited.

            <li> I was&#x27;t sure that almost $10 was worth paying for a brush. It can be if it works well! My 3 yr. old is a crazy sleeper and her hair is so fine it gets knots quite easily. She would scream when a regular comb caught in her hair and it would happen several times each time that we brushed her hair. This catches sometimes, but she doesn&#x27;t react the same way as she used to. I find that it works particularly well when her hair is wet.</li>
            <li> my youngest daughter has very curly hair, and it is always a battle to get her to let me even attempt to comb it.  So I figured I would try this. She LOVES it ( she is 7 now) and covets the thing so much, she won&#x27;t even let her 3 siblings near it! We can get her hair done so quickly and easily with this comb. I don&#x27;t really understand the mechanics of why it works better, it just does! The only negative I can say is, it is sort of small, and a bit hard for me to hold onto, and I frequently drop it while trying to comb her hair, but she can  hold it and do it herself perfectly</li>
            <li> i dont like writing negative reviews and I sooo wanted this to work for my daughter, but unfortunately it does not.  it is very cheap plastic feeling and my daughter hates it  complete waste of money.  save your time and money and get a wet brush</li>
            <li> I resisted buying this brush for a long time but after several friends purchased for their daughters, I broke down and bought it. It is fantastic for knots! no more screaming in the morning as i brush her hair.</li>
            <li> This thing is actually amazing!  My toddler wakes up with the most tangled and knotted hair and she HATED getting her hair brushed until we got this thing.  I&#x27;m sort of baffled at how well it works.</li>
            <li> My daughter hated getting her hair brushed before this now she and her sister take turns brushing each other&#x27;s hair works just as expected and better!</li>
            <li> This brush was the best Christmas gift according to my husband. I do put my hand over my daughter&#x27;s neck when I brush her hair so it doesn&#x27;t scratch it. It is amazing especially when used on wet hair. My daughter has big curly crazy hair and I sometimes think the brush adds to frizziness but I am not 100 percent sure.</li>
            <li> Works well for my daughters hair</li>
            <li> Love it!  Easy to comb snarls out!</li>
            <li> Must have ..&lt;br /&gt;My daughter dosen&#x27;t even notice that I am brushing her hair!!&lt;br /&gt;It works so well that I use it as well!!!&lt;br /&gt;Light weight and durable!</li>
            <li> I LOVE the product.  We have issues when it comes to brushing my 2 year old hair.  She has a very sensitive head and hates tangles being brushed out.  I have used detangler sprays before but this brush detangled easily in just a few seconds no spray and little effort.  After bath time it was easy as well.  Even after sleeping, her rats nest didn&#x27;t seem as bad and then brushed out easily.  I really wanted to give this 5 stars since the product was so good BUT it has a spot on the side where it is already coming apart after 4 small brush sessions and less than 24 hours.... I would have like to have been a better made product.  That being said, I do love the product and my daughter is already happier about having her hair brushed so the positive outweighs the bad.</li>
            <li> Having to fight my daughter to brush her hair daily is very tiring. She has now taken ownership of brushing her hair daily. Love it!</li>
            <li> Kids love this brush! no problems at all, holds well, soft touch bristles and one happy child, thank you works great</li>
            <li> Great brush for little girls who are prone to nasty tangles. I would give it 5 stars, but the shape and size of it make it a bit awkward to hold. Other than that, we love it. No more tears from my 5yo when brushing the tangles out :)</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say its a &amp;#34;magical&amp;#34; brush like they imply, but it does work a lot better than any standard girls hairbrush.</li>
            <li> It works, but was not as amazing as I had hoped. Will continue searching for a good detangler brush for kids</li>
            <li> I like it, but my daughter won&#x27;t use it :-(&lt;br /&gt;She says it pulls her hair too much and hurts.</li>
            <li> Returned same day I received it- didn&#x27;t work on my child&#x27;s hair at all! She cried more than usual when I tried to brush her hair with it!</li>
            <li> I bought it for my granddaughter. She has beautiful long hair.It works wonderfully on her hair. She is five and doesn&#x27;t complain anymore about her hair being brushed.</li>
            <li> Nearly perfect. It is always a struggle when it comes to brushing my 7 year old daughters hair but this product has made the process go much smoother. It does take a little getting used to; however, it works and she doesn&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> According to my son who uses the product, it still hurts a little, but not as bad. He has curly hair and it was a nightmare before. This brush is great.</li>
            <li> Love love love this!!  My 3 yr old daughter has hair down to her bottom. Knots run rampant in our house! Especially after bathing and waking. I&#x27;m able to run the Knot Genie in her hair without the tears that often show up with brushing. I can even start at the too of her head and run it through down to the ends! Very effective in removing tangles!  We&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks now and let me tell you, my daughter is quick to tell you no other brush is going to touch her hair!  Comes in variety of cute colors and patterns. Pricier than some other brushes, but well worth the extra little bit to prevent my little girl crying. She now loves having her hair brushed!</li>
            <li> My daughter has curly hair.  We use a detangler and thought this would cause less pulling.  Not the case.  The brush is very flimsy and doesn&#x27;t work as advertised.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter has really thick hair and the Knot Genie Brush went right thru it.  I absolutely love it!  I found out about it when I took her to a local Snip-It childrens hair salon and they use it there.</li>
            <li> My granddaughters are always complaining when I want to brush their hair but this brush is great!&lt;br /&gt;It gets the tangles out very gently.</li>
            <li> Works great on wet hair but does tend to break dry hair. Overall a good purchase for my 3 year old with crazy curly hair.</li>
            <li> My daughters&#x27; hair range from super curly and thin to wavy and thick..they both hate the comb &amp; I hate them complaining about it but with this so far so good, it helps with the knots and helps with all the complaining.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first with some of the reviews; after years of fighting with my girls hair who wouldn&#x27;t be, right?  But, I am happy to say the positive reviews are right on, it really, REALLY helps get their hair smoothed out and looking great with little or no fuss, great product, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these after talking to a friend about her daughter&#x27;s hair and the pain it was to fight with the girls in the morning. It came within two days and that night we brushed our girls&#x27; hair with no complaints! My daughter loves brushing her hair with it and it looks great - she didn&#x27;t even complain when I used it to put her hair up for dance - a daily fight we always have.  It is definitely worth the expense! My daughter has thick straight hair, while my friend&#x27;s daughter has thinner curlier hair - it worked great for both girls!</li>
            <li> Works great on our daughter. She has very very curly/knotty/nappy hair :) But this works wonders. Only wish it had a handle.</li>
            <li> My girls were very skeptical at first, but are now searching this brush out every day. It really works great</li>
            <li> I bought this because my daughter has very thin and fine hair, which gets knotted if you just look at it. After reading the reviews on a number of detangling brushes this one seemed the best. When it arrived both my daughter and I were excited to try it out and to our surprise no crying or screaming at me that it hurt. The downfall, the brush is short lived. The bristles lose their firmness and every knot is felt. I&#x27;ve switched to the Marcel Mericer (sp) and so far so good. We&#x27;ve had it for about 3 and a half months now.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this, my four year old niece cries a good deal less while getting her hair brushed. You still have to be gentle with it, but it is better than a traditional brush.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this brush and it has made all the difference for my daughter. It used to be a battle to get her to brush her hair and now she takes the initiative. She has semi curly hair which gets knotted just by looking at it so this is a nice solution that doesn&#x27;t involve drenching her hair in de-tangler or conditioner.</li>
            <li> This actually works ! Would def recommend. My daughter even lets us do her hair now. Pretty simple design. But effective.</li>
            <li> My daughter wouldn&#x27;t tolerate a hair brush. This is small and easy, fits in the palm of her hand and she&#x27;s very comfortable using this little bug. It separates snags and tangles quickly and with little fuss. Definitely a worthwhile purchase.</li>
            <li> I got this brush for my neice. She has curly, knotty hair in the morning.  It slid through her hair much easier than any traditional brush and there were no tears!  A huge plus!</li>
            <li> This seemed like it was going to be the panacea to my daughter&#x27;s hair-combing aversion; alas, it was not. She still complains and, in fact, says it&#x27;s ouchier than her usual comb (perhaps all the spiky--though soft--teeth?). I use it myself from time to time and it&#x27;s fine. No miracle-worker, though.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 of these so far. I to keep one here for when my grand daughters visit, and one for each my grand daughters to have at their houses. It works right through knotted baby fine hair with little or no trauma to the little girls. I have also recommended purchasing one to my friends to have on hand for their grand daughters.</li>
            <li> My first grade child always complains when I try to brush her hair.  With this brush, we still use a little detangling spray, and then she can actually brush her own hair.  Because of the nature of it, it can take longer to get all the hair detangled, but is generally less hard on her scalp because hair is tugged less.</li>
            <li> Better than an average brush!  My granddaughter prefers this brush to all her other ones but it is a little hard for her to use.  I think it works as advertised!</li>
            <li> This brush is fantastic for one of my grand nieces who has very fine thin hair.  However, it would not budge my other grand niece&#x27;s hair which is very thick.  They are 3 and 4 years old, the 4 year old has the very thin hair.  So it helps very much, but I still need the detangling spray for both of them, whichever kind of brush I use.  This works wonders for the child with the thin hair.  But I suggest anyone who has the job of brushing out toddlers hair, use a de-tangling spray.  I use one from family dollar, it works well, but it takes alot if their hair has not been brushed out after the bath the night before, no matter how long or thick or thin the hair is. Both my grand nieces have long hair.</li>
            <li> Very useful.&lt;br /&gt;I use it to comb my long hair everyday.&lt;br /&gt;But it is a little too big,so that I can only use it at home.</li>
            <li> I initially thought that the bristles might be a little rough, but I tried it on my 2 year old anyway and was surprised at how quickly it worked! I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> My daughter hates having us brush her hair. She would do it but not the right way. So I found this and now she loves brushing her hair because it doesn&#x27;t hurt and I love it because it get tangles out with no complaints. quality item that I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This brush had reviews that it was amazing.  NOT TRUE!&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has straight hair that doesn&#x27;t have many tangles,&lt;br /&gt;and it will not go thru wet hair easily, and hurts in the process.&lt;br /&gt;A good old fashioned comb works way better than this expensive thing.</li>
            <li> Hair brushing, washing, anything - is a huge fight with my kids.  They truly hate it.  They are now 2 and almost 4.  I thought I&#x27;d try this as I found it on sale and it arrived this morning.  All I can say is, believe those great reviews - it actually works!!  It&#x27;s gentle.  It detangles.  It doesn&#x27;t cause any shouts of \\&quot;Mommmmy! Noooo!!\\&quot;, and in fact, both girls were happy to use it themselves.  The Teeny Genie is actually not that small. It&#x27;s still quite big for toddler hands.  My only recommendation would be for them to make an even smaller, Teeny Weeny Genie for toddler hands.  Very impressed and pleased.</li>
            <li> Did not work as advertised.  My girls with long hair were disappointed.  Found a brush called the wet brush that works wonderfully.  Nice to have no complaints when brushing kids hair.</li>
            <li> Everyone had such great reviews of this brush so I was hoping to love it. The bristles are hard and feel rough on the ends, like it would scratch your head. I tried it on my 3 year old who has long thin hair that gets knotted easily when wet. I didn&#x27;t find it to work any better than a regular brush &amp; I returned it.</li>
            <li> Brush doesn&#x27;t work well for very thick curly hair, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> My little one is 6 years old with thick, curly hair.  She won&#x27;t let me use anything else to do her hair.  She love it and wants another one to keep in our camper.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush.  Works great with granddaughters hair.  I love it.  Service was prompt and exactly waht I expected</li>
            <li> Very good, after washing hair or wet hair when using this comb, hair loss, decreased significantly.The price is still not close to the people</li>
            <li> Essentially the same as the Hair Bean (long and short plastic bristles to really get the tangles out), except this one has stiffer bristles, which gives a little more oomph, but also makes it scratchier.  From the brushER side, the Knot Genie has better potential, but from the brushEE side, my girls and I prefer the Hair Bean, by a long shot.  If you&#x27;re working on a tender head, go with the Hair Bean.  If you&#x27;re working on a My Little Pony, go with the Knot Genie.</li>
            <li> The bristles bend to much to actually remove the knots. When brushing, the bristles will bend to slide over the knot making the brush completely ineffective.</li>
            <li> Greatest thing ever made! No screaming, yelling, kicking and throwing things anymore, lol! Two girls and long hair? You need this thing!</li>
            <li> When the hair stylist was using this on my daughters hair and she didn&#x27;t make a peep, I came home and ordered this right away. She gets so many tangles and this really helps. Along with conditioner and no more tangles of course. Overall, I am very happy with this brush.</li>
            <li> great brush it gets the tangles out without pulling the hair. So easy to brush my 2 year old granddaughters hair</li>
            <li> I have two beautiful biracial daughters whose hair can be a nightmare... This brush is AMAZING at quickly getting through the tangles ... HOWEVER... i can hardly hold onto the brush and after no time it began to come apart so i would literally have to hold the top (pink part) together with the black (brush part)! Thought i may have just gotten a &amp;#34;bad brush&amp;#34; so i got a second one and the same thing happened. Why would you make a fantastic brush that comes apart?!?</li>
            <li> Makes providing hair care for my little one a breeze. I no longer have to chase him around the house every morning before daycare.</li>
            <li> I bought this after it was recommended on a mommy message board I am on. I was a little hesitant because I assumed that all brushes are the same. I was wrong! My squirmy three year old hates sitting still to have her hair brushed, so I always dreaded that chore. This brush makes combing through her hair so easy! It is fast and gets the knots out without hurting her. Even my teenage daughter uses it to get the tangles out of her long, thick, hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am recommending this to all of my friends with kids.</li>
            <li> I love this brush for my daughter&#x27;s super curly hair! You can hear it tugging to get the knots out, but she doesn&#x27;t cry anymore when I brush them out. I wish it was shaped differently so that I could use it to put her hair in a pony. But it does it&#x27;s job getting the knots out without a screaming fit!</li>
            <li> My 3 year-old daughter has beautiful curly hair, but it meant many mornings combing out tons of knots.  I saw the stylist where I get her hair cut using one of these and she told me I could use it on curly hair as long as my daughter&#x27;s hair was wet.  Instead of spending several minutes spraying tons of detangler and trying to gently comb out knots, I am done in like 30 seconds.  So much easier mornings!</li>
            <li> Not very impressed with this brush, cheap &amp; cheaply made. I&#x27;ve tried the detangler brush &amp; wet brush they are all light plastic and don&#x27;t really do much.</li>
            <li> I have a lot less breakage now and less pain while brushing my hair.  I got one to try so I could see if it would be worth it to try on my daughter when she has enough hair to use it.  Start at the root and this thing untangles your hair with very little effort or pain.  I&#x27;ll be buying my daughter one for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have been using this brush for a year now.  I still LOVE it.  I&#x27;ve used it in my wet and my dry hair.  I originally purchased to try one on myself before my daughter had long enough hair to brush and I&#x27;m back to purchase one for my daughter now.  A year later I don&#x27;t have any breaking on the brush and my hair has suffered very little breakage.  The brush cleans up very easily and looks like new still.  Highly highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Works great! Purchased for my 3 year old who is very tender and hates having hair messed with.  Works well for her!</li>
            <li> Better than a regular brush but it&#x27;s still not easy to brush through tangles. It also creates static due to the plastic bristles. However, it&#x27;s been better than the alternative.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this product because my 6 year old daughter has very easily-tangled hair, and I was desperate for anything that wouldn&#x27;t make her burst into tears while using.  I will admit that I didn&#x27;t quite use it as directed at first, and it did result in her backing away from it suspiciously, but when she tried it herself and got used to holding it the right way, it worked great!  And I cannot believe how shiny her hair looked after using it!  Her hair tends to have a dullest quality to it, and this brush not only worked out the tangles, but made her hair look so shiny and beautiful.  Practice make perfect with this product, but so far, I am pleased with its results!</li>
            <li> I was very excited about the idea of purchasing this product.  My granddaughter has curly hair and this brush did absolutely nothing different than a regular brush would do. We were very disappointed. It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Works great on wet hair helping my 7 year old comb her hair and avoid knots.  However, she wants to use it on dry hair as well.  Doesn&#x27;t work as well in dry hair.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used one on me and I was sold! Went on Amazon and bought 3! My adult daughter and I both love it, and my niece who is 8, no longer cries when her hip length hair gets brushed after a shampoo.  This is designed to be used on wet hair!!</li>
            <li> There are way better brushes out there.  This one did not work at all!  My daughter loves it--she&#x27;s 4 and calls it a princess brush, so she just likes it because it&#x27;s different and probably because it doesn&#x27;t get the tangles out.  I use a comb and normal brush when she&#x27;s not looking that does a better job!  My daughter has thicker, but very straight hair that gets really tangled.  It&#x27;s a gimmicky rip off!</li>
            <li> I bought the Knot Genie when it first came out.  The only flaw was that the colored piece separated from the brush.  You have to pop it back on each time you use it.  This may seem like a negative review but it works so well that I am willing to put up with the inconvenience.  I decided to finally contact the manufacturer and make them aware of a possible defect.  I emailed them late one night and received an email back in the morning.  They inquired on the make and wanted my address so they could send an identical one to me asap.  I believe these days that companies should receive feedback and be rewarded on excellent customer service.  I hope this review helps and lets you know that they truly stand behind their product and your satisfaction.</li>
            <li> I recommend this brush to everyone I know with a little girl and have started to ordered it as a present for a new baby girl.  This brush has eliminated the daily battle over hair brushing.  My little girl has shoulder length hair and is on fine.  It easily gets tangled.  At every hair cut I&#x27;ve asked the hair stylist to cut it to help with the tangles but there&#x27;s nothing they can do.  This brush solved all those problems.  It glides right through the hair.  The knots are easily removed with out a struggle.  I would often try to use a leave in detangler but it always left her fine hair looking dirty.  This brush doesn&#x27;t need a detangler so her hair stays cleaner longer.  I would recommend this brush to anyone with a daily hair battle.</li>
            <li> Perfectly awesome! This product was highly recommended by a patient and a pharmaceuticals rep at my workplace, when I had expressed my issue about my daughter&#x27;s hair being so curly and unruly!</li>
            <li> Got this for my grand daughter who hates her hair brushed. She is now able to brush her own hair without problems. We are also able to brush her hair with little or no crying.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my little girl, who doesn&#x27;t have much hair yet. So, I tried it out on my long curly hair and it really did work wonders. I would recommend this to any type of hair.</li>
            <li> It works &amp; my kids like using it.  Size is a little big, may need a smaller one for travel but a lot less tears!</li>
            <li> I have 3 young granddaughters.  It was always a struggle to brush their hair due to knots.  Now they don&#x27;t argue or whine, they actually comb their hair without my help.</li>
            <li> Worked reasonably well and better than combing alone.</li>
            <li> Love this product! My girls do not want me using any other brush, they love this thing!!</li>
            <li> My daughter (3yo) has always hated having her hair combed.  This thing is amazing.  I can hear it going through the tangles, but it brushes right through without hurting her.  She still won&#x27;t always let me brush her hair, but it&#x27;s so much better since I got this.  Plus I don&#x27;t have any guilt about potentially hurting her!</li>
            <li> My daughter has very THICK hair, and she doesn&#x27;t like to comb it, so it becomes very snarled and unbearable.  This brush is the one she is willing to use to brush her hair out, and she doesn&#x27;t seem to complain about the knots as much as she does when using other brushes!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t work any better than a regular brush.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t help at all ... had to get my daughters hair cut short</li>
            <li> Got two of these last year, one for each of my granddaughters, one with very fine hair and one thick and curly. The only hairbrush either of then will use, really works, no more tangles!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very impressed with this. It&#x27;s not nearly as good as the one we tried in the kids&#x27; salon. It feels like the plastic is cheaply made and is pretty rough on my daughter&#x27;s head. It does detangle more gently than a regular brush, but it&#x27;s not worth your money.</li>
            <li> Read about it in a magazine.  Bought two for my GF.  She thought I was crazy.  Then she tried it.  She is no longer in pain when she brush her curls.  No more ripping hair off her head.  She is a believer now.</li>
            <li> This does work fairly well. I wasn&#x27;t sure when buying and then when I got it the bristles seemed very short and easy to break but my daughter loves this brush. It&#x27;s a great brush for younger kids with lots of tangles</li>
            <li> My daughter hates getting her hair brushed. This brush has made it a little less painful for her. Works very well with wet hair.</li>
            <li> If you have a child that cries at every session with a brush, you need this brush or a variation of it.  The tapered and flexible pins do not snag the hair like most brushes do.  It is honestly the only way I can get through my daughters thick, straight hair without a lot of tears and drama. I had heard about this brush on a parenting message board and couldn&#x27;t wait to get one.  It was worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have the Goody brand one, and that works well too...about the same as this one and it costs less...I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in quality.</li>
            <li> Seems hard to believe, but this little brush is a miracle worker on snarls and tangled hair. My daughter has long wavy hair and it gets very tangled up. I would spend time every evening after she conditioned, working through the knots with a comb and detangle spray. It was painful and never any fun. She now uses this brush herself and gets amazingly tangle free hair. It works! Worth the $$ for sure!!!</li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly hair and my stylist used this on me before my latest wash and cut. Loved it so much, I had to go and get my own. Would recommend for everyone who has hair that tangles easily, or who have sensitive scalps.</li>
            <li> As a dad of two toddler daughters (4 &amp; 2) this has been a life saver. My only regret is not finding out about this sooner and using standard combs for so long. We bought a 2nd one to have in multiple locations.</li>
            <li> I have been combing my Daughters hair with a detangle comb for the last 3 years.  We put leave in conditioner and spray detangle spray in her hair every time we comb her hair.  With her curly hair it would take 15 minutes and she would complain of the pain every time.  I got this brush in hopes of helping the situation.  It&#x27;s just amazing how well this brush works.  I combed her hair in less then 5 minutes now and not once does she complain. I wish I would have discovered this years ago.  My wife even tried it and she said she was going to have to get one for herself.  When my daughter gets a bit older and combs her own hair I&#x27;m going to have to buy the smaller one for her since this ones a bit big for her hand.  Other then that I highly recommend this brush and you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> My daughter was always crying when her hair was brushed so I decided to try one of these.  She thinks it is wonderful and it is her preferred hair brush.  I don&#x27;t like that it doesn&#x27;t have a handle so when I go to fix her hair I use a brush with a handle.  But as far as just getting the tangles out beforehand, this works really well.</li>
            <li> This brush does pull. It is just an ordinary brush . Don&#x27;t waste your money on brush that won&#x27;t do anything</li>
            <li> I think it is great, but I do not not notice a HUGE difference in less pain. It detangles great though.</li>
            <li> I was so looking forward to this and now that we got it, it&#x27;s not worth it.  My daughter still hates having her hair brushed and it did not do anything different than her regular hairbrush.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews of this brush very skeptically, but given the low cost of the brush I ordered one anyway. It actually works just like everyone describes... it&#x27;s the first brush I&#x27;ve used on my daughter&#x27;s hair that can detangle dry hair. No more wetting hair, no more detangling spray, no more only getting the tangles out right after bath time. It&#x27;s such a fantastic brush!</li>
            <li> I bought this about a year ago. I have long hair and so does my 5 year old. It doesn&#x27;t work any better than any other brush I&#x27;ve ever used. Still hurts just the same and doesn&#x27;t get knots/tangles out any easier.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was tired of the hair brushing battle. My daughters would be crying as I struggled to comb out the knots. This brush does exactly what it promises. My daughters do not have super thick or really knotty hair, so I don&#x27;t know how it works on that type of hair, but for their hair, it&#x27;s perfect. It&#x27;s easy for a child or adult to hold and use.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old daughter has long fine hair that gets very tangled during bathtime.  She used to scream when we brushed her hair, but with this brush, she never complains and it has made bathtime in our house much more relaxed.</li>
            <li> To be fair, it&#x27;s my fault for believing that a brush could have some magical quality to it, but after reading the glowing reviews, I honestly expected some technological advance to exist in this brush that helped detangle hair. Sadly, no. It&#x27;s a wire brush. It&#x27;s this odd shape, which makes it ok for adults, but hard for my kids (2 and 4) to hold and brush by themselves. The brush part is just plastic. There are no little rounded tips on the bristles, so my children complain if this runs over their ears and neck - which is frequently, give it&#x27;s large brushing surface area. And they&#x27;re right. It does hurt. I have noticed no difference at all using this or the &amp;#34;wet brush&amp;#34; - another overhyped brush that is nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My best detangling solution is using a small amount of Chi silk serum in wet hair or J&amp;J detangling spray in dry hair. Perhaps, someday, a new brush will be designed that truly does end the days of hair brushing tears, but this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> Nice brush for baby girl&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> Amazing at removing knots.  I use it on my 14-month-old&#x27;s hair and she loves it.  She has even taken to brushing her hair herself! Highly recommend it for little ones with fine hair.</li>
            <li> Finally! Now I can brush my girls hair without the screaming. This is a wonderful well constructed invention, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> BEST THING EVER! Grand daughter 4 crys while you do her hair no matter how her hair is extremely sensitive this was a mini miracle! she brushes her own hair too. cant believe it actually works!</li>
            <li> It still hurts my daughter to brush out the large tangles, but it works well otherwise. She prefers it so much more than a regular brush, and I am glad to no longer hear her whine or cry every time I brush her hair. I recommend it to anyone who has a little girl that cries when you brush her hair. Haven&#x27;t seen any tears since I started to use it.</li>
            <li> The quality is very poor. It is not what I expected. It is not comfortable for using and hurt your hair. Be careful.</li>
            <li> Bought for my three-year-old daughter&#x27;s very fine soft hair. it&#x27;s better than a traditional brush but we still have to be careful for tangles however it is hard to manage and would be much easier if it was a little smaller in size and had a handle</li>
            <li> Great brush! Does exactly what it says. Would buy again. Daughter loves using it as well. Best buy so far!</li>
            <li> I love this brush!! My two year old absolutely hates to have her hair brushed. She will actually hide any hair brush she can get her hands on. If she sees me coming with a brush in hand, she will run and hide. With the Knot Genie I can hide the brush in my palm and brush her hair before she has a chance to run away. Brushing is so much faster with the Knot Genie!! What took 1-2 minutes to brush, I can now complete in seconds. One stroke brushes the top, middle and bottom of hair. My daughter actually doesn&#x27;t mind having her hair brushed with the Knot Genie!!! If I use another type of brush she screams and hides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the purchase of this item, everything went very smooth. The item arrived earlier than expected. The Knot Genie was exactly what is shown in the image and works as said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a mother of two girls, I know how painful the hair brushing experience can be, for the child and the mother. I highly recommend this product for children. It does not work so well on my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my 6 year old granddaughter, who has very fine, easily tangled hair. It is the only hairbrush she lets her mom use now.</li>
            <li> My 9 yo daughter loves it NO MORE TEARS brushing her long hair.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my daughter who has VERY curly hair and absolutely hates getting her hair brushed. This worked perfectly for her. Now she is willing to let even daddy brush her hair. The construction of this product is average, this size of the product fits in a large hand but is manageable for smaller hands. The only down side of this is that the brush part and the pink backing can come apart fairly easily if dropped but it pops right back on. A little glue on the shell to the brush portion will fix that no problem. All in all the results are amazing. I would definitely recommend this product if your kiddo does not like getting her hair brushed.</li>
            <li> My Granddaughters just love it; no more fighting with their hair their mom&#x27;s tell me.  Fits in their hands easily.</li>
            <li> Love this brush for our daughter who hates to brush her hair.  She is 5 and has long thin hair that gets easily tangled during the day and during sleep.  This brush is gentle enough for her not to scream and yet still gets the knots out of her hair.</li>
            <li> This item comes in two sizes, the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; sized &amp;#34;Knot Genie&amp;#34; and the smaller sized &amp;#34;Teeny Genie.&amp;#34;  We ordered what we thought was the larger one and we received the smaller one.  We were disappointed, as there is nothing in the product listing to indicate that it is the smaller version.  Other than that, the product seems to be fine and it arrived on or before the day it was promised.</li>
            <li> Only brush my nieces will use because it doesn&#x27;t hurt their head (:</li>
            <li> My daughter was 4 when I got this and it has been a lifesaver.  MUST HAVE FOR SINGLE US DADS!!!!!!</li>
            <li> i got this as a vday present from my boyfriend i have long thick curly hair and i love it it is nice does what it says so well,yes it will take a little getting use to how to brush your hair with it ,Most people do not treat there hair right, so i think learning that to the people that have bad experiances with it cause it has been so much better with it,</li>
            <li> Maybe I was expecting miracles, but this thing is just ok. It does work slightly better than a normal brush and though I wanted to rave about it, I think it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li> My child&#x27;s hair is always a tangled mess when she wakes up.  I bought this brush along with Marrakesh X Dreamsicle Leave-In Treatment and Detangler and the two products have made detangling my daughter&#x27;s very long hair a breeze.  A couple sprays of the conditioner and a few swipe of the brush and no more tangles.  Brushing my daughter&#x27;s hair is now a quick and painless process.</li>
            <li> works pretty well. Still some pain if lots of knots. But kids really like them and that alone is a big help.</li>
            <li> I returned this brush the same day I received it-it pulled my child&#x27;s hair and didn&#x27;t work at all. I ended up purchasing another brush that worked much better.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve bought many brushes for our childs sensitive scalp. This was by far the most gentle and easy to use. It really does get through the tangles easier than a brush with nobs and hooks at the ends.</li>
            <li> This is like a miracle. My granddaughter has long very fine hair that snarls and tangles in the slightest breeze.  And regular combs and brushes are painful and end up tearing her hair..  this brush just glides through the tangles as if they weren&#x27;t there and best of all, her hair shines as if it has been polished.</li>
            <li> Great brush it is so loved by my granddaughter. so glad this product is out there for all who have hair problems</li>
            <li> This is genius. My daughter never fights me when I use this brush and she even wants to herself now (she is 16 months). I use it on my boys too. I loved it so much I gave it as Christmas gifts to friends who have girls - they loved it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about this brush. It&#x27;s not much but plastic bristles. My child however, complains less when I use it but still not justified with the price.</li>
            <li> Works well. Granddaughter with sensitive scalp is very happy!</li>
            <li> This did not work at all on my daughter&#x27;s hair.  Every morning is a screaming fit about brushing hair.  I was hoping this was going to be the magical answer but she still screams and cries and says it hurts just as bad as all the other brushes.  Boo!</li>
            <li> My daughters have relatively straight hair, one with somewhat coarse hair and another with pretty fine hair. This thing is basically a brush. It&#x27;s not magical, it&#x27;s a brush. It works about as well as.. a brush. I don&#x27;t know what I expected. Actually, I do -- I expected something that would work better than a brush. So I am disappoint, just a little.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my grandaughter she loves it. It doesn&#x27;t pull her hair even when it is wet. Works when her hair is dry also.</li>
            <li> This is the first product I&#x27;ve been able to use on my middle child&#x27;s hair that allows me to comb from root to tip.  It&#x27;s been great.  The only thing I would change is I would add a handle.  It often slips out of my hand when I&#x27;m combing my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> My 9 year old daughter says its still pulls her hair a little bit however it&#x27;s better than a standard brush.</li>
            <li> small little brush for the detangled hair, Quality is very cheap for the price though !</li>
            <li> does the job but i ended up getting the tangle teezer for my 4 year old and use this myself because the hard bristles hurt her scalp.  it does work better than a standard brush though.</li>
            <li> Some friends recommended this to me. My daughter found it fun and easy to use. I have recommended it to a few friends of mine already.</li>
            <li> I saw this advertised in a &amp;#34;Parents&amp;#34; magazine while waiting to see the doctor.  I was skeptical but decided to try this.  Surprisingly this works so well my grand daughter who used to cry and fuss as her mom tried to comb out her hair tangles now turns to her mother and says &amp;#34;That&#x27;s it? I&#x27;m done?&amp;#34;  I ordered the pink she has named it her Ladybug brush.</li>
            <li> love this comb works so well on my daughter super long hair and is great for tangles</li>
            <li> Melhor escova para cabelo</li>
            <li> Well, my daughter will finally let me brush her hair so I&#x27;ll give it 5-stars. It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t do any deep brushing, but it get through some of the knots without tears so...</li>
            <li> My 4 year old has very long hair and it is such a hassle to brush out her hair. This has simplified the process, even though she still complains some. Would be a little more convenient if it had a handle of some sort.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a 7 year old grand-daughter with that baby fine waist long hair. Boy did I get in trouble lol. I wish I had picked a more neutral color because her brother loves it and said it felt good, Before school the three kids get themselves dressed and groomed. Then their mom has them line up on the barstools with their hair and tooth brushes to double check. My grand daughter had this so caught up in her hair her mom thought she would have to cut it out. Armed with a spray bottle with diluted cream rinse and another brush she got it quickly enough, but the brush has been banished to the toy chest to assist barbie and the gang. She has never had a brush quite this tangled up but you know kids. I learned the cream rinse trick from a good friend that has a grandchild with that black nappy super fine\curly hair. The trick is to start at the bottom using small sections. Back of the ear forward on each side then three sections for the back. Work your way up spraying as you go holding onto the hair so it doesn&#x27;t pull at the scalp when you get to the crown area put your hand on their head and have them press against your hand as you brush if it hurts tell them to press harder against your hand.  Once you get a section completely free braid it so it doesn&#x27;t tangle. With my girls I used to pull the side braids together at the back and secure with a small elastic and pull the back braids over before undoing them. Instant head band and no more lunch in their hair. This brush would probably rate 5 stars if an adult were using it. It is a bit too cumbersome for tiny hands.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 12 and for 11 years we have fought over brushing her curly hair (uh, she was bald for the first year). Her hair gets terrible snarly nests and we&#x27;ve often resorted to cutting out chunks of hair because it was hopeless to try to untangle them. Believe it or not, this brush works. I was skeptical upon opening it because it has these wimpy-looking tiny plastic spines. They&#x27;re flexible, so I thought there was no way they would be strong enough to work through her hair. But... they do. With minimal discomfort. Yes, once in a while we&#x27;ll get a knot that will make her whimper, but before she was screaming bloody murder and covering her head with both arms while begging me to just cut off all her hair. So, if that scene sounds at all familiar to you, you should totally try this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, for you curly girls, we pair this with AG Fast Food leave-in hair conditioner and it helps keep those knots from forming in the first place. We brush while wet (otherwise she turns into a puffy, fuzzy duckling). BTW, my daughter has non-ethnic, type 3A curls.</li>
            <li> We have several older Knot Genie brushes that had worn down over time.  My kids loved those brushes.  You can still store clips and bobby pins inside, which is super helpful, but they made the bristles more rigid and almost sharp than before.  My kids really disliked these - unfortunately, I bought two we can&#x27;t use.  I checked locally and they all seem to be this way, so my guess is they just changed them.  We ended up buying something else to use instead.</li>
            <li> Love the Fairy Pink detangling brush.  Easy for Mom to use and the best part is my daughter loves it and it&#x27;s easy for her to use.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this brush for our daughter&#x27;s hair every morning, they absolutely love it. Truth be told, I occasionally use it for my beard as well :)</li>
            <li> My 2 and 7yr olds hated brushing their hair, it was always a fight and usually ended in tears.  Now all I have to do is ask and it&#x27;s done.  This brush is amazing - hair looks nice and there are no tears!!</li>
            <li> My daughter hates having her hair brushed. I have tryed everything to stop tangles, but no conditioner or detangler could help. Finally we found the Knot Genie. No more tears. She loves brushing her hair!</li>
            <li> This is not for people with curly hair. My kids scream more with this brush then the one I had used before. The bristles on the brush do not give. And it scratched my kids back as I brush their hair. Very disappointed!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Brush detangles hair painlessly, that&#x27;s what I bought it for &amp; that&#x27;s exactly what it does. Purchased it as an add on so the price was right.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think we could get through a morning without this little marvel of hair untangling goodness.  It does just what it says it will do.  What they don&#x27;t tell you is it will spare you hours upon hours of dagger throwing glares from your daughters, screaming and emotional trauma associated with hair brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knot Genie may not come out of a bottle, but Knot Genie is a life saver around here!</li>
            <li> This is a lifesaver. My daughter still doesn&#x27;t like having her hair combed, but this has made it much better</li>
            <li> Seemed like it would be easier to use. my 6 year old can&#x27;t fit her hand around it to comb her own hair. the bristles bend very easily also.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this brush after reading about it in a magazine and reading the reviews here. Daily hair brushing is a nightmare for my almost 4 year old. We were very anxious to get the brush and she was asking every day if the \\&quot;magic brush\\&quot; was here. It finally arrived today and it is a piece of junk, I didn&#x27;t even want to grace it with one star. Would not brush through the hair and leaves it full of static. Forget about brushing through wet hair, it won&#x27;t, tried it after bath time thinking maybe that was when we would see the magic happen. I tried on my own hair and it couldn&#x27;t even brush through it. Very very disappointed, save your time and money on this one.  Wishing I could make a wish and have this \\&quot;knot genie\\&quot; disappear and get my money back.</li>
            <li> No crying or running away by my curly-haired two year old!  She likes to have it in the tub with her, and it collects water inside. But it&#x27;s easy to take apart and empty out.</li>
            <li> Best dog brush. Works well on long haired dogs</li>
            <li> My 2 daughters thank me every day for purchasing the knot genie.  No more fussing when brushing their long hair.  Local salon was selling for $15...got on Amazon for $10.</li>
            <li> Soft and gentle, and effective on both cat and dog...</li>
            <li> My daughter has extremely curly hair and brushing her hair was a daily battle before this brush came along. This is seriously life changing for me.</li>
            <li> This looks like a cheap piece of infomercial crap.  But what do you know, it works exactly as advertised.  We have no more hair pulling drama with our toddler, and that makes it worth it.</li>
            <li> We won&#x27;t use any other brushes.  My kids have very knotty hair, and this has been wonderful for them.  It just hurts less than other brushes.</li>
            <li> Be aware, this is a junk brush. Why? Because it&#x27;s made like a box--the black bottom covers like a cap the red shell. In a month, the \\&quot;box\\&quot; opens permanently and you cannot close it anymore, so you will end up with nothing. Also the price is  too high for this brush. I bough a real one brush, with fine bristles for $4 at the nearby ***mart store.</li>
            <li> This brush works great on my 5 year olds hair. When i bought it my daughter had long curly hair but then i cut it about 5 or so inches and the curl didn&#x27;t come back. So it now works wonders but before it didn&#x27;t get through all of her thick curly hair!</li>
            <li> It detangles the top layer of hair, yet after a week of use I noticed a rats nest under the top smooth hair on my daughters head.  It took 25 painful kicking screaming minutes to get out the rats nest that was hidden underneath.  That was even with conditioner and leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is amazing! Normally, I have to pull and tug at messy, knotty hair in order to brush it after a shower. Only one time did my daughter say ouch. ONCE! That&#x27;s a miracle in our house. I would buy this again if it gets lost. However, it doesn&#x27;t work as well on dry hair, so don&#x27;t buy it for that, but it&#x27;s not advertised for dry hair.</li>
            <li> I cannot fully express how amazing this brush is! My daughter has had very unruly hair from birth that would tangle and get knots very easily. It was a nightmare to care for it! I would use conditioning shampoo, a deep conditioner, a leave-in conditioner and the detangling spray before I would even attempt to comb it. I had heard about the Knot Genie and finally decided to break down and order it. The second I opened the package, I decided to put it to the ultimate test and brush my daughter&#x27;s hair after she had been at school the whole day. To my surprise, the brush went right through her hair with no pulling, and even better no screaming! I could not believe it! It has cut down our brushing time to a couple of minutes - tops! In addition to it brushing through the knotty mess, it left her hair smooth and super shiny. I immediately told everyone I know about this brush, and will continue to sing its&#x27; praises!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter (2) let&#x27;s me use this on her hair sometimes but it&#x27;s plasticky bristles pulls at her curly hair and splits her ends. It is nice for her scalp but doesn&#x27;t work any better than other brushes at trying to get her to let me brush her hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is, but my 5 year old gets some gnarly tangles in her hair.  This brush is awesome.  She can now brush her hair on her own without ripping her hair out!</li>
            <li> This thing is like magic!  Brushes through my daughter&#x27;s tangly hair without any tears from her.  Awesome.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 2 and  has spiral curly hair and knots up everyday .....this brush is awesome. She actually sits and let&#x27;s me brush her hair</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness, they should call this the Miracle Brush! We were given this brush as a baby gift before my toddler was born. She was slow to grow hair and just recently has grown her hair long enough to tangle. She has baby fine hair with a medium curl that tangles on the back of her head, where her head touches the bed when she sleeps. About a month ago, hair brushing started becoming a challenge because of the tangles, even when we used a detangler and brushed very gently. I remembered that we had the Knot Genie hair brush and had my husband find it. Wow, what a difference a hair brush can make- literally no tears, no crying, no complaints, no detangler required! I&#x27;m planning to buy another one, just in case we can&#x27;t find our current Knot Genie.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 5-yr old for Christmas.  She has thick, wavy hair so I was so hoping that this brush would live up to it&#x27;s name.  It is working wonderfully for her and now she doesn&#x27;t mind brushing her hair! In the past it was a struggle to get her to brush her hair, she would pull her head away, tear up, etc.  This has made it so much easier to keep her hair looking nice!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing for toddlers.  My 3 year old toddler has wavy hair and every time I would give her a bath, I would have to saturate her hair in conditioner to brush out the tangles with a wide tooth plastic comb.  I would always hear &amp;#34;ouch.&amp;#34;  Well, I tried this comb and it glided through her hair effortlessly and painlessly.  It took less than a minute to de-tangle her hair as opposed to 10 minutes with a regular comb.  I also tried this brush on my hair.  I have naturally curly hair.  Again, it performed amazingly...no pain and no effort.  However, because my hair is curly, I would not use this brush regularly as ANY brush causes my hair to frizz more (even though I dry it with a bonnet type of dryer and leave in most of the conditioner).  So for my hair, I will stick to just using my fingers.</li>
            <li> We had ordered the Teeny Genie and got this, which is a behemoth-sized palm fit, so the Littles can&#x27;t hold it very well, and it&#x27;s even large for my hand.  But, ok, working with what we have, we tried it.  Super-sensitive head of the older Little STILL does not like to get hair brushed, so I see no benefit.  We&#x27;ll stick with the detangling spray and a soft-base, soft-tip nylon bristle brush.</li>
            <li> I got this for my girls....I have since purchased one for myself. I have VERY thick and wavy hair...this brush is amazing.</li>
            <li> Bought for our 3 year old Granddaughter, I thought it would help in detangling her hair.  She used it once or twice and did not use there after.  She did not like the shape of the brush or the feeling.</li>
            <li> This brush is as good as advertised! It really helps to get the tangles out without my daughter being too uncomfortable! One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made in awhile.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Knot Genie after hearing some other moms talk about it and how well it worked on their daughter&#x27;s hair.  My 3 year old has long, naturally wavy hair.  It&#x27;s constantly tangled!  (she twists it a lot!)  It&#x27;s usually a struggle to comb her hair after bathtime, despite the leave-in conditioner and/or tangle spray I use.  The Knot Genie did a very good job of getting through her hair without pulling and yanking as much as a regular comb or brush.  The reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because there was a long period of time where she would say &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t want that one&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;m not sure if she didn&#x27;t like it or if she was just being stubborn (which is very possible!)  But she has recently chosen this one again to be used after bath.  I think this is a keeper!  I also have an 18 month old and she lets me use this on her with no problem.</li>
            <li> My 1st grade daughter asked me to write this review so that other people arent disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has the type of hair that always seems to look tangled and unbrushed 5 minutes after a thorough brushing, even with good conditioner (long, strong hair but not thick).  The detangling process is very time consuming and accompanied by tears and screaming.  This brush seemed like the answer to our prayers - not only would it detangle but no tears, no screaming and she could brush her own hair.  My daughter was excited to be able to have her hair brushed without my help or having it hurt.  NOT the case.  The knot genie only detangled the top layer of hair, leaving a rats nest beneath.  When trying to navigate through the tangles after only 1 week of use the bristles bent and became distorted. Trying to untangle the mess beneath took as much, if not more, time than we took without the knot genie.  I just wish we hadnt kept giving it a chance and returned it when we had the opportunity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may be an okay brush if there arent serious tangles to deal with but frankly, that is what this product is made for so for us it totally missed the mark.</li>
            <li> This brush is great. Brush through daughters long thick hair with no fuss. Finally can brush hair without her crying and running away.</li>
            <li> Thus came quickly, the works great with my daughters long thing easily tangled hair....no crying and she is 5 and can brush her own hair with this brush.</li>
            <li> my daughter loves how that brush doesn&#x27;t hurt but also when she is in the bath my daughter doesn&#x27;t feel any pain. highly recommend .</li>
            <li> I found out about Knot Genie 2 years ago, i already had a light blue one but decided to get a new color. The first one  lasted me for about a year. I only got rid of it becuase i wanted a new one. I use it for my daughter&#x27;s hair which is really curly, this brush help with combing and defining her curls evern more. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Works great but its big, hard to hold in my hand and there is no way a child could do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish i had ordered the mini one</li>
            <li> I took this out of the box, and was totally disappointed. It couldn&#x27;t have cost .50 to make this. Horrible design, and cheaply made. The bristles are stiff and don&#x27;t easily move. Just to put the brissle to the palm of my hand it was uncomfortable much less combing my 5 year old&#x27;s hair. HECK NO!!!! Pass on this product for you or your childs sake.</li>
            <li> I first found this brush when I took my 3 year old for a hair cut. The hairdresser used it on her and she didn&#x27;t have a fit, unlike when I brushed her hair with a normal brush at home. So of course, I bought one. At first she and her sister didn&#x27;t scream when I brushed their hair with it but they must have figured out it wasn&#x27;t fun that way so now they scream again, but it&#x27;s just not as bad as it used to be. I really do think the brush works though, because we recently left it at a hotel so I used a regular brush on them and you would have thought I was pulling their hair out. So I bought another one and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Yeah it takes out the tangles, but I find the width of the brush makes it awkward to hold. It does its job. But so do other brushes.</li>
            <li> Makes the mornings soooo much easier :) I would suggest for curly or straight hair! Its a must in our house</li>
            <li> I never ever thought I&#x27;d have a smiling child when it came to hairbrushing time. No matter how gentle we&#x27;ve been, it was just not enough, until now.  My child even VOLUNTARILY brushes her hair!</li>
            <li> The only brush I&#x27;ve tried that works. Didn&#x27;t hurt my daughters head at all and she actually asked me to keep brushing it! She is 4 and has really long hair and took no time to brush through it all. Great product!</li>
            <li> I purchased a pink knot genie and also a blue one for my daughter and I. I have long straight hair and my daughter has curly medium length hair. I had high hopes for these especially since they are $20.00 per brush. I didn&#x27;t get them on Amazon unfortunately. Anyways these worked worse than the cheapest drugstore brush I have ever bought. First off they are very hard to hold. They are shaped weird and just hard to grip. Completely not functional as a brush. They are cheap plastic and the bristles are hard and hurt. Next off is the fact that they do not detangle at all. I brushed my hair first and it was a horrible experience. It was hard to hold the brush, it hurt a lot and it didn&#x27;t detangle my hair at all. After I was finished torturing myself I pulled my hair into a ponytail and lo and behold I see short pieces and chunks of hair sticking up all over my head. The Knot Genie broke my hair off all over my head!!!!! It looks horrible. Obviously I&#x27;m not even going to try this on my daughter&#x27;s hair after what it did to mine! Please do not buy this!!!! I ususally do not write many reviews, but feel so strongly against this product after trying it that I was compelled to do so. I wrote the company about my experience and their reply was, \\&quot;Really, we&#x27;re sorry you feel that way.\\&quot; Can you even belive it? What horrible customer service! Do not buy this brush!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have fine, curly hair. With this I have a lot less breakage. My hair is smooth and feels healthier.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical of this product when I first saw it.  However we were at the point were my daughter hatef having her curly hair combed because of all of her tangles.  Now we use this comb everynight and she doesn&#x27;t mind anymore.  It is comfortable to hold in my hand and just glides through her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are sure to spray a detangler first because without that it wouuldn&#x27;t work quite as smoothly.  It works so much better than any other comb or brush I have tried.  Give it a try if you dread hair combing as much as I used to.</li>
            <li> My daughter really dislikes this brush. The bristles are hard and hurt her scalp. The brush is a weird shape and I inevitably always end up dropping it because it slips out of my hand due to its shape. It does a so-so job with tangles. I am currently shopping for a different brush.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very corse thick hair and this brush actually works to detangle it without making her scream and cry. I wish I found it sooner. I wish it had a handle because I always end up with conditioner all over my hands, but I still give it five stars.</li>
            <li> Daughter loves this!  She happily brushes her hair!</li>
            <li> Works great with my toddler, who does not like to sit still and have her hair yanked.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really work that well my hair or my daughter&#x27;s. You&#x27;re better off using a rounded brush. It just gets stuck in her hair. At least it comes apart so you can store your extra hair-ties inside of it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 3yo niece who has long tangle-prone hair. Worked wonders on her!</li>
            <li> This works fabulous on my long, thick, wavy hair! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone!!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush because hair brushing was becoming a real battle.  My daughter had seen a commercial for this and begged me to get it.  I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt.  I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s okay simply because my daughter didn&#x27;t fight me as much when I used this brush.  I personally didn&#x27;t think it did any better at getting knots out without pain.</li>
            <li> This really is a great brush, works just as it says - doesn&#x27;t tug on hair at all.  I ended up not being able to use it on my child&#x27;s hair because it&#x27;s curly and just made her hair one big pouf but it DID go through all the tangles painlessly.  Would definitly recommend for straight hair!</li>
            <li> My four year old daughter did not say ouch once the whole time I brushed her hair. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this! Would totally recommend this!!!!  My youngest daughter &amp; I have long hair, live in a hard water state. This gets the knots out pain free! Amazing! I straightened my hair for the first times in months!</li>
            <li> I use it when my daughters hair is wet only. She has shorter straight hair that really doesn&#x27;t even tangle much, but if I try to use it on her hair dry it does nothing. A regular brush and a wider tooth comb would have been a better investment for us. Just overall not impressed at all. Would not buy again or recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these, one for my friend and sister.  The both were amazed at how well it worked, and for 10$ it is a bargain.</li>
            <li> There is nothing magical about the knot genie brush. It doesn&#x27;t de-tangle my daughter&#x27;s hair at all. The bristles are so flexible that when they encounter a knot, they just bend and go around it. The upside is that my daughter seems to like the brush, so we use it after I have combed the tangles out.</li>
            <li> My young daughter has fine, long hair that tangles easily. She loves this brush. It&#x27;s too big for her hands, though, so she can&#x27;t use it herself yet. I&#x27;ve dropped it quite a few times myself because it doesn&#x27;t have a handle. It comes apart in two pieces, but even my daughter can get it back together again easily.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work.  My daughter has very curly fine hair.  It was a little hard to get through her hair at first, but once we got the hang of it and started at the end and worked up, it went well.  Took me about 5 minutes to get through all her hair.  I&#x27;ve NEVER been able to comb/brush through ALL of her hair.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Not as great as i expected based on other&#x27;s feedback but it works.  I guess I was expecting a lot...it is just a brush.  :)</li>
            <li> This is generally a good brush. My daughter is mixed so her hair is very curly. This is the first real brush I have used on her hair (she&#x27;s 24mo) so I can&#x27;t really compare. I would only advise that it often falls out of my hand while brushing. It isn&#x27;t the worst thing but it is annoying!</li>
            <li> My 5 year old twins hate getting their hair brushed and once I got this brush, all tears have ceased.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Bought this for both my daughters, who had awful knots after washing and they both said it works great.  The only thing is not to push to hard near the scalp or it will hurt.  Otherwise works for detangling without pain</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that wants to form ringlets and twists all the time and can get all tangled up. I use this sometimes when I get out of the shower, after I&#x27;ve sprayed leave-in conditioner and detangler on my hair, and I also use this when I have next-day dry hair and I need to brush it out for a bun or other up-do. It really, really works! Most brushes hurt and make my hair frizzier, this does not hurt, is easy to use and cuts down on the frizz too. You do have to start at the scalp and brush down, don&#x27;t try to work up from the ends like you would with regular brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love it. Works much better then a comb or brush. My daughter has long thick hair and everyday she hates to get her hair brushed. The Knot Genie makes life a bit eaiser. Thanks:)</li>
            <li> I am so surprised! I tried this because my daughter (and myself) have curly and very tangled hair.  She cries EVERY night when I brush her hair.  I got this in the mail about 20 minutes ago.  I was anxious to try it because it looks so simple.  I tried it right on a tangled spot on her DRY hair and to my amazement there was no pulling!!  Just went right through the knots in one stroke!</li>
            <li> My daughter inherited my sensitive scalp, and always makes a fuss about having her hair brushed, so my mother-in-law sent us one of these.  When I tried to use it on my daughter, she made a louder fuss than usual.  I kept trying and she kept balking, so I finally tried it on myself.  OUCH indeed!  The individual bristles are SHARP and kind of raked over my scalp.  I hated it too.  We didn&#x27;t really care if it took out tangles, as it hurt our heads too much to use anyway.  Refund city.</li>
            <li> The smaller size of this one works great when my daughter wants to comb her own hair- and mine! It&#x27;s small enough to fit in her hand and the comb works great! It brushes hair without the issue of hitting knots constantly. Which is great for brushing her hair and even better when she plays with my hair and then brushes it. Much less painful for both of us!</li>
            <li> Great brush I love it. I ordered the pink and was sent a green camo one instead. My little girl was disappointed.</li>
            <li> My daughter hates having her hair brushed she has a very sensitive scalp and this brush is amazing no more fighting herto brush her hair and she doesn&#x27;t even complain about tangles anymore this brush is worth the money!!! I definitely recommend it to everyone!!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work....but it does!  My daughter has fine hair.  When she wakes in the morning her hair is all tangled.  In the past she&#x27;d cry when I tried to get the tangles out.  Not so now.  So glad I bought this!</li>
            <li> My 5 yr old has the most beautiful THICK LONG CURLY hair. Strangers love to touch her hair all the time. It was down to her wait at age 3. She refuses to let my cut it and I don&#x27;t think it would be any better cut short. So it is a PAIN to brush her hair every day. It&#x27;s a daunting task with oils, conditioners, 3 different brushes. So I thought I would try what what was claimed to be a detangling brush.&lt;br /&gt;This thing is a cheap pieces of junk. It does not work. I supposed it works if you spend 1/2 and hours brushing very small areas at at ime over and over working from the bottom up. It&#x27;s worse then the normal brushes I have. It also can scratch the scalp easily if you are not careful. The brush is too large for a child to hold as well. It does not work for thick curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;I suppose it works for thin straight hair that tangles a bit. But MOSt detanglers work for that type of hair.&lt;br /&gt;I will be trying another type of detangling brush. My daughter wants to try to the one currently being shown on TV in commercials but I noticed that they ratted the models hair up..... The model who has straight, shiny conditioned or oiled THIN STRAIGHT hair that the brush is slipping right through.so it&#x27;s not likely to work.... BUT hope springs eternal.&lt;br /&gt;NOT recommended for thick or curly hair.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A MUST purchase, MUST MUST MUST, your daughter will love brusing her own hair and you will love no more tears</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 4 year old daughter.  She has long curly hair.  It&#x27;s an everyday battle to brush her hair.  I saw this and bought it thinking this brush was a godsend to our problems.  This brush SUCKED!!!  It doesn&#x27;t work at all. It was constantly being pulled out of my hand and hitting the floor.  The bristles are hard &amp; stiff.  It was worse than using a regular brush.  Definately didn&#x27;t hold up to it&#x27;s claims.  BIG waste of money.  Not worth the $10 I payed for it.</li>
            <li> This is the only brush that works on my daughter&#x27;s super fine tangled hair. Huge bonus that it&#x27;s pink because that is her favorite color.</li>
            <li> First of all we ordered this one thinking it was the smaller version. We have misplaced our other one we got from Amazon... it will turn back up sometime,  but until then I had to get another one because going back to a regular brush for my girls long wavy hair wasn&#x27;t working out so well... they scream! But with the Knot Genie brush it isn&#x27;t so bad. It&#x27;s not exactly magic by any stretch of the imagination... I still have to work carefully and I have my own system with how I must get through their hair. But all in all the brush really helps. However the reason I bought this particular \\&quot;0.13  ounce Fairy Pink\\&quot; Knot Genie brush was because I thought it was the teeny genie, so that my girls could eventually brush their own hair and the brush would fit better into their smaller hands... but I received the regular size... oh well, now I&#x27;ve got an extra one for me to use until the original one shows up again.  Terrific brush!</li>
            <li> My two year old doesn&#x27;t have hair that gets extremely tangled, but she hates having it brushed.  Previously, we could only brush it without a tantrum about twice a week.  With the knot genie, we are able to brush her hair almost daily (sometimes even twice a day!).</li>
            <li> Super Cheaply made or price paid, but works ok so far. Probably wont last long. I&#x27;d think it was more of a $4 item</li>
            <li> I use this on my daughter&#x27;s hair straight out of the bath, and it glides through her hair very easily, from scalp to ends. very smooth brushing, no tugging, and I will be using it on her hair and my own while travelling overseas.</li>
            <li> This brush will make you WANT to brush your child&#x27;s hair .... promise! Yeah right, you&#x27;re probable thinking - you don&#x27;t know MY kid&#x27;s hair. But believe me, you&#x27;ll be amazed. My 4yo daughter refuses to cut her almost waist-length hair (have you ever tried to reason with a 4yo girl about hair?) I&#x27;m pretty sure that without this product she would one day have ended up in therapy talking about how her mom was the WORST hair brusher ever. She used to literally say &#x27;owwww&#x27; before a brush touched her hair - the brush was midair and she&#x27;d already be complaining. And now? No more complaints! It is a bit on the slippery side though, as some other reviewers have mentioned. For parents of very young kids: the bristles on the brush are reasonably sharp so I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d let a very young child use this without supervision but if you&#x27;re the one doing the brushing - this brush is a life (and time and sanity) saver!</li>
            <li> I bought this brush some time ago in the hopes that it would brush through my 5 year old daughter&#x27;s hair smoothly.  She has wavy, medium length hair.  When her hair is wet and freshly conditioned it works okay -- but any brush works okay then.  When her hair is dry is is awful!  It&#x27;s awkward to hold and really only gets to the top layer of hair.  I guess if you had half and hour to comb out the hair in sections it would work (as any brush would).  This product was not worth the money spent and it&#x27;s going into the garbage.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because my five year old daughter would literally run off when I tried to brush or comb her hair. Every time was a true battle due to her thick and usually tangled hair. We tried numerous shampoos and conditioners, plus multiple detangler sprays. None helped. This brush solved our problems. It literally glides right through her hair with complete ease. She won&#x27;t use another brush. I will admit, it took some getting used to initially because the bristles are more &amp;#34;sharp and pointy&amp;#34; feeling than regular brushes. This initially bothered her sensitive scalp some, but after a few days she was thanking me for buying his brush. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Both my hair and my daughter&#x27;s hair tangle easily. This seems to keep my hair less tangled compared to a regular hair brush. My daughter doesn&#x27;t complain as much when I brush out the tangles with it either.</li>
            <li> My daughter (10 months) has very curly hair that gets very matted after sleeping on it and washing it. I used to have to squirt tons of leave in baby conditioner and then pull and pull to get tangles out. Now I just brush through with this amazing brush- without any conditioner!! I cannot believe how awesome this works. It is a must have that I wish I would have discovered much sooner!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is any better than any other brush. My daughter still cries when I brush her hair with this. She doesn&#x27;t cry as hard with this brush, but didn&#x27;t solve my problem of her hurting when we brush her hair.</li>
            <li> This brush feels cheap, didn&#x27;t do a great job on tangles and made my daughter&#x27;s hair frizzy. I returned it shortly after.</li>
            <li> Great brush! Isn&#x27;t perfect as far as no knots but a lot better than a standard brush and works well on my 5 year old&#x27;s long wavy hair.</li>
            <li> this brush works great. my four year old doesn&#x27;t cry in pain when brushing her hair! I love it. buy it</li>
            <li> My daughter has an extremely tender head.  Also, she has super fine wavy hair.  If she sleeps on flannel pillowcases, her hair will knot up like felted wool.  I used to use a standard hair brush on her hair, it took forever and every time I brushed you could hear hair snapping and she would run, scream, cry, etc.  I couldn&#x27;t believe when I used this brush.  I used it in the morning, and with 5 quick strokes her entire head was tangle free and so smooth.  I have no idea what makes this brush work so much better, but it is a life saver.  It is truly amazing.  Definitely worth the $10 or so.</li>
            <li> My 5-year-old daughter HATES having knots brushed out of her hair. The kids haircut place at the mall sold me one of these and we were both amazed how well it works. So well in fact, that her first one disappeared to someone else&#x27;s home. So I bought a few more on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but willing to try anything as brushing my 5 year old daughter&#x27;s hair had turned into a 15 minute process of detangling spray and section by section brushing with a soft bristle brush.  The know genie works without detangling spray, takes 3-4 minutes to do her whole head, and makes her hair much smoother.  It is not perfect, but it by far the best item on the market for brushing children&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my daughter&#x27;s tangles. She has thin, fine hair that gets tangled easily.</li>
            <li> This brush really does work! My 4 year old HATED to have her (very fine) hair combed. After waking up the back of her head always looked like the proverbial rat&#x27;s nest. No amount of detangler ever seemed to work without a fight and lots of screaming. She was so excited when this came in the mail. She loves brushing her own hair now which takes a lot of stress out of the morning. My 10 year old also like to use it on her hair (much thicker but still easily tangled during sleep), when she can pry it away from her sister. The unexpected side benefit is that the brush does such a good job that my kids&#x27; blonde hair looks even blonder.</li>
            <li> This is indeed a revolutionary product for detangling hair!  I recommend to everyone !&lt;br /&gt;Ordering a few more to have on hand.</li>
            <li> This brush has been a life saver for my great granddaughter. She has natural curly hair &amp; hated to have her hair brushed. She is only three &amp; she screamed &amp; cried every time we tried to brush or comb her hair. Since we got this brush she co-operates so much better. We love this brush.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and honestly did not expect great things. My daughter has very think curly hair and brushing is a struggle. Wow....was I wrong about this brush. Once I found how it works best for us, separating and brushing in sections, it is so easy. Detangling is no longer a struggle! It&#x27;s quick and easy, plus her hair looks great. I&#x27;m so happy we found this brush!</li>
            <li> My 6 year old daughter has baby fine hair that knots easily.  This is the best tool for getting those knots out!</li>
            <li> My daughter always complained of pain when brushing her hair. This doesn&#x27;t completly emlinate it but defintely has decreased the number of ow&#x27;s. Worth it!</li>
            <li> This was a gift from my very sweet husband. I have very long hair, and this makes brushing it a breeze - no more ripping my hair out, it&#x27;s super quick and doesn&#x27;t hurt one bit. It leaves your hair soft, shiny and no hair in the brush afterward.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible. To get the knots out it ripped out my 4 year olds hair and shredded the ends. I would never recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> Use this brush for our 8 and 4 year old girls.  They both have long hair and after taking a bath, sometimes it is hard to brush - this brush works great on their wet hair.  I have purchased this as a baby gift for 2 of my friends when they had girls.</li>
            <li> I had been fighting with my girls about their hair for years. Always a struggle, until I found this brush. I  use with a bit of detangler spray and it&#x27;s awesome! No more battles and no more tears!!!!</li>
            <li> WOW, this brush is amazing! It isn&#x27;t made with magic or pixie dust, but it&#x27;s simple design is perfect for my hair as well as my daughter&#x27;s hair.  My 5 year old have almost waist-length, thick, relatively straight with a little bit of curl on the ends-kind of hair.  Before Knot Genie, brushing her hair was torture for both of us.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it when I brushed her hair for the first time with Knot Genie, and she didn&#x27;t complain AT ALL.  I plan on buying another one to keep in my travel bag so I always can count on having one with me!</li>
            <li> This brush has made brushing my 3 yr olds hair a much more pleasant experience.  It cuts brushing time in half and in the month we&#x27;ve been using it, she hasn&#x27;t cried once!</li>
            <li> My daughter has very long hair and I was hoping this brush would make getting tangles out much easier.  Well not for her hair.  She has long fine straight hair but this brush did not make it very easy and I keep loosing my grip and dropping the brush.  Frustrating.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to the produce at the hair salon when I took my daughter in for a trim.  They had it available for purchase but I was able to get it cheaper on Amazon.  I purchased two (one for a back up) because I&#x27;m not sure of the product life.  My son even likes to use it because it&#x27;s so soft!  Which is great since it was always a fight to brush his hair because he would say the brush/comb hurt.</li>
            <li> This brush is pretty amazing. My daughter has thin long hair, but lots of it. It tangles very easily, and I am pretty sure she somehow does gymnastics in bed, and she wakes up with nasty hair. This brush is a life saver. She doesn&#x27;t cry anymore or anything, but the only complaint is it can pull some hair out. I would recommend it though in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> This worked great on my 3 year old granddaughter&#x27;s curly, long hair.  No protests of cries of &amp;#34;be gentle&amp;#34; with this brush!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This thing really works.&lt;br /&gt;No hair being pulled on my daughter&#x27;s head.&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;Yes I will buy another one.</li>
            <li> my cousin bought one and i got to try it out and loved it so i bought myself one im happy</li>
            <li> Worked great on bi-racial hair.  Did not pull like a pick or comb. Worked well on wet hair. Daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> My young daughter has had to have her hair cut short as it gets tangled very easily. Even then, it still gets snarls. This worked like a charm to get through them without the pulling and extra long time efforts it took to brush her hair.</li>
            <li> my daughter has superfine slightly curly hair. she sleeps burrito-wrapped in a blanket, with it over her head, so when she wakes up her hair is like a giant tangled cloud. Giant mess, lots of tears while combing. After some review, I picked one of these out (I let her pick the pink one) and there has been way less crying when we comb out the hair. We still use detangler (I&#x27;ve got some Avon stuff she likes) to give us an edge, but this works much better than the comb or brush we were using before. You just have to be patient and keep gently brushing the hair, eventually the knots all work out.</li>
            <li> It does take out tangles, however, the bristles are hard and long and even on my adult scalp they hurt. I am sure it is intentional, to help with thick or long hair, but just be aware of this if you have a sensitive child! It is also rather large, it felt uncomfortable in my normal adult hand, I would recommend the teeny version for children.</li>
            <li> This is almost exactly like the brush the hospital sent home with us when my daughter was born (except not as soft).  It&#x27;s great at brushing her long, tangled hair and doesn&#x27;t seem to hurt. She still doesn&#x27;t like it because it has hard bristles, but it&#x27;s a much better alternative to regular brushes or combs.</li>
            <li> my daughters hair gets tangled just looking at it wrong and she does not like to sit still while brushing her hair, so I finally broke down and purchased a more expensive brush, honestly, it was worth the price! this brush is fabulous! I did not have to use detangler spray, it glided right through her hair and she loves brushing her own hair with it too! If you fight your daughter to brush her hair, buy this brush, you will not regret it!</li>
            <li> I gave the knot genies to two of my grandaughters who have long hair and trouble getting knots out without pain.  When they tried it, they both said it took the knots out better than a regular brush, but it still hurt when they used it.</li>
            <li> After reading quite a few of these reviews, I decided to try this brush for my daughter. Her hair is straight, about medium thickness and the length of her shoulder blades. I tried starting from the bottom like a regular brush, I tried starting from the top and brushing straight down like one reviewer recommended. I tried after conditioner and with detangler. I have yet found a way that this is anything special. The only plus I see is that the bristles are so flexible that they bend instead of breaking the hair once they hit the knots (thought the sound is pretty much the same, which I can&#x27;t stand). I usually can get all but the last 2-3 inches brushed out pretty well with it, but then have to use a regular brush to work out all the knots at the end. Using it from the end ups seems to work no better than a regular brush. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend unless you have shorter, fine hair to use it on.</li>
            <li> I used this on my little sisters who all have different hair types and thickness. It was alright, but didn&#x27;t make a huge difference. I feel a regular detangling brush from Target worked better. Maybe I was expecting too much from it, but I doubt I&#x27;d recommend it to friends or family from my experience.</li>
            <li> When I was a little girl, I would hate having my hair combed when I got out of the bath.  I have always had very fine hair, which tangles easily.  It would give me headaches trying to get my hair combed, even with lots of Sesame Street detangler.  Even though my hair is fine, I have a lot of it.  It gets tangled easily because I wear it up so much.  When it falls down, I don&#x27;t think to brush it before putting it back up, which leads to a lot of tangles.  I still get headaches trying to get the knots out.  This brush has helped a lot.  It detangles the nest of hair a lot easier than struggling with a regular brush.  Ever had a hair nest so bad you got your brush stuck in it?  Oh yeah.  Been there.  Since I have fine hair, it does tend to get staticky more easily, but then again it&#x27;s also winter which doesn&#x27;t help.  I don&#x27;t blame the brush.  Any brush would make it staticky.  If you&#x27;ve got a little girl with fine hair, I suggest you at least try this brush.  No matter how adorable Sesame Street detangler might be, nobody wants their hair doused with so much detangler that it looks like she didn&#x27;t even wash her hair!</li>
            <li> UPDATED Review:&lt;br /&gt;When i received this brush in the mail, I tried using it like a regular brush, expecting it to pull through the tangles right away.  I tried it a couple times, and then chucked it in a drawer when it didn&#x27;t seem to product any results.  About 6 months later, my husband saw me struggling to brush our little girl&#x27;s wet, curly hair and asked why i wasn&#x27;t using the knot genie? He pulled it out and showed me that if you continuously, yet softly, keep brushing down the hair, the knots eventually work themselves to the bottom and out.  It makes an odd noise, as if the bristles are just brushing past the hair, but somehow miraculously it works.  It DOES take a little longer than it would to brush with a regular brush, but since the crying fits are non-existent anymore the entire start-to-finish event is probably still the same amount of time. This brush should come with instructions - maybe it did and i tossed them out figuring i didn&#x27;t need hairbrush instructions? it&#x27;s been a while since i ordered it.  Anyway, give this brush a try, and just be patient until you get the technique down.  I feel so guilty that I gave a bad review without understanding the concept of the brush! And also, Kudos to husband for figuring it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Orginial Review:&lt;br /&gt;I almost feel like the other reviews were written by people who sell the product.  Unfortunately, this brush did little to nothing to ease post-bath brushings of my toddler&#x27;s curly mop.  She was excited about the color, size, and name of this brush when it arrived in the mail- especially after I assured her it would make the brushing experience much more tolerable.  It doesn&#x27;t pull through very well, and it just doesn&#x27;t seem to be any better than any other inexpensive brush I&#x27;ve tried on her in the past - and I feel like I have tried them all.  This will go in the drawer of unsuccessful purchases, along with the other 4 brushes, and I will continue my search!  I gave it 2 stars rather than 1 because it is cute, therefore somewhat more appealing to a toddler than a regular brush.is cute, therefore somewhat more appealing to a toddler than a regular brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, I was a little skeptical, even after reading the positive reviews here. But now? Wow! This brush is amazing!! My 4 y/o daughter has very long hair which tangles easily, and has always disliked having her hair brushed. It would normally take me 4-5 minutes to brush it to where it was tangle-free. My 6 y/o son has longer-than-average hair and would wince and complain any time a hairbrush even came near him. I just used this on both of them for the first time and had their hair tangle-free within 30 seconds and without a single complaint or whimper! I can&#x27;t recommend this product enough!! Finally, an end to the hair-brushing battle, and I know I&#x27;m not hurting them to get it done.</li>
            <li> My daughter has shoulder length fine hair that tangles easily. Brushing has always been a tear-filled, screaming experience, but this brush has been a lifesaver! She will even brush her own hair, and my husband noted it&#x27;s miraculous ability to brush virtually painlessly. Thank you to whoever made this!</li>
            <li> Every morning I spent 10-15 minutes trying to detangle my 7 year old&#x27;s shoulder length straight hair ,which gets all matted and knotted after sleep.The knot genie has made it possible to reduce that time to 1-2 minutes! and voila we are done.No more screaming and pulling and tugging,no more threatens to cut hair length,and best of all,she can sometimes do it herself.&lt;br /&gt;I was so impressed I bought one for my own hip length hair too.Saves me a ton of time and frustration.&lt;br /&gt;Here are a few tips from us to tame the hardest tangles:&lt;br /&gt;1.Shampoo any chlorine out esp. after swimming.&lt;br /&gt;2.Use a good conditioner after rinsing shampoo.Rinse well.&lt;br /&gt;3.If hair is exceptionally frizzy,I use some  coconut oil to smooth hair out and unknot the tangles before showering,then shampoo it away.&lt;br /&gt;4.Its better to work(using this brush to detangle) on dry hair than wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;5.Work your way from bottom up,starting with a few inches off the bottom of hair rather than the top.&lt;br /&gt;6.For sensitive scalp,hold the hair in your hand away from skin as much as possible.&lt;br /&gt;7.For a finishing touch,can use a wide tooth comb after brushing with knot genie.I don&#x27;t have to though bcoz we get all untangled and silky smooth by then.&lt;br /&gt;8.For exceptionally tough and matted knots,I hold it in my hands,and keep brushing it from various angles and it unknots really fast.&lt;br /&gt;9.Always hold your child&#x27;s hair just above the knot,while you brush on it,so she doesn&#x27;t feel the tugging on her scalp causing pain and tears.&lt;br /&gt;10.For longer hair,I suggest loosely braiding hair and securing with a hairband after drying well,before going to sleep to eliminate matting in the morning.Or make a ponytail at the end and pull it above the pillow so not to sleep on it.&lt;br /&gt;11.For short hair,at least pull the hair to the top,and away above the pillow so you avoid sleeping on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;12.Brushing once in the morning and once before going to bed helps to tame tangles.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this knot genie,saves me a lot of time on busy mornings.Very easy to use,I only wish they had a kettle bell type handle or a long handle on it for easy holding.It is a wide brush.&lt;br /&gt;NO more harmful chemical detangler sprays ,which never worked by the way.Thankyou for this great invention..&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this knot genie,saves me a lot of time on busy mornings.Very easy to use,I only wish they had a kettle bell type handle or a long handle on it for easy holding.It is a wide brush.&lt;br /&gt;NO more harmful chemical detangler sprays ,which never worked by the way.Thankyou for this great invention.</li>
            <li> While the name of this item clearly states: \\&quot;Knot Genie Detangling Brush\\&quot; it is in fact a \\&quot;Teeny Genie Detangling Brush\\&quot; a much smaller version of the original, which can be purchased for whole $4 less. Quite misleading.</li>
            <li> I love this brush! I bought it for my 3 year old whose hair tangles super easily. She loves this brush, barely complains any more about having her hair brushed. I  now use it on myself as well. i can feel it catch in the tangle, but it works it&#x27;s way right through.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve purchased three Knot Genies so far - one for home, one for the car and one for my daughter&#x27;s school bag. It works SO well and minimizes the number of tears on my tender-headed kiddo. She has thick, wavy hair and is prone to tangles. It doesn&#x27;t banish all knots (only a true genie could do that) but it does get rid of a good 90% of them. The size is good too. My daughter can easily fit it in her hand, and it&#x27;s not too small to get lost in mine or my husband&#x27;s hand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s odd shaped so it doesn&#x27;t fit &amp;#34;nicely&amp;#34; in your hand &amp; pretty hard bristles. It does comb my toddlers hair well but it isn&#x27;t my go to brush.</li>
            <li> my daughter loves this, works great!</li>
            <li> My daughter use to fight me all the time when brushing her hair. now she holds still and she will even brush her own hair now! she loves this brush!</li>
            <li> My 3 year old had long hair and we got this to help get the knots out without too much tugging.  It still tugs a little bit and we still hear the &amp;#34;ow&amp;#34;s.</li>
            <li> The knot genie works great. My little girl cried every time you would brush her hair, but with the knot genie there&#x27;s no more knots and no more crying.</li>
            <li> The comb takes a really long time to comb through the tangles. I. Would not buy another knot genie brush.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair gets very tangled, and was a struggle every morning to brush it out.  This brush makes it much better.</li>
            <li> I am a hairstylist who specializes in children&#x27;s haircuts. I am a freelance hairstylist who works with children who have behavioral, psychological, and physical disabilities.  I&#x27;m also a mom of two girls with extra sensitive scalps. The people that give this brush a negative review are only looking for reasons to complain. This is the miracle brush that every parent should own. I&#x27;ve used this brush and others like it (Knot Genie &amp; Tangle Teaser) for years and could not do without it. If your child runs screaming every time you take a brush out, this is exactly what you need. It gently eases tangles out tear free, and can be a valuable training tool to teaching your child to brush his/her own hair. I like to call it my “no owie” brush. If your child has thick hair, work in small sections by separating the hair and use a good detangling spray or leave in conditioner if the hair is extra tangled. I have seen these brushes help to remove mats of tangled hair that I thought did not have a chance at coming untangled. Ive also used it on my own hair in the shower as a shampoo brush and it gives a great scalp massage. It is also great for making ponytails as the brush has a slight curve for a wider base to gather hair and get it smooth. When it first arrives, have patience with it and your child. There will be slight adjustment period especially for children who have sensory issues, work in small sections taking extra care to not put any strain on the hair. One wrong tug and the brushing session is over. Do yourself and your child a favor, buy one of these brushes, I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Better than other brushes but no miracle brush. My girls still hate having their hair brushed and still cry when their are snarls.</li>
            <li> my granddaughter&#x27;s hairy is fine AND curly this worked great. mom and daughter don&#x27;t dread having to brush hair. The quick delivery and pricing were great.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old daughter hates having her hair brushed.  She literally runs away when the brush comes out.  I usually try and do it while she&#x27;s sitting at the table eating breakfast before school so she&#x27;s trapped!  She likes this brush, it&#x27;s pink and girly.  She claims it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much and will sometimes look back to make sure this is the brush I&#x27;m using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while this brush doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as a regular hair brush on first &amp;#34;swipe&amp;#34;, it also doesn&#x27;t really get out the knots as easily either.  The bristles just kind of go around them instead, basically ignoring them.  It feels to me like it takes a lot more work to actually get her hair snarl free, but maybe not, since she&#x27;ll usually lets me use this brush on her and will try and hide from the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, while it&#x27;s not perfect, my daughter generally will let me use the &amp;#34;special brush&amp;#34; on her and that alone is worth a lot! :)</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading the reviews. It definitely did not help make brushing my daughter&#x27;s hair ouch less. I think it actually hurt worse than the brush we were already using. Maybe I wasn&#x27;t using it right but it isn&#x27;t flexible and the bristles aren&#x27;t very soft. We just use it on her dolls now. I bought the Wet Brush after purchasing this one and it works so much better.</li>
            <li> Das ist zu hart, und bisher v&amp;ouml;llig anders verwendet! Sehr entt&amp;auml;uscht!</li>
            <li> It works, but not hurt free.  A bit on the chunky side, especially for little hands.</li>
            <li> Finally!  Girls will brush their hair!  Fine, spiderweb hair easily tangles, and breaks if pulled too hard.  Knot Genie gently detangles without pulling.  Kids willingly use it.  Thick hair requires brushing top and underside of hair as prickles are too short to go thru hair.</li>
            <li> I have 3 girls ranging in age from 5 to 11 yrs old and ALL three rave about this brush!! They&#x27;ve used it on dry and wet hair and we literally don&#x27;t have any more screaming or tears while brushing hair. Their hair is also different lengths and types but the knot genie is loved by all of them. I bought each of them their own. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> First, the quality of this brush just seems really, really, cheap.  It&#x27;s still holding up for us, but then we rarely use this brush.  We only reach for it if we misplaced any of our other brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually hate using this brush on my daughter&#x27;s hair.  I don&#x27;t like the sound it makes as I&#x27;m brushing her hair with it.  It sounds like it&#x27;s pulling her hair every time I brush it.  It doesn&#x27;t really remove knots any better than a regular comb would do for us.  I&#x27;m sure hair type might be a factor here.  My daughter has thin, straight hair.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anybody.  We will just stick to using a good detangler and brush/comb.</li>
            <li> We love it as no other brush, comb or other even came close. But it still cannot overcome all of the goobers she manages to smear into her hair. They come out eventually, but with a lot of distraction and gentle work.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. This brush really does get the tangles out without pulling hair.  We will definitely purchase another brush.</li>
            <li> We love this brush! Brushing my 2 year old daughter&#x27;s hair every morning used to be a scream fest, but since we started using Knot Genie there has been no more screaming and crying. Fits in my hand nicely, as well as hers.</li>
            <li> This brush is not a miracle worker, but it is the best brush we have come across.  Our little girl has thick, long hair and is always complaining when we brush it, but this brush does seem to go through her hair much more easily that the others.  Happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> My 2 1/2 year old daughter has long, very fine hair which is always tangled. She would be tortured every time I  try to comb through her hair, especially after washing it. Wet or dry, the Genie brush glides through effortlessy as though there are no tangles at all. No more tears and running away from me. She also LOVES brushing her own hair now. Can&#x27;t say enough about it. Worth every penny and truly a miracle brush!!!!!</li>
            <li> I got this brush for my daughter for Christmas and she likes it much better than traditional brushes!  It is easy to hold and does a great job moving through her hair.  The only issue is that when it&#x27;s a bad knot, especially on the underside by her neck, she still yells!  It doesn&#x27;t move through the large knots as well, but for general brushing it works well!  I would recommend it for kids who want the long hair and hate having their parents brush it!  I only intervene when I can see the knot after she brushes.</li>
            <li> My daughter (almost 3) has super thin, long hair that tangles at the drop of a hat. She freaked out every time I brushed her hair... until we got this brush. A friend recommended it, and I didn&#x27;t have high hopes, but it works miracles. Call it part placebo effect - she has a &amp;#34;special pink brush&amp;#34; now, but it definitely detangles more gently and effectively than other brushes. You still have to be gentle, and work through the knots, but it doesn&#x27;t yank and hurt the scalp. $10 for a brush seems steep, but I&#x27;d pay $100 if it works.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old daughter hates getting her long hair brushed after baths. I bought this after the kids hair salon we went to used it and even the hairstylist said it was a miracle brush. Sure enough we bought out own and she brushes her hair or lets me do it everynight without complaining. I think it actually sounds rougher than it is on the head.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t even just for kids. Anyone who has long, tangle-prone hair needs this.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter&#x27;s morning hair routine is improved 1000-fold.</li>
            <li> you can get a nice wooden one for the same price at a local beauty supply store. save your money.</li>
            <li> I was suspect of all the rave reviews - but I must say, it is amazing. In general, it slides through her &amp;#34;rat&#x27;s nest&amp;#34; with ease. Even with the few remaining tangles in the back of her head, it seems to move through them without hurting her. This size is also perfect -- says its made for kid hands, but this fits my adult hand nicely  - I&#x27;m glad I did not buy te bigger one.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this brush when a hairdresser recommended it, but after daily struggles brushing my 5-year old daughter&#x27;s hair I finally took a chance and bought this through Amazon.  It was pretty much life-changing.  My daughter complained exponentially less about morning hair brushing and even started brushing her hair herself!  She still uses it daily and she&#x27;s 8 now- she&#x27;s always recommending it to young cousins and friends.  Totally worth the money and a must-have for any household with little girls.</li>
            <li> Works like magic on my girl&#x27;s fine hair.  No screaming fits!  Unfortunately plastic bristles start to bend after a couple of months and the brush needs to be replaced.</li>
            <li> I saw this product, for the first time, in Parents Magazine. It&#x27;s assessment, and those of many reviewers were not wrong - this is an amazing product!!  My three year old has very long, fine hair and it tangles constantly. This product has made post bath time and morning time brushing out of tangles a breeze.  And, the best part, it causes no pain. My daughter lets me use it whenever I need to and for as long as I need to!!! Highly reccomend it!!!</li>
            <li> My darling daughter has curly, crazy, red hair. After begging me to let her grow it out, I was in a &amp;#34;hair fight&amp;#34; induced rage when I stumbled across this on amazon. I ordered it as a last resort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A month later, she HAPPILY brushes her hair, (which in itself, is a miracle.) She keeps the brush in her room and brushes when she wakes up and before bed. It&#x27;s a FANTASTIC investment for ANY child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- It truly works. Your fights will stop. Fairy Pink? There may be fairies inside that make this work. It&#x27;s that good.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It fits my daugher&#x27;s adorable and smallish little hand. It&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t slip out of her hand easily. Must be the fairies.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s cheap, but not cheaply-made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- This would have prevented the trauma from my childhood. They need to put this on the next time machine. If this review is still up, you know that didn&#x27;t work. -Just sayin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I&#x27;m pretty sure there are no fairies inside the brush, but it&#x27;s still awesome.</li>
            <li> Wow! I have long, wavy, super thick hair that is pretty much a recipe for disaster when it comes to tangles. Ever since I was a little girl the underside of my hair basically turns to dreadlocks if I do not get the knots out. Up until now combing or brushing my hair has been a 20-30 minute ordeal of pain that would still leave tangles. My hair would tangle so badly that it would just break off at the knot leaving me with a handful of hair to throw away after a brushing. Fast-forward to today, I open the Knot Genie, start at my scalp, and the brush easily glides all the way to the end of my hair with nary a snag!!! Amazing! My hair feels and looks so much softer now.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughters&#x27; hair, because combing their hair after bath is no fun for anyone. My older daughter has shoulder length wavy fine hair and my younger daughter has fine but thick and straight shoulder length hair. I bought this in combination with Organic Sprout Miracle Detangler which I also highly recommend. What I love about this detangling brush is that it makes getting the tangles out a much faster process. There is still some annoyance with tangles, but a couple of swipes through the hair and they are gone - much quicker than the comb or brush. I am ordering one of these for myself (I have very thick fine hair that is four inches past my shoulder) as I have borrowed my daughters&#x27; and find it way more effective than the wide tooth comb I normally use.</li>
            <li> This brush does seem to work as advertised. My two-year old girls let me brush their hair with it, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to pull.</li>
            <li> This thing is wonderful.  Her hair is very thick and tangles very easily.  This helps get through all of that without tears.</li>
            <li> My kid gets the worst knots in her hair and it would take about a half hour at least to get them out. Now it takes less then 10 minutes it the most amazing brush ever and i would recommend it to anyone with little girls.</li>
            <li> My daughter has hair down the middle of her back. Every day is a battle that typically ends with crying due to trying to get out the snarles. This product did not work AT ALL for us. Not even a little bit. Does not work as advertised.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this for my 5-1/2 yr old girl after having read the reviews. She has soft, medium-thick, and wavy hair down to the middle of her back.  Of course it gets knotty all the time and brushing is a struggle.  She first tried it right after school yesterday. Well, I should say her 7-yr old brother tried it on her yesterday and she nearly screamed her lungs out. Okay, I thought - it requires the loving touch of mom to do well :). So this morning we tried it. Last night we washed and conditioned her hair but I forgot to comb it before bed.  You might discount this review because of that but it&#x27;s not the first time this has happened so I know what a fair comparison is to a regular brush.  Anyway, it was still just a disaster. It just got stuck in her hair like a regular brush would, except the volume of bristles on the brush made it worse. And the SOUND of trying to get through the knots was so troubling I bet to her it made it seem worse than it was. It was like the sound of brushing my dog&#x27;s (a goldendoodle) hair.  Also I realize how desperate I must&#x27;ve been becuase the thing is not worth more than a McDonalds Happy Meal toy. It&#x27;s a hollow plastic shell with short plastic bristles. I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking paying that mush for a brush. You know what they say:  if it sounds too good to be true... My next step:  get layers in her hair to reduce the amount that can get knots.</li>
            <li> My daughter has curly hair and would scream every time I brushed her hair. Well I bought this and it works much better than any regular brush I&#x27;ve tried. She still cries, but she no longer screams, and I think part of that is just she&#x27;s 5 and doesn&#x27;t want her hair brushed. But ever she says she likes this brush much better than any other. It&#x27;s not a miracle brush, but it&#x27;s pretty great and works for us.</li>
            <li> just a gimmic. pulls my daughters curly hair and is even unpleasant in my STRAIGHT wet hair</li>
            <li> So I bought this for my 3 yo curly head daughter who absolutely hates to get her hair brushed. I read the reviews and thought I need to give it a try, since most comments were positive.. trying this on dry hair totally failed.. She was crying and screaming.. on wet hair, it did a better job, but only if I added detangler spray to it and to be honest, a normal brush would have done the same job then.. I then used it on myself, and I am by all means NOT tenderheaded.. WOW.. it freakin HURT! The bristles are way too sharp feeling and for a tender toddler head definitely not ok! So.. not it is laying around the house and we are using it on our cat, who seems to like it much better!</li>
            <li> This is a great tool for brushing my daughter&#x27;s hair. Getting those tangles out was traumatic for her and me! This does the trick painlessly and quickly. It is good for fine hair too. Exactly what I was hoping for. 5 stars!</li>
            <li> While I had high hopes for this brush, it just does not do the trick on my daughter&#x27;s superfine blonde hair.  Her tangles get to be pretty matted down, but this brush worked absolutely no miracles for us.  Our hairdresser encouraged us to use a wide-toothed comb and a thick conditioner in the tub to carefully comb out the tangles.  This method, plus a regular brush, starting from the bottom up and carefully detangling the tangles, works just as well as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that I gave it to my daughter for Christmas from Santa, and that the hype of that alone got her attention because I told her it was probably magic.  Kinda disappointing, for both of us, really.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves her Knot Genie! She no longer complains about getting her hair brushed &amp; loves to brush our hair with it!</li>
            <li> This brush has stopped the screaming matches between my daughter and I when it comes time to brush her hair.  It was either this works or she was getting a hair cut!</li>
            <li> I have been fighting my 5-year-old for years to get her to let me brush her hair.  We have tried many brushes and detanglers.  This one is NOT pain-free but it is VERY pain-minimal and she has the most tangle-prone hair of any kid I&#x27;ve ever met.  This brush does the work of detanging without making you feel like your hair is being ripped out of your head.  My daughter likes to brush her own hair now and she absolutely loves using this brush.</li>
            <li> This brush actually allows me to brush my toddler&#x27;s hair with out any tears! From either of us.  I cannot recommend this brush highly enough.  Buy it!</li>
            <li> My daughter is very tender headed and has always fought me brushing her hair.  Now she brushes it herself and no pain!  Great product.</li>
            <li> the price is good, even it is for kids, we can use it too. good for hair. color is pretty</li>
            <li> Great brush for fussy little girl with long hair! Only one she&#x27;ll permit.</li>
            <li> Was really looking forward  to something that could handle my daughter&#x27;s waist length hair. She doesn&#x27;t have  thick hair per se, but she has a lot of it. This brush was no match for her hair. Back to screaming during brushing until we find something else.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and was excited to try this brush. My daughter hates having her hair brushed, and I was hoping this would solve the problem. It has made it a little easier, but she still complains it hurts sometimes. It&#x27;s an ok brush, but doesn&#x27;t detangle as pain free as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> No more tears at bath time any more!!  My daughter has really long, fine hair &amp; a lot of it!  It&#x27;s always a knotted up mess &amp; takes a while to comb out.  With our new brush we get through it in 1/2 the time with no tears.</li>
            <li> We were looking for something to brush my daughters long hair and this isn&#x27;t any better than the brushes we already had. Not only does it still hurt her but it doesn&#x27;t brush all the way through the hair.  It doesn&#x27;t get the snarls underneath her hair.  Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Works great! I brush my children&#x27;s hair with this first to get most of the knots out then the regular brush to finish up.</li>
            <li> My 3-year-old daughter&#x27;s fine hair would get so many tangles in it, and I&#x27;d make a funny story about the rat&#x27;s having a party in her hair while she slept to keep her distracted while I worked and worked to get the snarls out.  With this, there&#x27;s no time to even start the story, it gets the job done so quickly.  I&#x27;m very impressed with how well it&#x27;s been working.</li>
            <li> I have never written a review for a product before, but I feel this one definitely deserves one. I deal with my daughter&#x27;s screaming every morning when I brush her hair. This product does NOT work. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I have 5 girls with long hair, and hoped this would help us at least a little. But it is nothing but an un-glorified hairbrush. The ends of the bristles are quite sharp...which may or may not help get tangles out, but several of my kids don&#x27;t like the feeling of it. Also, it is WAAAAAY to big for any child (and still hard for even me) to hold in my hand, it doesn&#x27;t have a handle. And then, when they or I drop it - because is it slippery, and too large to hold well, it comes apart and needs to be popped back together. What a waste of $$$.</li>
            <li> Daughter loves this hairbrush! It really works! No more tears</li>
            <li> This product works for detangling painlessly. For that reason I will continue to use for my daughter. No more crying or running and hiding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the bristles are pointy plastic. They scratch the scalp if you brush too close to the scalp. I wish I had shopped around more.</li>
            <li> My daughter has tight curly hair that can become severely matted.  As a dad trying to help her get ready in the morning I can say this brush works as advertised to tame the mane. We typically use it with a spray bottle of water to keep the frizz down. I&#x27;d give it five stars but no brush works perfectly for this type of hair. This brush plus water is definitely the best combination we&#x27;ve found. She let&#x27;s me brush her hair again :)</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing!  My 3-year old has very fine, long hair.  Every morning and every night it was a struggle to brush due to tangles.  She would scream and/or run away the minute she saw me with a brush.  Not anymore with this new brush.  I can now easily brush her hair and it does not hurt her at all.  I am surprised by all the negative reviews, so it could be that it&#x27;s not great for all hair types.  My daughter&#x27;s hair is long and very fine, with layers.  I brush from the very top down, holding the bristles against her head and back.  The bristles are pretty sharp, so you just have to be sure not to press too hard when you brush.  I liked it so much, I bought a second one - one for upstairs, one for downstairs.  No more fighting/screaming!</li>
            <li> My 4 year old daughter has very fine, curly hair.  Virtually the only time I can get a comb or brush through it is right after washing and conditioning it.  By the next morning it is a tangled mess.  She used to CRY every time I tried to brush or comb it because it hurt so much.  I bought one of these not expecting much, but it is amazing.  No matter how tangled her hair is, the Knot Genie goes right through without pulling and now her hair looks great all of the time.  I&#x27;m getting several more so that we can have them with us all the time.  GREAT product!</li>
            <li> I waited a bit to write this review. Wanted to try it for a few weeks just to be sure, and know what? Fan-frickin-tastic. If you&#x27;re a dad combing your kid&#x27;s hair, do yourself and them a favor. Pick one up ASAP.</li>
            <li> Product works well on my daughter&#x27;s hair!  I have one daughter with curly hair and one with thick hair and it works well on both.</li>
            <li> It works good to get out tangles quickly but it really needs a handle. I drop it way too often and end up switching back to my daughter&#x27;s regular brush/comb but its not a bad product just could use improvement.</li>
            <li> Tried different brushes and each one my daughter would scream and cry.  She doesn&#x27;t really have hard hair to brush but she just did not like it.  With this, I hear nothing but &amp;#34;can I brush my hair&amp;#34;.  It is great.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my toddler who hates getting her hair brushed. This is the only brush that she will use, either by myself or she does, that doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;hurt&amp;#34; her. So I&#x27;m happy because less drama.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on my daughter&#x27;s curly hair. Hard to hold in your hand.</li>
            <li> Amazing ! I bought it as a birthday present and two days later I got a phone call from my friend telling me how well it works and it&#x27;s the first time she used a brush that didn&#x27;t pull out her fluffy hair lol</li>
            <li> Maybe it is age but our daughter is finally coming her extremely thick hair and this brush helps.  The no handle takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li> My stepdaughter used to run away, hide,  and cry after her bath!! She insists that it doesn&#x27;t hurt anymore with this brush!! Well worth the $$</li>
            <li> I am sure it works for some bit was not good for my daughters curly hair</li>
            <li> Not exactly a miracle for my 4 year old, but it has definitely helped.  She still hates getting her hair combed.  However, I find this brush works best if the hair is wet.  The bristles do feel very hard to the touch.  It is also a bit difficult to hold because of the shape.  I&#x27;m not sure a miracle brush actually exists for kids who hate getting their hair combed.  I still use it daily, but prefer to use it on wet hair.</li>
            <li> Works great on our little girls sensitive hair, no more tears to brush hair.</li>
            <li> Horrible,horrible brush!&lt;br /&gt;I have 3 children, 10 year old with thin hair and a very sensitive scalp, a 3 year old son with short hair and a 2 year old daughter with long thick hair. They all hate this brush. No matter what I do it doesn&#x27;t make it any easier to get knots out,can&#x27;t use it at all on dry hair. My oldest was so excited to get this brush and has tried to use it over and over but ends up in tears more when she uses it. We&#x27;ve tried every way the company has told us to use it and it&#x27;s just a painful brush. I&#x27;ve tried it on myself and I have to agree with my children.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very fine, long, straight hair.  Due to this, she gets tangles very easily.  I bought this because it was recommended to me.  When I used this the first time in her hair, the brush got stuck within the knot and I not only had to get the tangle out, but also get the brush out.  I tried this brush on several occasions with no avail.  I think this brush may work on a lot of types of hair, but fine and straight is not one of them.</li>
            <li> Daughter used to hate combing her hair and would cry every time we had to do it. The knot genie now makes this event in our house much more pleasant. Anyone with kids that have long hair should buy it!</li>
            <li> Native-American and African-American wavy-to-curly long long hair.  Very nice and painless detangling (and break-free), even on dry (though lightly moisterized) hair.</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness.  For the last couple of years I have struggled brushing my daughter&#x27;s hair every morning.  I even resorted to getting it cut into a bob this year because I couldn&#x27;t bear the temper tantrums.  I was about to get it cut again.  I had tried detangling spray and that didn&#x27;t work.  I was sceptical that this would work. But it does! And it is fantastic! This brush is seriously going to brighten every morning for both me and my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would mention is that I wish it had a handle.  I&#x27;m not a fan of holding this shape.  I&#x27;m not sure if they designed it this way because it needs to be that way to work, or if they are just trying to make it look different for the sake of it.  But really it is just a small negative, as I can&#x27;t live without it now!</li>
            <li> My 6 y.o. daughter has long, very fine hair that tangles very easy and brushing it is a constant battle.  I found this brush at a hair salon and bought 2 more online just so we could always find one.  Plus her older brothers kept stealing hers.  She brushes her own every day and there is never any more tears.  I would recommend this brush to anyone.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 2 daughters - 1 has very long, wavy hair, kinda thick. the other has short but spiral curly hair.  This hairbrush works fine, i guess? I don&#x27;t see what the fuss is about - I&#x27;ve not really seen any difference b/w this and regular brushes.  Maaaaaaybe it&#x27;s slightly better in terms of hair pulling, however, the bristles on this hairbrush are very short, so maybe it doesn&#x27;t pull as much b/c it&#x27;s not brushing through as much?  I don&#x27;t know.  I&#x27;m using this only b/c my girls love pink, and it&#x27;s something different for them.  However, they have not complained more or less with these (than they do with regular hair brushes). For the detangling, I went out and bought detangling spray and that seems to help a bit.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. My daughter absolutely loves it. She can finally brush though her own hair on her own. Serious time saver in the morning, not to mention no more screaming and crying from my daughter. Lol Thank You</li>
            <li> My eight-year-old daughter has been using the Knot Genie Detangling brush since early last year and absolutely loves it. Prior to discovering the Knot Genie, my daughter would burst into tears every time I brushed her hair because her hair is extremely fine and gets easily tangled. It was such a painful experience watching her squirm with each stroke of the hair brush. I read rave reviews on the Knot Genie and decided to try one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that the knot genie appears to work better on dry hair rather than wet hair. But I&#x27;ve also found that if I apply some Argan Nut Oil on my daughter&#x27;s wet hair before brushing, the result is great as the oil helps strengthen the hair and makes for easier brushing. My daughter loves this brush so much I&#x27;ve bought two more - one for use in school and another for when she goes swimming.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 4 year old daughter, she has long hair and she will play with it creating large knots in the back of her head.&lt;br /&gt;I got this in hopes that hair brushing won&#x27;t end in tears, and it failed. Even with detangling spray and slow careful strokes she still cries in pain. I tried it myself and it&#x27;s more painful then my regular brush.</li>
            <li> Bought 2 gave one to a friend I loved so much.....Have not used anyother brush on my 8yr old with Ld &amp; SENSORY.&lt;br /&gt;THE SUPER BRUSH---w/Aussie leave in conditiioner:-)</li>
            <li> Finally I thought there is hope for my daughter&#x27;s long hair, I was wrong. Tried it with wet hair, all it did was get stuck in all the tangles. Dry hair, same thing, piece of junk, not to mention the teeth on the brush are super sharp and my kid hated it. So back it goes, hopefully I will get my money back.</li>
            <li> My daughter has the thinnest, knottiest hair in creation.  Nothing I did ever got the knots out without pulling and tugging.  This works!  Its not painless, but it is definitely better then using a comb.  Its quick, easy, and my daughters hair looks great!  highly recommend.  As for shipping, it was pretty good!  Got this within 5/6 days .</li>
