            <li>Thank you Amazon for giving me the opportunity to purchase this wonderful product :-)</li>

            <li>Smells so good my boyfriend loves it.</li>
            <li>Based on the reviews I thought this may be a good buy.</li>
            <li>It was on good condition when I got it</li>
            <li>I know my friend will be so happy :-)    </li>
            <li>I am happy that I can still find this item on amazon at an even better price than in stores.</li>
            <li>It is very sophisticated, but not an &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li>This cologne smells great and is very strong so try not to spray more than 2 or 3 times because you will over power your nose along with everybody else.</li>
            <li>The scent is very nice and easy on the nose.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing.</li>
            <li>and because amazon classifies this as a \\&quot;flammable\\&quot; or potentially hazardous product, you can&#x27;t get a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a nice fragrance for the man.</li>
            <li>The price of about $16 for 3.3 ounces is incredible if not a farce.</li>
            <li>I love this price and the cologne was amazing.</li>
            <li>I get compliments from women all the time it, smells SO good it has a clean overtone to it</li>
            <li>Try this and see how many positive comments you receive!!!!</li>
            <li>I am fairly new to fragrances, so I don&#x27;t have the best nose, but I pick up primarily florals with a woodsy note, perhaps some sweetness from vanilla.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this product</li>
            <li>i fell in love with this cologne years ago, i&#x27;ve been using it ever since.</li>
            <li>Light and fresh smelling cologne and a great price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also my girlfriend&#x27;s favorite cologne for me to wear.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Among these $50-100 colognes, the one for under $20 is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t even looking for men&#x27;s colognes, but I&#x27;m glad I listened to him!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, if you like Ulysse and are looking for a women&#x27;s perfume, maybe you&#x27;ll also agree with my (and my girlfriend&#x27;s) favorite women&#x27;s perfume...</li>
            <li>I purchased this when I purchased Cologne for my wife made by Vicky Tiel, if you like a light spray this is the one for you!</li>
            <li>Projection, Sillage and longevity are all top notch.</li>
            <li>I wonder how it is okay for them to send the customer.</li>
            <li>Nice woodsy, but light scent for anyone who does not like an overpowering cologne.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite colognes out there.</li>
            <li>I give it away as gift to special friends, and they all love it!</li>

            <li>This cologne is right up there with the popular name brand colognes.</li>
            <li>To me it&#x27;s very mild, but stays.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was very quick</li>
            <li>Could easily pass for a feminine scent.</li>
            <li>It has a clean odor and this refreshing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ulysse has a very clean scent, not overly musky, just smells SO good (last all day, too, unlike many others).  </li>

            <li>/&gt;It is slightly sweet ,but not sickening</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>SEXY MASCULINE !!!!</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s kind of a soft, light, sweet scent.</li>
            <li>Very strong, long lasting and recognizable scent, professionally a very good job indeed.  </li>
            <li>It smells clean and fresh with a touch of citrus.</li>
            <li>I have this cologne before and its light and fresh, worth it.</li>
            <li>Homme\\&quot; (my other favorite), Oscar de la Renta, Armani Code (another nice one), etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This scent is nice for everyday not overpowering but clean and refreshing.</li>

            <li>I have 10-15 different colognes (mostly received as gifts), and my favorite cologne by far is Ulysse by Vicky Tiel (I have the Eau de Toilette).  </li>
            <li>The package came a few days earlier and the service was great!  </li>
            <li>the only redeeming quality of this is how darn pretty</li>

            <li>My husband really like the fragrance</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an expensive smelling, high quality fragrance for a very good price.  </li>
            <li>because its freshness is not flowery but somewhat unusual and intense (not sure how to best describe it, and not sure if that intense note is a hit or a bit of miss).  </li>

            <li> Its a subtle yet distinct fragrance that .  </li>
            <li> You will be shocked when smelling this cologne on how exceptional the scent is.</li>
            <li> This is one of the nicest ones I&#x27;ve purchased in a long time.</li>
            <li> It has a floral base yet at the same time smells like a nice hair shampoo/conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not bad, not great!</li>
            <li> Just goes to show that more expensive doesn&#x27;t always mean \\&quot;better\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other women (relatives</li>
            <li> I bow down...</li>
            <li> FYI, I tend to favor a little (just a little) flowery smell.  </li>
            <li> The price of this product is unbelievable in comparison with other leading brands and yet you have the quality.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift a few years ago and my cousin loves it.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine wears it and is running low and has been unable to find it any where  </li>
            <li> Hard to find.  </li>
            <li> I was browsing perfumes (for my girlfriend) in a shop in NYC 2 years ago, and the guy behind the counter told me I should try Ulysse for myself....</li>
            <li> and as I said I smell a floral base with some lavender buried in the background and a shampoo &amp;#34;pantene&amp;#34; smell with a little spice incense and citrus like a synthetic lime smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I did some reading before I blind bought this.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> it to your grandma or your worst enemy.</li>

            <li> The lower price  should not  make you think you are getting a low quality product,, its great fresh citrusy men,s  parfume</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell and long lasting</li>
            <li> I love this product. A friend of mine wears it and is running low and has been unable to find it any where  so I came online and found it for him. I think it is the perfect gift for cologne users. It smells amazing. everywhere we go if he is wearing everyone stops and smells lol. I know that sounds weird but its a good way to put reactions.   I am so pleased with this product and I can&#x27;t wait for it to arrive at my house. I know my friend will be so happy :-)    Thank you Amazon for giving me the opportunity to purchase this wonderful product :-)</li>
            <li> Not bad, not great! Worth the money!</li>
            <li> I bought like 8 bottle of different EDT from the reviews and this is one of the four I like. The others which I also like are Chrome, Ulysse, Oxygene Lanvin, &amp; Nautica Voyage. FYI, I tend to favor a little (just a little) flowery smell.  The ones i didnt like: One Man Show, Nicole Miller, Perry Ellis 360 White.  The one i hasn&#x27;t decied is ZIRH IKON.</li>
            <li> it reeks of yankee candle. the only redeeming quality of this is how darn pretty the bottle is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...and because amazon classifies this as a \\&quot;flammable\\&quot; or potentially hazardous product, you can&#x27;t get a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;give it to your grandma or your worst enemy.</li>
            <li> GREAT SMELL HOLDS OK THROUGHT THE DAY, BUT WILL LOOSE STRENGTH, GOOD FOR PRICE AND FOR A GIFT!,MABE A TEEN OR YOUNG ADULT FOR SCHOOL.</li>
            <li> i fell in love with this cologne years ago, i&#x27;ve been using it ever since. I get compliments from women all the time it, smells SO good it has a clean overtone to it i would definitely reccmend it to anyone ,you wont be disapointed</li>
            <li> I paid $60 dollars for this exact same cologne in Las Vegas. This cologne smells great and is very strong so try not to spray more than 2 or 3 times because you will over power your nose along with everybody else.</li>
            <li> What is great about Ulysse is that it doesn&#x27;t smell like teenager or the club.  Its a subtle yet distinct fragrance that .  I have had several compliments from co workers to the passerby.  It has quickly become my favorite Eau De Toilette.</li>
            <li> Very nice cologne. The smell is very different. It&#x27;s kind of a soft, light, sweet scent.</li>
            <li> This has got to be my top favorite colognes thus far. Perfect for all occasions. It has such a nice spicy yet clean refreshing scent if that makes sense and it last all day long. I always receive compliments when wearing this cologne. The best hidden secret.</li>
            <li> Smells so good my boyfriend loves it. Shipping was very quick I definitely recommend😄</li>
            <li> I have this cologne before and its light and fresh, worth it. Light and fresh smelling cologne and a great price</li>
            <li> I have 10-15 different colognes (mostly received as gifts), and my favorite cologne by far is Ulysse by Vicky Tiel (I have the Eau de Toilette).  It&#x27;s also my girlfriend&#x27;s favorite cologne for me to wear.  For the record, I also have Drakkar Noir, several Calvin Klein&#x27;s, Ralph Lauren&#x27;s, Jean Paul Gaultier \\&quot;Pour Homme\\&quot; (my other favorite), Oscar de la Renta, Armani Code (another nice one), etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Among these $50-100 colognes, the one for under $20 is my favorite.  Just goes to show that more expensive doesn&#x27;t always mean \\&quot;better\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ulysse has a very clean scent, not overly musky, just smells SO good (last all day, too, unlike many others).  I&#x27;ve had other women (relatives, co-workers comment positively on it, too).  I was browsing perfumes (for my girlfriend) in a shop in NYC 2 years ago, and the guy behind the counter told me I should try Ulysse for myself....I wasn&#x27;t even looking for men&#x27;s colognes, but I&#x27;m glad I listened to him!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, if you like Ulysse and are looking for a women&#x27;s perfume, maybe you&#x27;ll also agree with my (and my girlfriend&#x27;s) favorite women&#x27;s perfume...\\&quot;Carolina Herrera\\&quot;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000C210DC B000C210DC]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that there are a couple of different ones...the one we like is just \\&quot;Carolina Herrera\\&quot; and is in the box with the gold dots on it.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift a few years ago and my cousin loves it. Can only find on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I purchased this when I purchased Cologne for my wife made by Vicky Tiel, if you like a light spray this is the one for you!</li>
            <li> I own the the following colognes; Versace Eros, JPG Le Terrible , Chanel Allure , Bvlgari Aqva , Creed Aventus among many others. I mentioned these so that you can get a sense of the colognes i like. Yet none of all these fragrances come close to this Ulysse. OMG this cologne is a beast. Projection, Sillage and longevity are all top notch. This blows every cologne i have owned out of the park. The price of about $16 for 3.3 ounces is incredible if not a farce. I am getting another bottle. Stop reading and just buy this thing. If you don&#x27;t like it get in touch with me.. Vicky Tiel whoever the hell you are, you are a gift from the Gods..I bow down...You have created a monster that lies unheralded.</li>
            <li> Best price, scent will stay with you for over 10 hours, and I love it! I give it away as gift to special friends, and they all love it!</li>
            <li> That is my 5th bottle. The scent is very nice and easy on the nose. I would recommend it all the time.</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews I thought this may be a good buy. I don&#x27;t like it and probably not keeping this one. Goes into the donation bucket. Very incense like and flowery. Could easily pass for a feminine scent.</li>
            <li> Would advise choosing a different cologne, friends of mine agree.</li>
            <li> Smells great in my baby!!</li>
            <li> this is very good you get your money worth with this product all pro&#x27;s no cons. I will recommend this to every body.</li>
            <li> I this product because it is a Vicky Tiel. I bought an additional bottle. It is a nice fragrance for the man. It has a clean odor and this refreshing. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Value for the money is exceeded!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scent IMO can be worn by either a man or a woman. It can be worn in the summer or the winter. It has a floral base yet at the same time smells like a nice hair shampoo/conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is slightly sweet ,but not sickening and as I said I smell a floral base with some lavender buried in the background and a shampoo &amp;#34;pantene&amp;#34; smell with a little spice incense and citrus like a synthetic lime smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally never smelled anything like this IMO very unisex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its staying power lasts a pretty long time too but evolves into something else waaaay down the line (honey suckle) to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can smell this on your skin sometimes a day later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with my purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Value for the money 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;Scent 3.5 Stars&lt;br /&gt;Longevity 4 Stars</li>
            <li> Could I say that I totally love to smell this fragrance on my husband!!! It is mild yet it stays on all day long!! Some of the stores have discontinued this product - I don&#x27;t know why because it is one of the best scents in the world for men!! The package came a few days earlier and the service was great!  I will definitely use this seller again. I am happy that I can still find this item on amazon at an even better price than in stores.</li>
            <li> Very strong, long lasting and recognizable scent, professionally a very good job indeed.  4* because its freshness is not flowery but somewhat unusual and intense (not sure how to best describe it, and not sure if that intense note is a hit or a bit of miss).  Definitely daytime.  Usually sells cheaply, certainly a good value for money.</li>
            <li> my husband likes this product.</li>
            <li> For the price, this fragrance really pleases me.  I did some reading before I blind bought this.  I am fairly new to fragrances, so I don&#x27;t have the best nose, but I pick up primarily florals with a woodsy note, perhaps some sweetness from vanilla.  I would say the scent is very unique and difficult to describe, but I enjoy smelling it.  I heard somebody say it was like cream soda, and I can see that somewhat.  After several hours, it seems to leave primarily patchouli and vanilla on the skin.  Anyway, I am definitely pleased with this blind buy.</li>
            <li> Smell gives me a headache. It is neither musky nor citrus-y. There is a no return policy for perfumes since they are flammable. I wonder how it is okay for them to send the customer. I do not recommend this Eau De Toilette.</li>
            <li> I bought some of this cologne while on vacation and get lots of comments on it. I found it for a great price on Amazon and my wife is very happy. Nice woodsy, but light scent for anyone who does not like an overpowering cologne.</li>
            <li> It smells good and just little spray is enough and it holds in the dress for entire day. I recommend to others</li>
            <li> Hard to find.  Great price</li>
            <li> This scent is nice for everyday not overpowering but clean and refreshing. For the size, price, and fragrant smell it is a great choice for any age of man.</li>
            <li> This cologne is right up there with the popular name brand colognes. The price of this product is unbelievable in comparison with other leading brands and yet you have the quality. You will be shocked when smelling this cologne on how exceptional the scent is.</li>
            <li> It was on good condition when I got it</li>
            <li> smells like an old ladies laundry</li>
            <li> My husband really like the fragrance</li>
            <li> I love this price and the cologne was amazing. I will continue to buy through AMAZON.... (HINT: My husband thinks that this cologne is water, so that&#x27;s why I need to have a good deal to buy in bulk).... ; D</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of different kinds of cologne. This is one of the nicest ones I&#x27;ve purchased in a long time. It smells clean and fresh with a touch of citrus. It is very sophisticated, but not an &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; smell. It smells hip and up to date. It&#x27;s an expensive smelling, high quality fragrance for a very good price.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> This is way better than all the expensive colognes.  My husband loves this and so do I.  He even get compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Great cologne for man I&#x27;m highly recommended to everyone .all girls asking me from where it&#x27;s smells very good.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both love it!!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite colognes out there.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, and it doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.  Try this and see how many positive comments you receive!!!!</li>
            <li> Great transaction, good item.</li>
