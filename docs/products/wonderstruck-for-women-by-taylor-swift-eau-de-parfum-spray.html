            <li>She was thrilled.</li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t too strong and lasted almost all day!</li>
            <li>But then again, a lady needs no reason at all to feel beautiful or smell pretty : )</li>
            <li>Very sparkly and beautiful.</li>
            <li>It first came to my attention because I&#x27;m a Taylor Swift fan, and the description of the scent sounded very nice.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is very pretty and perfume smells really, really good:)</li>
            <li>The bottle is adorable as well.</li>
            <li>My daughter was pleased with  Wonderstruck.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>It is an excellent present for any Taylor Swift fan.</li>
            <li>Cute bottle.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume.</li>
            <li>I love anything</li>
            <li>, it does not over power a room like most perfumes do.  </li>
            <li>just love &amp; trust Amazon.  </li>
            <li>but I bought it more so because it was made by Taylor Swift</li>
            <li>I just received this perfume as a gift (it was on my Amazon wishlist), and I really love it.  </li>
            <li>and I just fell in love with the smell.</li>
            <li>i love this perfume.</li>
            <li>Like cheap perfume!</li>
            <li>I am more of a Katy Perry Purr fan, the smell lingers with that one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very nice combination, floral and vanilla, and it has good lasting power.  </li>
            <li>Again - a great, clean, fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li>Nice mild perfume.</li>
            <li>nice subtle fragrance perfect for women that don&#x27;t want to smell like they walked through a brothel</li>
            <li>(She is a HUGE Taylor Swift fan.)</li>
            <li>It kind of makes me wonder if it the real thing or an immitation perfume.</li>
            <li>I instantly feel happy when I wear it.</li>
            <li>The packaging of this product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>This is without a doubt, my new favorite perfume!</li>
            <li>The scent wasn&#x27;t necessarily for me, but it was pleasant.</li>
            <li>Not often do I add a new scent because most are too strong or sweet.</li>
            <li>Cool looking bottle, too.</li>
            <li>It is too sweet &amp; musty smelling for my taste.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too sure about buying a celebrity perfume, even though I really like Taylor Swift.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a sweet sort of smell, but it&#x27;s not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I think it is perfect for a pre-teen starting off wearing perfume on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>This is now my go to fragrance when I need to make a decision quick and get out of the house to go where I need to be.</li>
            <li>I loved this perfume in the store, but the product I received in the mail doesn&#x27;t stay on long.</li>
            <li>I hoped  ALL of Taylor Swift&#x27;s Wonderstruck would  last the AMAZING 24 hours - like my friend&#x27;s did.</li>
            <li>I bought this perfume because I got it for my sister for Christmas last year, and I loved it so much as well that I had to get myself a bottle</li>
            <li>So I got my sister&#x27;s bottle and sprayed it on my left wrist, and got my own bottle and sprayed it on my right wrist, and compared how they smelled.</li>
            <li>The order came right on time.  </li>
            <li>Perfect present for a Taylor Swift fan, or little girl.</li>
            <li>The perfume bottle itself is really nice and overall, it really can be described as leaving me wonderstruck.</li>
            <li>My sister loves this perfume or I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered it without smelling it first.</li>
            <li>but this has such a light, sweet scent to it</li>
            <li>3 stars only because I do really love this perfume.</li>
            <li>Just like the other reviews, it is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This is not bad as a gift for a pre-teen because of the price and the cuteness of the bottle, but not for a 25 year old woman like me.</li>
            <li>Its a soft but sweet smell and not over powering.</li>
            <li>so I feel it should be much cheaper.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is the same - it is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I was very surprized to see it in my mailbox on December 23rd.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Taylor seems to have a knack for blending class, and modern.</li>
            <li>When I wore hers to work, it lasted my whole shift, and I could still smell it on me after I got home.</li>
            <li>I have bought better perfumes for this price, and this one doesn&#x27;t smell bad, it just has that strong acidic scent that Versace Bright Crystal has, but it doesn&#x27;t even last!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve worn this fragrance to work (I work in a professional office in Washington D.C.) without a second thought.&lt;br /&gt;Great for a date night or just no reason at all; this fragrance makes me feel lovely and feminine and young.</li>
            <li>MY 19 yr old even wants a bottle</li>
            <li>I am 37 years old and very picky about the perfume I wear.</li>
            <li>I can totally imagine wearing this scent everyday because it&#x27;s not a LOOK-AT-ME-I&#x27;M-WEARING-SUPER-OVERPOWERING-PERFUME kind of perfume.</li>
            <li>Lovely fragrance--not too heavy!</li>
            <li>I keep the small bottle in my purse - and use it more frequently.  </li>
            <li>Taylor Swift naturally targets children</li>
            <li>And I am 60 years old when I Ren Out</li>
            <li>I purchased \\&quot;Wonderstruck\\&quot; for my 12 yr old daughter for Christmas because she has been asking for it the minute it came out.  </li>
            <li>have never purchased a &amp;#34;celebrity fragrance&amp;#34; before - this truly surprised me.</li>
            <li>The bottle is super pretty and whimsical.</li>

            <li> The bottle is super pretty and whimsical.</li>
            <li> So, I ordered one large bottle from Amazon, then RUSHED out, and bought a small bottle locally.  </li>
            <li> I found Taylor Swift perfume too costly for my 15 year old &amp; other kids.</li>
            <li> Bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> , it was alot bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> but it was my fault for waiting so long to order it.  </li>
            <li> Now I wore my sister&#x27;s perfume to work before, so I had an idea on how long it lasted.</li>
            <li> Also, the two bottles I have last just as long as any other typical Perfume spray.  </li>
            <li> I bought this present for my little sister.</li>
            <li> I do not really like this perfume</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m picky, plain and simple.</li>
            <li> The down side is the price...very expensive for a first time product.</li>
            <li> This one that I just purchased, it faded half way through my shift..</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous getting her perfume at her age</li>
            <li> I was a little bummed</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Raspberry, Dewberry, Green tea, Freesia, Apple blossom</li>
            <li> a lift, but also a slight amberish musk and a must have for the tasteful lady/woman/girl who has a hard to please fragrance palette.</li>
            <li> after I got home, I could hardly even smell it anymore.</li>
            <li> At least I&#x27;ve learned to not buy it again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was watered down, or if it just went bad or is going bad</li>
            <li> Well, I bought this perfume blindly.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t too expensive in my opinion for what it was.</li>
            <li> My taste is expensive but I like a bargain.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> (which would explain the sale, they want them out of their warehouse), but I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m overseas so buying gifts for birthdays and holidays is done online. My sister loves this perfume or I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered it without smelling it first. The order came right on time.  Sister said it was in great condition and smelled just like if she would have bought it at the store. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I found Taylor Swift perfume too costly for my 15 year old &amp; other kids. Taylor Swift naturally targets children so I feel it should be much cheaper. I wish I hadn&#x27;t purchased this product &amp; won&#x27;t be buying product such as this for a child again.</li>
            <li> I smell delightful all of the time now! This is without a doubt, my new favorite perfume! The bottle is adorable as well.</li>
            <li> My daughter was pleased with  Wonderstruck.It was a Christmas present.The down side is the price...very expensive for a first time product.</li>
            <li> Lovely fragrance--not too heavy! Not often do I add a new scent because most are too strong or sweet. This is perfect!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. Just like the other reviews, it is amazing.  But - there seems to be some inconsistency with the strength.  A friend of mine bought a bottle - I used hers, and it lasted almost 24 hours on my skin. So, I ordered one large bottle from Amazon, then RUSHED out, and bought a small bottle locally.  Neither of the bottles which I bought have the strength  that my friend&#x27;s had.  The fragrance is the same - it is fantastic.  Also, the two bottles I have last just as long as any other typical Perfume spray.  I hoped  ALL of Taylor Swift&#x27;s Wonderstruck would  last the AMAZING 24 hours - like my friend&#x27;s did. I keep the small bottle in my purse - and use it more frequently.  Again - a great, clean, fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li> Had this before so had to get it again love this so much, an beautiful bottle</li>
            <li> I loved this perfume in the store, but the product I received in the mail doesn&#x27;t stay on long. It kind of makes me wonder if it the real thing or an immitation perfume.</li>
            <li> great fragance!!  amazing package and bottle.. and best of all... My daughter loves it. It is an excellent present for any Taylor Swift fan.</li>
            <li> I got this as a Christmas present. The bottle is very pretty and perfume smells really, really good:) The scent isn&#x27;t too strong and lasted almost all day! I definitely recommend you buy this.</li>
            <li> I had smelled this in a retail store, liked it, but decided to buy on Amazon for the great price. It smells really beautiful. Fruity and floral. I would definitely recommend. Cool looking bottle, too.</li>
            <li> Well, I bought this perfume blindly. I had never even smelled it before, but I wish I had beforehand! If I would have I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it. It is too sweet &amp; musty smelling for my taste. At least I&#x27;ve learned to not buy it again!</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter</li>
            <li> Christmas present for daughter. She was thrilled. Cute bottle. Bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> Great alternative to Dior Addict and alot cheaper. definitely a perfume i would recommend for an alternative to dior addict</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. Every time I wear it I feel like a fairy. The flower &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; smell is amazing!</li>
            <li> I love anything Taylor  Swift and it sells really great!!!!!!!! And I am 60 years old when I Ren Out I would order again.</li>
            <li> I bought this present for my little sister. The scent wasn&#x27;t necessarily for me, but it was pleasant. The bottle is super pretty and whimsical. Perfect present for a Taylor Swift fan, or little girl. Wasn&#x27;t too expensive in my opinion for what it was.</li>
            <li> I purchased \\&quot;Wonderstruck\\&quot; for my 12 yr old daughter for Christmas because she has been asking for it the minute it came out.  (She is a HUGE Taylor Swift fan.) I was a little nervous getting her perfume at her age but this has such a light, sweet scent to it, it does not over power a room like most perfumes do.  I think it is perfect for a pre-teen starting off wearing perfume on a daily basis.  MY 19 yr old even wants a bottle now!&lt;br /&gt;I got her the 1.7 oz bottle and I have to say, it was alot bigger than I expected. The bottle itself is beautiful on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wanted to say I ordered this last minute on the night of December 18th &amp; was told it would not be here until after Christmas. I was a little bummed but it was my fault for waiting so long to order it.  I was very surprized to see it in my mailbox on December 23rd.&lt;br /&gt;I just love &amp; trust Amazon.  They are the best!!!  Thank you !!</li>
            <li> I do not really like this perfume but I bought it more so because it was made by Taylor Swift</li>
            <li> I just received this perfume as a gift (it was on my Amazon wishlist), and I really love it.  It first came to my attention because I&#x27;m a Taylor Swift fan, and the description of the scent sounded very nice.  It&#x27;s a very nice combination, floral and vanilla, and it has good lasting power.  I definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> This perfume SMELLS so good. I wasn&#x27;t too sure about buying a celebrity perfume, even though I really like Taylor Swift. I went to Macy&#x27;s one time and I smelled Wonderstruck there and I just fell in love with the smell. It&#x27;s got a sweet sort of smell, but it&#x27;s not overpowering. I can totally imagine wearing this scent everyday because it&#x27;s not a LOOK-AT-ME-I&#x27;M-WEARING-SUPER-OVERPOWERING-PERFUME kind of perfume. The perfume bottle itself is really nice and overall, it really can be described as leaving me wonderstruck.</li>
            <li> I am 37 years old and very picky about the perfume I wear. This scent is gorgeous. Very sparkly and beautiful. Lasts all day. I can detect the scent still on my skin hours after I apply it. Wearing this fragrance is a great mood booster. I instantly feel happy when I wear it. Sometimes I put it on for no reason at all.  But then again, a lady needs no reason at all to feel beautiful or smell pretty : )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;Basenotes&amp;#34; perfume website lists the fragrance notes as:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Top Notes&lt;br /&gt;Raspberry, Dewberry, Green tea, Freesia, Apple blossom&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Middle Notes&lt;br /&gt;Vanilla, Honeysuckle, White hibiscus&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Base Notes&lt;br /&gt;Amber, Musk, Sandalwood, Peach&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never purchased a &amp;#34;celebrity fragrance&amp;#34; before - this truly surprised me. I had no idea what I was going to end up with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve worn this fragrance to work (I work in a professional office in Washington D.C.) without a second thought.&lt;br /&gt;Great for a date night or just no reason at all; this fragrance makes me feel lovely and feminine and young.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m picky, plain and simple. My taste is expensive but I like a bargain. Taylor seems to have a knack for blending class, and modern. This is now my go to fragrance when I need to make a decision quick and get out of the house to go where I need to be. It ha a lift, but also a slight amberish musk and a must have for the tasteful lady/woman/girl who has a hard to please fragrance palette. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> i love this perfume. nice subtle fragrance perfect for women that don&#x27;t want to smell like they walked through a brothel</li>
            <li> I have bought better perfumes for this price, and this one doesn&#x27;t smell bad, it just has that strong acidic scent that Versace Bright Crystal has, but it doesn&#x27;t even last! Like cheap perfume! I think I used it one day and I probably had to keep spraying myself about 5 times during the day because the scent kept fading. I am more of a Katy Perry Purr fan, the smell lingers with that one. This is not bad as a gift for a pre-teen because of the price and the cuteness of the bottle, but not for a 25 year old woman like me.</li>
            <li> I like this perfume the best out of all the ones I have purchased before.  Its a soft but sweet smell and not over powering.</li>
            <li> 3 stars only because I do really love this perfume. However; please be cautious when buying this. I bought this perfume because I got it for my sister for Christmas last year, and I loved it so much as well that I had to get myself a bottle, I saw these on sale and decided to pick one up. When I wore this to work, I noticed that it smelled a bit different; but I couldn&#x27;t quite put my finger on it. Now I wore my sister&#x27;s perfume to work before, so I had an idea on how long it lasted. When I wore hers to work, it lasted my whole shift, and I could still smell it on me after I got home. This one that I just purchased, it faded half way through my shift.. after I got home, I could hardly even smell it anymore. So I got my sister&#x27;s bottle and sprayed it on my left wrist, and got my own bottle and sprayed it on my right wrist, and compared how they smelled. This one definitely smells a lot weaker than the one I got my sister. I&#x27;m not sure if it was watered down, or if it just went bad or is going bad (which would explain the sale, they want them out of their warehouse), but I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and decided to buy this even though I hadn&#x27;t smelled it. It&#x27;s really great! Everyone always complements me on it. Hints of vanilla</li>
            <li> The packaging of this product is fantastic. Bought this for my wife for valentines day.  She was very impressed.  Nice mild perfume.</li>
