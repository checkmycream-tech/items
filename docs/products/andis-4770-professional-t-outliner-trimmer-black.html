            <li>I would have loved to use these trimmers, although they got to my house 2days late and on top of that they didn&#x27;t even work!</li>
            <li>Did a quick test and pug it in and works well.</li>
            <li>Andis hands down makes the most popular T-Outliner in the biz.</li>
            <li>Great trimmer but the screw closest to the on/off switch was missing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not to light or not to heavy and feels good in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for edging hair.&lt;br /&gt;Gets</li>
            <li>(I broke the first one right away by dropping it right on the blade....</li>
            <li>It took me a whole week just to get a return address from beauty motion !</li>
            <li>to yes it does get hot even hotter than i would have thought</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>This trimmer does get hot but is manageable.</li>
            <li>they just get hot</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was concerned about it getting hot during extended runs.  </li>
            <li>Bought these for my nephew and he absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>Trimmers cut well, but the blade broke on the first fall to the floor.</li>
            <li>Is there a better product for getting a closer dry shave?</li>
            <li>Very unsatisified</li>
            <li>It take too much time to write a review for all of these things.</li>
            <li>that cost 2x as much.</li>
            <li>For years,  I relied on these cheap over the counter trimmers from the big box stores&lt;br</li>
            <li>thanks ANDI</li>
            <li>I use this to shave my head and beard and it is a very close shave.</li>
            <li>Conveniently long cord and easy on and off switch.</li>
            <li>It vibrates quite a bit seeing as the motor inside is constantly on high since this razor plugs into the wall.  </li>
            <li>keeps the line looking clean for a long time and does the job</li>
            <li>the finest of hair so you rarely have to go back with a razor blade do edge.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>Amazon Shipping:&lt;br /&gt;I am currently a member of Amazon Prime and this item came right on time.</li>
            <li>I do the basic &#x27;number 1&#x27; all the way around my head and use the Andis T-Outliner to keep the edges nice and tight.  </li>
            <li>I now have to buy new blades.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item twice and the same thing happened to both the blades would stop working and when j tried to oil it up a bit and clean it it continued to do the same.</li>
            <li>Love it, getting prepared to start cutting hair and going to enjoy this.</li>
            <li>Definitely would recommend to my friends and family or anyone who wants to learn to outline their hair.</li>
            <li>same performance as the classic gray....</li>
            <li>I really like this Andis 4770 T-Outliner as I have been cutting my own hair now for about 2 years.  </li>
            <li>This is a must have with anyone that has problems using regular razors with shaving that can cause razor bumps because of having very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I do not recommend ordering your work equipment from beauty motion especially if your as busy as I am and need your tools in a timely fashion!</li>
            <li>Blade is not sharp at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using it for a long amount of time this T-Outliner gets really hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would totally buy this product again once it breaks.</li>

            <li> /&gt;After using it for a long amount of time this T-Outliner gets really hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would totally buy this product again once it breaks.</li>
            <li> and the cordless ones never seemed to last long.</li>
            <li> I usually end up with in-grown hair with other trimmers but this one does it just right.</li>
            <li> Tight cuts and definitely professional grade.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sharper, less irritating, and more flexible than any other  </li>
            <li> I have the styler and the outliner2 and decided to get this one for the line up and dry</li>
            <li> the color black instead of the same color like everyone else</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s surprisingly quiet and felt vibration is much less than I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe i´m wrong or i´m not so lucky</li>
            <li> expected.&lt;br /&gt;Disassembly for cleaning is simple and only requires a Phillips screwdriver.&lt;br /&gt;Re-assembly requires a bit of a critical eye, but if you slow down and work carefully&lt;</li>
            <li> shave not what I expected</li>
            <li> The product works well but does not shave as close as I expected or was lead to believe.</li>
            <li> too quick.they cut sharp</li>
            <li> wife has the same complaint regarding the cord when she uses the Andis to cut my hair (she is an RN and not a hair stylist by the way</li>
            <li> My only negative about this razor is that it has a heavy duty/thick cord.  </li>
            <li> This tool is definitely heavy duty as you can tell once you turn it on.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone in the market for a heavy duty pair of clippers.</li>
            <li> broke a few days after i could not finish my lineup</li>
            <li> cord is heavy duty and the length is quite sufficient.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Heavy Duty Timmer, just want I needed.</li>
            <li> I still gave it a chance &amp; barely after a few strands of hair the blades got stuck &amp; the motor sounded weird.</li>
            <li> its hard do even a buzz cut.  </li>
            <li> Also, hard to figure out which coomb set fits this clipper head.</li>
            <li> before giving a low humming noise and stop cutting, I did like the look of the clippers, and had they worked correctly</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t look at the negative comments</li>
            <li> I wanted a pair of clippers that could both give a close shave, and for cutting in my beard lines.</li>
            <li> very difficult to adjusting.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it made me look stupid</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great set of clippers!</li>
            <li> This item stopped working. I purchased this item twice and the same thing happened to both the blades would stop working and when j tried to oil it up a bit and clean it it continued to do the same. Cheaply made. Very unsatisified</li>
            <li> same performance as the classic gray....but Black is way more sexy!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It is still working great for me. This is a must have with anyone that has problems using regular razors with shaving that can cause razor bumps because of having very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this Andis 4770 T-Outliner as I have been cutting my own hair now for about 2 years.  I do the basic &#x27;number 1&#x27; all the way around my head and use the Andis T-Outliner to keep the edges nice and tight.  This tool is definitely heavy duty as you can tell once you turn it on.  It vibrates quite a bit seeing as the motor inside is constantly on high since this razor plugs into the wall.  My only negative about this razor is that it has a heavy duty/thick cord.  Now this is nice for the fact that your razor will never run out of juice but I will admit that the cord does become a hassle sometimes (especially when doing my hair myself).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife has the same complaint regarding the cord when she uses the Andis to cut my hair (she is an RN and not a hair stylist by the way (: )  Anyways, all in all I think this is a great product and I have in fact bought 2 of these (I broke the first one right away by dropping it right on the blade....woops, definite user error).  I would recommend this to anyone in the market for a heavy duty pair of clippers.</li>
            <li> Used friends T-blades before and they were perfect. I now have my own and i can get my close shave all the time! :)</li>
            <li> If you want me to review, STOP requiring a set of word or any at all. It take too much time to write a review for all of these things.</li>
            <li> If you looking for a reliable trimmer that can do the job this is one. Great making designs on beard and shape up&#x27;s</li>
            <li> just what i was looking for and needed works great love the color black instead of the same color like everyone else</li>
            <li> I would have loved to use these trimmers, although they got to my house 2days late and on top of that they didn&#x27;t even work! It took me a whole week just to get a return address from beauty motion ! I do not recommend ordering your work equipment from beauty motion especially if your as busy as I am and need your tools in a timely fashion!</li>
            <li> Andis hands down makes the most popular T-Outliner in the biz. It&#x27;s sharper, less irritating, and more flexible than any other  in it&#x27;s class. I could go on and on, but ask yourself &amp;#34;how many people shave with head hair liners?&lt;br /&gt; There is no indication for using these to shave with, yet they offer you to shave with them and compare the results with those &amp;#34;shavers&amp;#34; that cost 2x as much. Who else makes such a challenge?</li>
            <li> I probably just got a defective item, but the clippers only worked for about 5 min. before giving a low humming noise and stop cutting, I did like the look of the clippers, and had they worked correctly I&#x27;m sure I would have loved them.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is amazing it definitely does what its supposed to yes it does get hot even hotter than i would have thought but its man made lol don&#x27;t look at the negative comments buy it enjoy it if not return it its a win/win</li>
            <li> Bought this for my fiance as he was searching high and low for the best beard trimmer out there. He absolutely loves it and it gives him the perfect trim.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery! Great Item! Item just as described!</li>
            <li> This trimmer gets the job done. For years,  I relied on these cheap over the counter trimmers from the big box stores&lt;br /&gt; and the cordless ones never seemed to last long. I would say after three weeks of using this trimmer, I am satisfied with the result. This trimmer does get hot but is manageable.</li>
            <li> Great clippers to outline your tape. Definitely would recommend to my friends and family or anyone who wants to learn to outline their hair.</li>
            <li> broke a few days after i could not finish my lineup and it made me look stupid thanks ANDI</li>
            <li> Use it to bald my head. Gets job done. I&#x27;ve had andis trimmers before and these are the best I&#x27;ve used so far</li>
            <li> As someone stated before this item is used. The packaging was fishy. The box didn&#x27;t even have tape at the top nor bottom. The item itself looked scratched &amp; had fingerprints. I still gave it a chance &amp; barely after a few strands of hair the blades got stuck &amp; the motor sounded weird. My $30 dollar Andis trimmer worked better than this garbage. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone. Returning ASAP.</li>
            <li> I am always buying trimmers to cut my hair..  I am thinning at the top so i just buzz cut.  So far this is the best trimmer i have ever used.  My hair grows in three different directions so its hard do even a buzz cut.  I usually end up with in-grown hair with other trimmers but this one does it just right.</li>
            <li> Nice pair of clippers. I wanted a pair of clippers that could both give a close shave, and for cutting in my beard lines. And for the price you can&#x27;t beat them.</li>
            <li> I´m not so happy with this tool.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe i´m wrong or i´m not so lucky but this Andis T- Outliner make a strong noise and it´s very difficult to adjusting.&lt;br /&gt;Now i could say it´s working so so, but i´ll never buy another one.</li>
            <li> Very good trimmer! I love most And is products over Oster!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get better, thing works like a charm. Tight cuts and definitely professional grade. Make sure to keep oiled and cleaned for it to work optimally. Getting a cleaner spray is absolutely necessary.</li>
            <li> It is the best trimmer I ever had!!!!  I&#x27;ll recommend to anybody. Andis products are the best. thanks for making all this great things for use.</li>
            <li> they work fine they just get hot too quick.they cut sharp a promate blade works good too sharpen it and your good to go.</li>
            <li> Amazon continues to amaze me with the level of service that I expect and deserve!</li>
            <li> Cuts greats! This is the best set of clippers I have ever owed in my life. I challenge anybody to use these also!</li>
            <li> Blade is not sharp at all.I have the styler and the outliner2 and decided to get this one for the line up and dry shave not what I expected</li>
            <li> Great product. Met all my expectations. Very easy to use and adjust. Conveniently long cord and easy on and off switch.</li>
            <li> Love it, getting prepared to start cutting hair and going to enjoy this. Did a quick test and pug it in and works well. Glad I bought this .</li>
            <li> The product works well but does not shave as close as I expected or was lead to believe. Is there a better product for getting a closer dry shave?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer almost daily for about a month now.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted something that plugged in and was not battery operated.&lt;br /&gt;The cord is heavy duty and the length is quite sufficient.&lt;br /&gt;It has exceeded my expectations for performance.&lt;br /&gt;It was concerned about it getting hot during extended runs.  It does get warm, but not hot.&lt;br /&gt;(I put one drop of oil on each end of the cutter each time before use)&lt;br /&gt;I was also concerned about it trimming very coarse mustache and beard hair,&lt;br /&gt;but it handles both with ease.  It&#x27;s surprisingly quiet and felt vibration is much less than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;Disassembly for cleaning is simple and only requires a Phillips screwdriver.&lt;br /&gt;Re-assembly requires a bit of a critical eye, but if you slow down and work carefully&lt;br /&gt;you&#x27;ll do fine.  It isn&#x27;t complicated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about the Andis trimmer is, (it&#x27;s a BIG thing for me)&lt;br /&gt;you can order repair parts when needed and fix it yourself, or you can choose&lt;br /&gt;an authorized repair station and let them do the repair work.&lt;br /&gt;Who would have thought?  A trimmer that is designed to be repaired!&lt;br /&gt;Five stars for sure.&lt;br /&gt;When my Wahl clippers die, I plan to replace them with something from Andis.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my nephew and he absolutely loves it! He&#x27;s now making a couple of dollars in college! Exciting!</li>
            <li> These Trimmers work great!!! Way better than I thought they would be. I think I&#x27;m going to buy 2 more!!!</li>
            <li> best all around trimmer ive ever had. keeps the line looking clean for a long time and does the job</li>
            <li> Trimmers cut well, but the blade broke on the first fall to the floor. I now have to buy new blades.</li>
            <li> Amazon Shipping:&lt;br /&gt;I am currently a member of Amazon Prime and this item came right on time. Thumbs up for Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why did I buy this product?&lt;br /&gt;Before buying this T-Outliner I did many reviews on Youtube and found that these gave the most perfect lines and edging possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likes:&lt;br /&gt;It is not to light or not to heavy and feels good in your hand.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for edging hair.&lt;br /&gt;Gets the finest of hair so you rarely have to go back with a razor blade do edge.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to fix and take item apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes:&lt;br /&gt;After using it for a long amount of time this T-Outliner gets really hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would totally buy this product again once it breaks.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer but the screw closest to the on/off switch was missing.  Also, hard to figure out which coomb set fits this clipper head.</li>
            <li> I use this to shave my head and beard and it is a very close shave.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Its perfect for what I needed it.  :)</li>
            <li> just what I needed I&#x27;m still using it</li>
            <li> Heavy Duty Timmer, just want I needed.</li>
