            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>Ok... So i bought an instyler.</li>
            <li>I researched more about it</li>
            <li>This is an OK product.</li>
            <li>but whatever, lol highly recommend this..</li>
            <li>It really does the trick quickly and takes care of my frizz and fly aways.  </li>
            <li>but then other times was perfect.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;very easy</li>
            <li>is so easy to use</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s so easy to use.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing and an absolute life saver!</li>
            <li>I have fine, curly hair</li>
            <li>Luckily, I was able to hide it while it healed.  </li>
            <li>If anything, I thought it felt light and materials</li>
            <li>as soon as the hinge stopped closely smoothly, I ordered another.  </li>
            <li>I think this Product is excellent for people with more naturally straight/wavy/ fine hair as it would be easier to use and less of a hassle.</li>
            <li>excellent quality and leaves hair soft, silky and shiny hair, the better to resolve at home arranging my hair and my child and not burn the hair like other irons</li>
            <li>The silver roller gets very hot.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I see myself using it daily, but I&#x27;m glad I purchased it all-in-all!</li>
            <li>so yeah i&#x27;ve learned some pretty cool stuff with this thing..</li>
            <li>I would not pay full price for this hot iron.</li>
            <li>I was right.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super excited sbout my new toy.</li>
            <li>Really nothing special, and takes a bit of practice to use and not get it caught in your hair.  </li>
            <li>the first time I used it didn&#x27;t work out so well...came out pretty puffy and reverted quickly, but I am getting the hang of it now as the second time it came out much better.</li>
            <li>works great hard to get the hang of when using</li>
            <li>While it does get the hair very straight, it also creates much more volume and a definite bend to the ends of the hair.  </li>
            <li>Exactly As I wanted ..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the instyler for... since it first came out.</li>
            <li>I burnt my forehead the first time I tried to iron my side-bangs.  </li>
            <li>so they could see that when it is hot, it smokes.  </li>
            <li>My coworker has been raving about this hot iron</li>
            <li>Thanks for the scare!</li>
            <li>First let me say that I have coarse/curly hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-hairstyle does not last more than 2 days&lt;</li>
            <li>My first one lasted five years ....</li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t live without my InStyler!!</li>
            <li>It works fast, and my hair feels soft and looks super shiny.</li>
            <li>I am AA with mixture of 4B/3C fine low density texlaxed hair.</li>
            <li>Important or else you will be left with puffy roots and straight ends.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and often soend hours and money at the salon to straighten it.</li>
            <li>It is a bit noisy, but doesn&#x27;t bother me much.</li>
            <li>Even on it&#x27;s highest settings it didn&#x27;t work well on my very curly hair.</li>
            <li>I really give this 3.5 stars...</li>
            <li>I use this after blow drying my hair to smooth the coarse hair and turn the ends under.</li>
            <li>When I use it to straighten or curl it adds so much body, volume and life to my hair.  </li>
            <li>and I get my hair done really fast.</li>
            <li>Yes it does the job fast.</li>
            <li>I think that this product leaves the hair very silky and sleek</li>
            <li>however it is VERY.</li>
            <li>but it took me much longer.</li>
            <li>My hair naturally is very frizzy and curly.</li>
            <li>I have used this hot iron a couple times now to straighten my hair and each time I find myself grabbing for my old hair straightener to really get my hair straightened.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, decent priced item</li>
            <li>It not only straightens hair super fast</li>
            <li>was great until 4-5 months later , it just abruptly stopped in the middle of straightening my hair.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It does take a bit longer than flat-ironing and is a little more work than I&#x27;m used to, so</li>
            <li>This really smooths my naturally curly hair well.  </li>
            <li>Also my hair is very dry, so more washing is a big no.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>then I bought a new one going maybe my hair was tangled in that spot.</li>
            <li>this just doesnt get hot enough to hold a curl.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling sooooo soft too!  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;-hair gets very greasy after only few days, gets more humidity prone</li>
            <li>I personally like it and plan to keep it around for special occasions or days when I want that extra bit of va-va-voom.  </li>
            <li>Made my hair shiny and frizz free with way less product than a straightening iron.</li>
            <li>Was so glade to fine it at a little cheaper price.</li>
            <li>a little cheap.</li>
            <li>The InStyler has completely changed that.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t stay hot for very long at all.</li>
            <li>It is rather large and a bit heavy, so expect to fumble a bit when first using this iron.  </li>
            <li>I thought wow it&#x27;s not to take as long for getting ready in the Morning.it</li>
            <li>I do feel like this would have more uses for shorter hair, because it is capable of creating some serious volume, but not for my long hair.</li>
            <li>I have used the IN Styler for years and finally had to order a new one.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t burn my hair and took same amount of time to straighten my whole head as a regular straightener (30 minutes with my hair being air dried, super wavy and frizzy)</li>
            <li>i have long thick slightly curly hair and when i want a nice sleek look the instyler is ready to go</li>
            <li>and I generally have to resort to washing it and that leads to styling all over&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was an early birthday present for myself this year.  </li>
            <li>but I had to use my flat iron to contact my roots in order to have a complete look.</li>
            <li>I would happily send the bad one back</li>
            <li>I have long hair to the middle of my back, and I use this mainly to polish the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li>Not sure is it worth it 100</li>
            <li>are few things I first noticed about it:&lt;br /&gt;positives:&lt;br</li>
            <li>it requires less heat to achieve a smooth, polished look, and thus is less damaging to the hair.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought I&#x27;d hate it because it wasn&#x27;t straightening or making it less frizzy, but after a few minutes of figuring out the rotation, it worked great!!!</li>
            <li>I grew up with several hair professionals in my family so having been used to my routine of blow drying my hair straight and then using a 450 degree hair straightener in one hand and a brush in the other to tame my very course,</li>

            <li> My whole life I have struggled with limp and flat hair.  </li>
            <li> Whereas with a flat iron, you&#x27;re just pressing the hair flat, which can result in hair that is limp and lacking volume and still has some kinks and waves, especially near the root.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised that it is wirking only in electricity of 120 only which is very weak and no more available in the new buildings of our country..</li>
            <li> This is an essential tool for second day hair when my natural wave starts coming back in odd places!</li>
            <li> It usually takes to heat very well and had no problem curling.</li>
            <li> i will never use a Flat iron again..</li>
            <li> Also, the rotating barrel only moves in one direction, so one side of the head is quite simple to iron while the other is more difficult.  </li>
            <li> This rotating hot iron does straighten and curl hair, but it doesn&#x27;t do neither of them well on thick long coarse hair.</li>
            <li> And from reading the other reviews, my hand only accidentally hit the power button once out of daily use in last two weeks so that wasn&#x27;t an issue either.    </li>
            <li> I have long hair and the InStyler</li>
            <li> On the left side of the head, it actually moves against the lay of the cuticle and almost teases the section of hair, rather than smoothing it down.  </li>
            <li> Also, be very careful around the hairline and forehead, especially if you wear bangs.  </li>
            <li> but I like to blow dry that anyways.</li>
            <li> but this product made my hair very dry and smell burnt all day long.</li>
            <li> Doesnt work likeI expected.</li>
            <li> After quite a few swipes and manipulation it finally got to my desired shape.</li>
            <li> really I spent my money on this</li>
            <li> Faster than any other hair tool I have used.</li>
            <li> If you have coarse/curly hair like me you know that getting the roots is EXTREMELY.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but can&#x27;t live without one!  </li>
            <li> i can take a shower and do my hair in less time</li>
            <li> so when I used InStyler my hair was sort of wavy, and still there is some frizz, but much less than usually.&lt;br</li>
            <li> everyone uses the little comb thing to get the poof</li>
            <li> My hair is usually frizzy &amp; unmanageable.</li>
            <li> My hair is over 30 inches long, I get expensive brazilian blowout done and washing often will wash out the treatment.</li>
            <li> long, thick wavy hair, I was skeptical about this max 410 degree iron.  </li>
            <li> Hard to reach and straighten the roots.</li>
            <li> I also found it was hard to get the shape I wanted at the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> It seems to work well with a different hair type from reading and watching reviews, but not with mine - it&#x27;s been disappointing.</li>
            <li> I tried it in my sister&#x27;s old home &amp; it was weak and no styles can be done with it!!!</li>
            <li> I think it can get frizz out of very thick, frizz prone hair.</li>
            <li> im just doing it wrong.</li>
            <li> So you have to either maneuver your arm behind your head or hold the iron in your non-dominant hand, which can be awkward and difficult.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is an amazing product! I have very curly hair and often soend hours and money at the salon to straighten it. Not anymore! It not only straightens hair super fast but it leaves it shiny. I&#x27;m super excited sbout my new toy.</li>
            <li> the stupidest ever  after 4 times it is stopped working &amp; expensive &amp; the brush so stupid  the hair sticks inside the roller</li>
            <li> I have long hair to the middle of my back, and I use this mainly to polish the ends of my hair. It works fast, and my hair feels soft and looks super shiny. I do feel like this would have more uses for shorter hair, because it is capable of creating some serious volume, but not for my long hair. Maybe if I had some shorter layers... However, I have used it to curl my hair, and it works like a charm! Faster than any other hair tool I have used. It is a bit noisy, but doesn&#x27;t bother me much. I would totally recommend the instyler!</li>
            <li> Exactly As I wanted ..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the instyler for... since it first came out. maybe 5 years now?&lt;br /&gt;i use to only to straighten my hair.. i have a curling wand that i use to curl my hair.&lt;br /&gt;because this just doesnt get hot enough to hold a curl. but I HAVE.. wrapped my hair up in instyler&lt;br /&gt;and hold it at my roots for 60 seconds each curl then let it out and hair spray it.. and it will stay most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;normally falls out.. but when i use my curling wand it hold a curl all and &amp;; no hair spray. but i use this also&lt;br /&gt;to tease my hair. everyone uses the little comb thing to get the poof i just put the instyler at my root and hold it. (barrel on inside)&lt;br /&gt;and it gives me a lift.. stays ALL day.. so yeah i&#x27;ve learned some pretty cool stuff with this thing.. i&#x27;ve dropped it ive stepped on it&lt;br /&gt;ive kicked it its been on maybe 10 moves and 5 vacations.. lol like this is a great product..&lt;br /&gt;very easy to use anyone can use it.. i will never use a Flat iron again.. &amp;&amp; all these years this still adds shine to my hair&lt;br /&gt;every time i use it.. it will curl your hair yes.. but your gonna have to take extra time using this product then an actual wand.&lt;br /&gt;maybe im just doing it wrong. but whatever, lol highly recommend this..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still a bit undecided about this product.  I do like that it requires less heat to achieve a smooth, polished look, and thus is less damaging to the hair.  However, adjusting to the way this product feels in the hand as well as how it is used in the hair is a challenge.  It is rather large and a bit heavy, so expect to fumble a bit when first using this iron.  Also, the rotating barrel only moves in one direction, so one side of the head is quite simple to iron while the other is more difficult.  On the left side of the head, it actually moves against the lay of the cuticle and almost teases the section of hair, rather than smoothing it down.  So you have to either maneuver your arm behind your head or hold the iron in your non-dominant hand, which can be awkward and difficult.  Also, be very careful around the hairline and forehead, especially if you wear bangs.  I burnt my forehead the first time I tried to iron my side-bangs.  Luckily, I was able to hide it while it healed.  But it definitely wasn&#x27;t cute!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The end result with the in-styler is not the same as what you achieve with a flat-iron.  While it does get the hair very straight, it also creates much more volume and a definite bend to the ends of the hair.  Basically, it resembles a blow-out you&#x27;d get at the salon.  Whereas with a flat iron, you&#x27;re just pressing the hair flat, which can result in hair that is limp and lacking volume and still has some kinks and waves, especially near the root.  So I think it all depends on what you&#x27;re hoping to achieve with this product.  I personally like it and plan to keep it around for special occasions or days when I want that extra bit of va-va-voom.  It does take a bit longer than flat-ironing and is a little more work than I&#x27;m used to, so I don&#x27;t know if I see myself using it daily, but I&#x27;m glad I purchased it all-in-all!</li>
            <li> I was surprised that it is wirking only in electricity of 120 only which is very weak and no more available in the new buildings of our country.. I tried it in my sister&#x27;s old home &amp; it was weak and no styles can be done with it!!! I lost my money!!</li>
            <li> This rotating hot iron does straighten and curl hair, but it doesn&#x27;t do neither of them well on thick long coarse hair. I have used this hot iron a couple times now to straighten my hair and each time I find myself grabbing for my old hair straightener to really get my hair straightened. It&#x27;s the same thing with curling hair. I would not pay full price for this hot iron. It seems to work well with a different hair type from reading and watching reviews, but not with mine - it&#x27;s been disappointing.</li>
            <li> had one and used it up and so got another one.  works great.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> excellent quality and leaves hair soft, silky and shiny hair, the better to resolve at home arranging my hair and my child and not burn the hair like other irons</li>
            <li> Expensive, but can&#x27;t live without one!  I have had one for 10 years and it finally lost its bristles....otherwise it is still working.  I love these!</li>
            <li> I have used the IN Styler for years and finally had to order a new one.  I had noticed after two months that it would not heat up sometimes but then other times was perfect.  Now, it is smoking and burned my hair and for the price I paid, I am told I cannot return it.  You would think the manufacturer through Amazon would replace it no questions asked.  I would happily send the bad one back so they could see that when it is hot, it smokes.  Disappointed is an understatement.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for my type hair. My hair is usually frizzy &amp; unmanageable. So I got this so I didn&#x27;t have to use blowdryer &amp; straightener but this product made my hair very dry and smell burnt all day long.</li>
            <li> I have fine, curly hair and it is amazing on my hair.</li>
            <li> A My wife was delighted</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this product. Even on it&#x27;s highest settings it didn&#x27;t work well on my very curly hair. It didn&#x27;t stay hot for very long at all.</li>
            <li> I am AA with mixture of 4B/3C fine low density texlaxed hair. I really give this 3.5 stars...the first time I used it didn&#x27;t work out so well...came out pretty puffy and reverted quickly, but I am getting the hang of it now as the second time it came out much better. There is a learning curve to using it. It works better for me with the brush part facing up.</li>
            <li> Very good package. I&#x27;m happy with the product and is excellent. The fully recommend.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, works great! Love it, great purchase and a hair styling must-have!</li>
            <li> Over priced curling iron is all this is.  Really nothing special, and takes a bit of practice to use and not get it caught in your hair.  Can&#x27;t say anything really outstanding as the product claims.</li>
            <li> Great styler - gives hair volume</li>
            <li> This really smooths my naturally curly hair well.  The silver roller gets very hot.  Don&#x27;t let it touch your face or neck.  I use this after blow drying my hair to smooth the coarse hair and turn the ends under.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and an absolute life saver! My whole life I have struggled with limp and flat hair.  The InStyler has completely changed that.  When I use it to straighten or curl it adds so much body, volume and life to my hair.  It leaves my hair feeling sooooo soft too!  It really does the trick quickly and takes care of my frizz and fly aways.  I would definitely recommend this product to a friend. It has saved my hair!!</li>
            <li> works great hard to get the hang of when using</li>
            <li> love themthink i am going to order another pair.</li>
            <li> My coworker has been raving about this hot iron so I thought I would try it. Found it on sale at Ulta so I couldn&#x27;t refuse the price! I grew up with several hair professionals in my family so having been used to my routine of blow drying my hair straight and then using a 450 degree hair straightener in one hand and a brush in the other to tame my very course, long, thick wavy hair, I was skeptical about this max 410 degree iron.  Size and weight didn&#x27;t bother because I was used to using several tools at once. If anything, I thought it felt light and materials a little cheap. And from reading the other reviews, my hand only accidentally hit the power button once out of daily use in last two weeks so that wasn&#x27;t an issue either.    At first I thought I&#x27;d hate it because it wasn&#x27;t straightening or making it less frizzy, but after a few minutes of figuring out the rotation, it worked great!!! Personally, I found using my left hand made it easier considering the rotation. Made my hair shiny and frizz free with way less product than a straightening iron. Didn&#x27;t burn my hair and took same amount of time to straighten my whole head as a regular straightener (30 minutes with my hair being air dried, super wavy and frizzy) And my hair is longer than mid back so I don&#x27;t know what happened to those reviewers that took over an hour.  Haven&#x27;t tried curling but straightening and flipping works for sure! Style stayed the same all day in my non humid city. Didn&#x27;t work too well on bangs for me but I like to blow dry that anyways.</li>
            <li> Excellent item no problem until now my wife love it.</li>
            <li> This was an early birthday present for myself this year.  I&#x27;m so glad I bought this.  I&#x27;ve been ads for it for a while and thought it looked great.  I was right.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these 9 years ago from an infomercial and it was one of the best purchases I ever made. I have long hair and the InStyler is so easy to use and I get my hair done really fast. I HIGHLY recommend this product. Mine broke (after 9 years of daily use) and I had to buy a replacement one, I can&#x27;t live without my InStyler!!</li>
            <li> Yes it does the job fast. I didn&#x27;t have any problem with it.&lt;br /&gt;I should have ordered faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy make my life easier w/ InStyler.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> The instyler is amazing i have long thick slightly curly hair and when i want a nice sleek look the instyler is ready to go i can take a shower and do my hair in less time i got this as a gift and i bought my best friend one its amazing a must buy</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, decent priced item</li>
            <li> Doesnt work likeI expected. Also even with the guard on I burned the front of my forehead tonight. Thanks for the scare!</li>
            <li> First let me say that I have coarse/curly hair. It usually takes to heat very well and had no problem curling. I think that this product leaves the hair very silky and sleek however it is VERY. Hard to reach and straighten the roots. If you have coarse/curly hair like me you know that getting the roots is EXTREMELY. Important or else you will be left with puffy roots and straight ends. That is how the in styler lefty hair. I also found it was hard to get the shape I wanted at the ends of my hair. It took a lot of work to get my ends to curl under. After quite a few swipes and manipulation it finally got to my desired shape. I thought this product would minimize the time of doing my hair but it took me much longer. Not only that but I had to use my flat iron to contact my roots in order to have a complete look. I think this Product is excellent for people with more naturally straight/wavy/ fine hair as it would be easier to use and less of a hassle.</li>
            <li> This amazing hair product achieves the most stunningly stylish results! And it&#x27;s so easy to use. I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> Love my Instyler! Was so glade to fine it at a little cheaper price.</li>
            <li> Ok... So i bought an instyler.I thought wow it&#x27;s not to take as long for getting ready in the Morning.it was great until 4-5 months later , it just abruptly stopped in the middle of straightening my hair. I was like really I spent my money on this then I bought a new one going maybe my hair was tangled in that spot. I remembered to comb my hair every time before I straighten it and I did. then it broke again I researched more about it and i was not the only one. tons of others have the same issue because of what they used to make it the cheapest thing ever. if you plan on getting this be warned you&#x27;re wasting your money.</li>
            <li> This is an OK product. Not sure is it worth it 100$ or 80$( sale price). I think it can get frizz out of very thick, frizz prone hair. My hair naturally is very frizzy and curly. Not kinky curls just medium sized curls. I also did Brazilian blowout treatment so when I used InStyler my hair was sort of wavy, and still there is some frizz, but much less than usually.&lt;br /&gt;here are few things I first noticed about it:&lt;br /&gt;positives:&lt;br /&gt;-gets good curls, frizz free&lt;br /&gt;-learning curve is somewhat shorter compared to similar products, aka barrel type rotating and spin brushes&lt;br /&gt;-you get nice pad to set your insyler on, no worry about damaging counter&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;-somewhat time consuming&lt;br /&gt;-hairstyle does not last more than 2 days&lt;br /&gt;-hair gets very greasy after only few days, gets more humidity prone and I generally have to resort to washing it and that leads to styling all over&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I ended up returning it. I am not the person who washes hair every day. My hair is over 30 inches long, I get expensive brazilian blowout done and washing often will wash out the treatment. Also my hair is very dry, so more washing is a big no.  If you like washing your hair often, this might be good product. If not you might want to look into something else. It all depends how you hair responds to this. My hair did not respond well. It oversealed the cuticle and that leads to dirty look and greasy hair. Your hair might respond differently.</li>
            <li> My first one lasted five years ....as soon as the hinge stopped closely smoothly, I ordered another.  This is an essential tool for second day hair when my natural wave starts coming back in odd places!</li>
