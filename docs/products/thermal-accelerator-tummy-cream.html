            <li>I will continue to use this product being that I have 3 more inches to go.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s true that when something seems too good to be true, it probably isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have a smell and rubs in easily.</li>
            <li>I am not pointing fingers, but SOMEONE has made a lot of money by charging MORE  than what this cream is worth.  </li>
            <li>works fantastic tumach is visably flater</li>
            <li>It is super easy.  </li>
            <li>after only 3 uses of the belt, my husband asked if I found a new exercise because I was looking great!  </li>
            <li>This came in a form of lotion as compared to that which  came with the original purchase.  </li>
            <li>I thought the original cream was working, that&#x27;s why I came to purchase just the cream but am dissapointed</li>
            <li>Had the original &amp;#34;Thermal</li>
            <li>The original one was thicker.</li>
            <li>a day.the accelerator cream is not greasy, and the second application I use a wrap to make it more effective.</li>
            <li>So far this tube isn&#x27;t as effective.</li>
            <li>Everyone who wants to loss inches easy.</li>
            <li>This really works!!  </li>
            <li>AND OUT OF A LOT TIME MONEY AND VERY DISSAPOINTMENT GIVIONIASMITH!!</li>
            <li>I would also like to know if fthis is the real cream that goes with the tummy tuck belt for the cream doesn&#x27;t say accelerator cream, like the original one did.</li>
            <li>It helps burn tummy fat even faster when you eat right and exercise.</li>
            <li>Did not work like the first order with wrap.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>This cream does work when you consistently follow the directions.  </li>
            <li>Lost 1 1/2  inches within the first week.  </li>
            <li>This is not my first time trying Thermal Accelerator Tummy Cream W</li>
            <li>u will get better results if exercising and the proper Diet.</li>
            <li>The Tummy Tuck cream does exactly what it said it would do.  </li>
            <li>After many e-mails in attempting to tell Kredit Management they have been OVERCHARGING for this cream, the price has finally,  finally CHANGED from $49.95 to $28.49.  </li>
            <li>And consumers HAVE been paying the HIGHER $49.95.  </li>
            <li>I followed their directions exactly for a month, and I saw no change.  </li>
            <li>This lotion really does work!</li>
            <li>I have exercised but I have lost 2 inches in first week</li>
            <li>Love the Tummy Tuck cream, it helps burn off fat especially if used when exercising.</li>
            <li>this cream is a waste of good money...</li>
            <li>When I first started I used the cream twice a day and had a sensible diet and really reduced my waist.</li>
            <li>First, the entire tube is filled with clunks of the product.</li>
            <li>The cream was very lumpy.</li>
            <li>Really like this product think it has helped remove some stubborn fat in belly area.</li>
            <li>If you want results real results try belly burner it does work..</li>
            <li>I have used this product for a while can&#x27;t really tell if it is working thanks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the accelerator along with the tummy waist slimmer for 2 yrs and the duo  works very well.  </li>
            <li>This I would really recommend cuz</li>
            <li>it really seems to work.</li>
            <li>My name is Sari Mitchell and I am very disturbed by what I received when I ordered the accelerator cream from you.  </li>
            <li>my mom really likes it</li>
            <li>THIS STUFF REALLY WORKS WITH THE TUMMY TUCK BELT.</li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>I did, and let me tell you it does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>Works with the tummy tuck belt the same as the original supply</li>
            <li>and this one is full of clumps, i lost the receipt to the second on and couldn&#x27;t return it</li>
            <li>thank you for having such cool stuff..</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this cream</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;ll give it a few more  months.  </li>
            <li>It pays for consumers to speak loud and clear!!!</li>
            <li>No big change right away.</li>
            <li>I just needed a new tube of the tummy cream because I ran out.</li>
            <li>I see different; but I guess i expected more.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t the same cream that I bought the first time.</li>
            <li>This has served my expectations completely.</li>
            <li>But those of us with fat stomachs already have the SOFT stomach we don&#x27;t need a cream.</li>
            <li>by vasoline cream if you want a soft stomach.</li>
            <li>Got my 2 bottles of the thermal cream and its old have chunks in it</li>
            <li>SO FAR</li>
            <li>ALL SO FAR WEN WILL</li>
            <li>So far I like it</li>
            <li>but it is too early to tell if it has the desired result for me.</li>
            <li>product was so old it would not come out of the tube.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time in 60 years on this earth I can actually say I MIGHT have a flat tummy someday!</li>
            <li>I am severely disabled and I don&#x27;t have that kind of money to waste.</li>
            <li>This works in much the same way as you doing percussion on the back of a person with lung fluid buildup.</li>
            <li>The only thing I noticed was it made my skin belly soft.</li>
            <li>I have ordered my 2nd tube and will need to go down to the next sized belt soon ;-)</li>
            <li>the accelerator cream took nearly a month to arrive and when it did it was all dry inside the tube, couldn&#x27;t be used and had to be thrown away.</li>
            <li>Since I have a very hard time not saying no to holiday goodies, the cream seems to allow me to still fit in my current pants.  </li>

            <li> Since I have a very hard time not saying no to holiday goodies, the cream seems to allow me to still fit in my current pants.  </li>
            <li> Because when I started to use that cream, I started slowly going right back to where I started.  </li>
            <li> You can really see the results regardless how small</li>
            <li> I lost 2 and a half inches so far.  </li>
            <li> It was a little soft.</li>
            <li> It works as long as you continue to put it on twice a day .</li>
            <li> It does what it says it will do as long as you follow the directions.</li>
            <li> Put it on and wait for to dry then put on the belly thing.  </li>
            <li> This cream is a total waste of your money the cream don&#x27;t work and the belt make your tummy look bigger.</li>
            <li> Not very  much results.</li>
            <li> every thing as expected  no compaint</li>
            <li> Works as expected.  </li>
            <li> Small red patches appeared on my stomach.  </li>
            <li> The other cream was a lot thicker.</li>
            <li> That is my only complaint.</li>
            <li> You can actually feel as it becomes less hard.</li>
            <li> negative comment is that its texture is not smooth when applied to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;There are some solid particles that make the even spreading of the product somehow</li>
            <li> These previous reviews are LIES...</li>
            <li> It was a little lumpy....</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Will not be using this firm again, the product is not the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roberta</li>
            <li> Very little if any</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what else to say</li>
            <li> .. waste of my money!</li>
            <li> it reduced those ugly pouches us older ladies get.</li>
            <li> Sorry my review is secondhand.</li>
            <li> Not good.  </li>
            <li> defective dried up unable to use</li>
            <li> I  exercise too, but have always exercised, and never experienced results like this.</li>
            <li> After using this product I developed a terrible itching.  </li>

            <li> This is the third tube I&#x27;ve bought, the last one  and this one is full of clumps, i lost the receipt to the second on and couldn&#x27;t return it so what do I do with this one.</li>
            <li> It works. I&#x27;m not sure what else to say but if you follow the directions it does reduce your tummy.  It is super easy.  I lost 2 and a half inches so far.  I also found that if I put the cream on the upper part of my buttocks it reduced those ugly pouches us older ladies get.</li>
            <li> It works better when I&#x27;m sleep I put the cream on and the belt I also drink a 16oz of waters. I&#x27;ll give it a five</li>
            <li> Like the smell, only being using a week</li>
            <li> My husband uses the tummy tuck cream and loves it.</li>
            <li> unhappy with the tummy tuck system. Did not meet my expectations. Would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> The cream was very lumpy.</li>
            <li> Did not work like the first order with wrap.</li>
            <li> Really like this product think it has helped remove some stubborn fat in belly area. Doesn&#x27;t have a smell and rubs in easily.</li>
            <li> I love it wish it would work faster though.</li>
            <li> I need to order it again.</li>
            <li> every thing as expected  no compaint</li>
            <li> Great product and will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Did the name change to tummy cream? This came in a form of lotion as compared to that which  came with the original purchase.  I thought the original cream was working, that&#x27;s why I came to purchase just the cream but am dissapointed</li>
            <li> Did not work a lie.i don&#x27;t recommend this product do not buy please!!!! If you want results real results try belly burner it does work..</li>
            <li> I see different; but I guess i expected more.</li>
            <li> Item is wonderful! I have been using it 2 months now and my stomach has trimmed downed tremendously!!! It is great!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a while can&#x27;t really tell if it is working thanks</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> This is the Best cream ever!  Have lost 8 inches of body in 12 weeks! Everyone who wants to loss inches easy. Get the Tummy Tuck System and cream!</li>
            <li> Not good.  Didn&#x27;t see any results.</li>
            <li> it is OK.  No big change right away.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.  I did find that I could not use the cream as often as recommended.  I use the cream once a day.  It does seem to keep my waist from expanding.  So, it seems to be working.  Since I have a very hard time not saying no to holiday goodies, the cream seems to allow me to still fit in my current pants.  When I first started I used the cream twice a day and had a sensible diet and really reduced my waist.</li>
            <li> This cream does work when you consistently follow the directions.  It helps burn tummy fat even faster when you eat right and exercise.</li>
            <li> Thought I would get better results</li>
            <li> This really works!!  Lost 1 1/2  inches within the first week.  I  exercise too, but have always exercised, and never experienced results like this.</li>
            <li> not woking at all and was so expensive waist of money i used it as directed 2 times a day</li>
            <li> This is not my first time trying Thermal Accelerator Tummy Cream W the Waist band.cu u will get better results if exercising and the proper Diet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good makes your tummy feel good</li>
            <li> I have used, but infrequently.  I have to say when done per the instruction, with the belt, it does seem to work.  I have use it more often.</li>
            <li> This has served my expectations completely. Iwanted something different and worked as well. thank you for having such cool stuff..</li>
            <li> Good product. Works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the accelerator along with the tummy waist slimmer for 2 yrs and the duo  works very well.  I just needed a new tube of the tummy cream because I ran out.</li>
            <li> It works as long as you continue to put it on twice a day . I seen a difference after second tube. I love it !!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just wondering if this cream would also work on the thigh area?</li>
            <li> After using this product I developed a terrible itching.  Small red patches appeared on my stomach.  I stopped using it and put anti-itching meds on the area for several days.  The spots finally went away as did the itching</li>
            <li> The cream is very good as expected.&lt;br /&gt;The negative comment is that its texture is not smooth when applied to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;There are some solid particles that make the even spreading of the product somehow difficult.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;Leda Polti</li>
            <li> Had the original &amp;#34;Thermal Accelerator Tummy Cream&amp;#34; when the Tummy Tuck Belt first came out, and it worked great!!  I workout all the time, but after only 3 uses of the belt, my husband asked if I found a new exercise because I was looking great!  Well once my cream was almost gone, I ordered more.  I got &amp;#34;Tummy Cream&amp;#34;.  When I called the company, they said they had no idea what that Tummy Cream was, and said they&#x27;d re-send the &amp;#34;Thermal Accelerator Cream&amp;#34;.  After 2 more wrong shipments of &amp;#34;Tummy Cream&amp;#34;, I asked to talk to a manager, who then said it was the same as their Thermal Accelerator Cream, they just &amp;#34;renamed it&amp;#34;...she said it was the same thing...even with the same ingredients....IT&#x27;S NOT!!  It may have the same ingredients listed, but it&#x27;s in different amounts!  Because when I started to use that cream, I started slowly going right back to where I started.  Their &amp;#34;New&amp;#34; cream DOES NOT WORK!!</li>
            <li> Why isn&#x27;t Thermal Accelerator on the tube I bought? This isn&#x27;t the same cream that I bought the first time. The other cream was a lot thicker. I&#x27;m very disappointed....</li>
            <li> This I would really recommend cuz it does work but make sure you buy this one and not the imitated ones.</li>
            <li> This is the first time in 60 years on this earth I can actually say I MIGHT have a flat tummy someday! This cream works by softening the fat layer beneath the skin. You can actually feel as it becomes less hard. I augment the tummy toning cream and belt by vigorously slapping the areas I want to dislodge the fat from. This works in much the same way as you doing percussion on the back of a person with lung fluid buildup. I have ordered my 2nd tube and will need to go down to the next sized belt soon ;-)</li>
            <li> The Tummy Tuck cream does exactly what it said it would do.  My husband can even see a difference.</li>
            <li> The thermal Accelerator Tummy Cream was as pictured. Having used it before, I was so glad to buy it again!</li>
            <li> This cream is a total waste of your money the cream don&#x27;t work and the belt make your tummy look bigger. you people need to stop taking away people money</li>
            <li> This tube did not say  &amp;#34;Thermal Accelerator&amp;#34; like the advertised tube. The one I got Good resultes had &amp;#34;T. A.&amp;#34; writen on it. So far this tube isn&#x27;t as effective. I guess I&#x27;ll give it a few more  months.  BJO</li>
            <li> I use the stuff and I can not explain how it works.  Put it on and wait for to dry then put on the belly thing.  I use both and I have noticed the weight loss in about 3 weeks.  Try this one.</li>
            <li> three tubes did nothing .wore as directed</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see a difference at all. Used it along with my workout routine, saw no difference.</li>
            <li> it really seems to work. I bought to replace what came with the belt.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t do what said it dose</li>
            <li> Seems to be working well for me.</li>
            <li> My name is Sari Mitchell and I am very disturbed by what I received when I ordered the accelerator cream from you.  I had recently ordered your tummy cream however, there are 2 problems.  First, the entire tube is filled with clunks of the product. It comes out in clusters not cream. This is horrible for all I get are clumps of the stuff on me and it drops everywhere. I would also like to know if fthis is the real cream that goes with the tummy tuck belt for the cream doesn&#x27;t say accelerator cream, like the original one did. Is this a totally different product or a knock off Please get back to me at knickknackshack2@yahoo.com (786) 308-0540 Please write me or call and hopefully we can work this out. I am severely disabled and I don&#x27;t have that kind of money to waste. Please help me. I need this product and will be purchasing</li>
            <li> JUST GOT SO HOPE IT WORKS FOR ME</li>
            <li> It was a little soft. The original one was thicker.</li>
            <li> After many e-mails in attempting to tell Kredit Management they have been OVERCHARGING for this cream, the price has finally,  finally CHANGED from $49.95 to $28.49.  The price on the website on the back of the tube is $24.99.  Kredit Management has been charging $49.95 for &amp;#34;Tummy-Cream&amp;#34; by the same company.  I am happy that consumers DO have a voice and something positive happens from our efforts.  I am not pointing fingers, but SOMEONE has made a lot of money by charging MORE  than what this cream is worth.  And consumers HAVE been paying the HIGHER $49.95.  I can&#x27;t give credit to Amazon or Kredit Management for making the correction, but consumers of this product should feel they are NOW getting a FAIR price!  It pays for consumers to speak loud and clear!!!</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money.  I followed their directions exactly for a month, and I saw no change.  I guess it&#x27;s true that when something seems too good to be true, it probably isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Not very  much results. Very little if any</li>
            <li> This lotion really does work! I sweat every time I use it. I prefer using it without the waist band. I feel that it works the best is when you are working out. you sweat more equals burning more weight!</li>
            <li> Works as expected.  You can really see the results regardless how small</li>
            <li> my mom really likes it</li>
            <li> I could not tell if the cream is working or not</li>
            <li> the accelerator cream took nearly a month to arrive and when it did it was all dry inside the tube, couldn&#x27;t be used and had to be thrown away.</li>
            <li> It was a little lumpy....but I&#x27;m using it anyway.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE! THIS STUFF REALLY WORKS WITH THE TUMMY TUCK BELT. I WEAR IT EVERY NIGHT, DO MY STOMACH EXERCISES, AND HAVE A WAIST! I AM EVEN GETTING ABS THAT CAN BE SEEN!</li>
            <li> I have only been using the product for about a week and I am already noticing results. I thought it would heat up or something, but it doesn&#x27;t. You dont even have to apply alot.</li>
            <li> I applied the cream without the wrap because the wrap rolls up on me. I like this cream and I will purchase more of this product,[[ASIN:B008M795PE Thermal Accelerator Tummy Cream]] simply put THIS WORKS!!! I have lost 4 inches around my waist in just one month.</li>
            <li> This tube did not do what it&#x27;s supposed to do at all. I think it&#x27;s a scam. It did nothing at all, it was just like putting on regular body lotion. Very dissatisfied. I won&#x27;t use it, it&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> i have found that i have lost 1 inch in my waist. i use this with the tummy tuck belt.</li>
            <li> Love this product and found the seller to be thoughtful and honest. Will purchase from her again.</li>
            <li> My son bought two tubes of this cream, He moved out with out using or even opening the box it came in. I decided to read up on it, and use it myself...I did, and let me tell you it does absolutely nothing. Zero, ziltch...It does how ever work like any over the counter hand cream to soften. But those of us with fat stomachs already have the SOFT stomach we don&#x27;t need a cream. It is a big shame to get peoples hopes up and take their money for nothing....IT DOES NOT WORK. by vasoline cream if you want a soft stomach.</li>
            <li> Got my 2 bottles of the thermal cream and its old have chunks in it white clumps come out.  Won&#x27;t order it again.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a change I stop using the product because I didn&#x27;t feel the tingling sensation that others was tlkin about.</li>
            <li> The cream is great. It does what it says it will do as long as you follow the directions. The cream is Too Expensive buying it alone. That is my only complaint.</li>
            <li> These previous reviews are LIES...this cream is a waste of good money...You are better off wearing a griddle than this stuff...</li>
            <li> defective dried up unable to use</li>
            <li> shipped on time, got it on time. used it for about a week before this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the cream does what its suppose to do which is increase the heat where you apply it on your belly in order to lose weight or inches. for me my goal was to lose the inches of belly fat. tried this product for a week and about an inch has dissapeared so it is working. I am planning to continue to use this product for awhile to lose more inches.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS CREAM 2 GO ALONG WITH MY TUMMY TUCK GARMENT IT IS SUPPOSE 2 WORK WITH THE CREAM AND USED TWICE A DAY 4 10 MINUETS SO FAR I HAVE USED IT 4 2 MONTHS AND A 2 MONTH SUPPLY OF THIS CREAM AN ADDITIONAL 30.00 AND NO RESULTS @ ALL SO FAR WEN WILL I C RESULTS I WAS 44 INCHES N WAISTE WHEN I STATED I AM 46INCHES N  WAISTE NOW IS THERE A MONEY BACK GUARANTEE BACK SOMEWHERE PLEASE LET ME KNOW I HAVE ALSO CHANGED MY DIET AND EXERCISE MORE NO RESULTS I WILL GIVE IT A ONE MORE MONTH SUPLY MAYBE IF S T I L L NO NO NO NO NO  RESULTS IM OUT AND OUT OF A LOT TIME MONEY AND VERY DISSAPOINTMENT GIVIONIASMITH!!</li>
            <li> The cream didnt work i even worked out 4 days out the week for a month while using it and still no results</li>
            <li> had it for three month and no change</li>
            <li> So far I like it but it is too early to tell if it has the desired result for me.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t think it worked for me .. waste of my money!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister whom uses it continually and swears by it. So I gave it 5 stars but I have never personally used it. Sorry my review is secondhand.</li>
            <li> A great product.i use it twice a day.the accelerator cream is not greasy, and the second application I use a wrap to make it more effective.</li>
            <li> Works with the tummy tuck belt the same as the original supply and they do the job I lost several inches off my stomach and abdomen just by following directions.</li>
            <li> I have exercised but I have lost 2 inches in first week</li>
            <li> works fantastic tumach is visably flater</li>
            <li> I love my tummy tuck system it is the only thing that has worked for me and work it did</li>
            <li> The product here is way overprices.  Go to the Tummy Tuck site and get it for $29.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tthe product was so old it would not come out of the tube.  I bought it in Feb as a back up to the tube that came with the belt so it was five months until I opened it.  Will not be using this firm again, the product is not the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roberta</li>
            <li> Since using the Thermal Accelerator Tummy Cream I lost a total of 2 inches around my tummy in 2 months without changing my eating and exercise routine. I AM VERY HAPPY. I will continue to use this product being that I have 3 more inches to go.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this cream no go, I was told you would feel the burn, no go. The only thing I noticed was it made my skin belly soft.</li>
            <li> Love the Tummy Tuck cream, it helps burn off fat especially if used when exercising.</li>
