            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have used EL products, and this one did not seem authentic.</li>
            <li>and I love it partibular during the winter</li>
            <li>Super Super Super!!!  </li>
            <li>Wonderful, very moisturizing and not heavy at all.</li>
            <li>Amazing thank you very helpful!</li>
            <li>Definitely going to order more soon!!</li>
            <li>Small jar - not the best value I think.  </li>
            <li>top of that, the price is super reasonable.</li>
            <li>While using Estee Lauder Daywear my skin completely cleared up in addition to having a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>Naturally, I searched out more of this when I finished the 15ml (.5 oz) bottle.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>EL usually feels great on the skin, this just gave me breakouts.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin so smooth and soft!</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>first tried it when a friend gave me a sample</li>
            <li>I hope nobody use these creme and they are really fresh and new...</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>so much so that I can not use cleansers or go without moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast delivered.</li>
            <li>It makes skin litly pink (gives healthy look).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad product, but definitely wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite face moisturizer, and I typically don&#x27;t like face moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Normally this runs upwards of $40, which I can not afford.</li>
            <li>They make my skin soft.</li>
            <li>My skin is really sensitive to break out--</li>
            <li>Makes your skin soft and</li>
            <li>The jar was much smaller then I expected product was just okay, not enough to tell he difference</li>
            <li>Slightly greasy when you first put it on thanks to the SPF.</li>
            <li>I recently bought some of this in a sample size elsewhere online (and paid very little), so this is a tad overpriced to me, but still worth it.</li>

            <li> love this daycream. Just what I was looking for.!!</li>
            <li> I always wear Estée Lauder skin creams.  They make my skin soft.</li>
            <li> Excelent cream daywear..</li>
            <li> A very small quantity in each jar. Not a good value for the money you pay.</li>

            <li> I love this product it changed my skin!!!! It smells divine too!!!!</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery. I received it on next day after I did my order. Excellent service and price!! I have only one concern- both cremes did not have boxes, just only had a printed sticker &amp;#34;New&amp;#34; from owner, put by hands. When I bought  this size at Macys, it was covered with a green Estée Lauder box. I hope nobody use these creme and they are really fresh and new...</li>
            <li> great product will buy it again when the price is right</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s fast delivered. Good product. I like it very much. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great , I love this product...</li>
            <li> The cream is truly awesome!. It makes skin litly pink (gives healthy look). Buy it and you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Slightly greasy when you first put it on thanks to the SPF. But it&#x27;s worth it. I use the laminating cream under it and they look great together.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive/combinztion skin. The creme works beautifully.</li>
            <li> This is a great product but the vendor did NOT send the correct amount.  I opened it today and found it to be incorrect. I do not know if it is too late to return.  I was to receive 15cc, paid for that amount but received .5.</li>
            <li> Good product for the day.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin soft and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;I first tried it when a friend gave me a sample then couldn&#x27;t resist continuing using it.&lt;br /&gt;On top of that, the price is super reasonable.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this and is looking to get a larger container when this one is finished, will buy again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think anyone should buy estee lauder products from Amazon (I was dumb enough to buy). I have used EL products, and this one did not seem authentic. EL usually feels great on the skin, this just gave me breakouts. Maybe it is just me, but just giving a warning.</li>

            <li> I always looking for this brand and I love it partibular during the winter the skin need protection this is the best</li>
            <li> The jar was much smaller then I expected product was just okay, not enough to tell he difference it would make to my skin</li>
            <li> Wife like this product a lot</li>
            <li> Awesome. Can&#x27;t go wrong with Estée.</li>
            <li> Great protection and this is the only moisturizer that I use...perfect for traveling....</li>
            <li> My favorite face cream!:)</li>
            <li> This is the greatest.  i will probably use this forever.  Super Super Super!!!  This gives you such a glow and your face feel like it is breathing.  Only need a dime size on each cheek.</li>
            <li> Amazing thank you very helpful! Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Renee (Rivki) Silverberg&lt;br /&gt;Author of Understanding Children and Families with Autism Spectrum Disorders&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
