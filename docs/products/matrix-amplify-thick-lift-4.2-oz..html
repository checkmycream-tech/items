            <li>Does a great job on my very fine hair!</li>
            <li>This product amps up my hair, so that it looks good through most water and weather conditions.  </li>
            <li>Great Communication/ Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>This product came with packing tape around the top, not manufacturer&#x27;s seal.  </li>
            <li>Marshall&#x27;s seems to be clearing them out though for 5 dollars and contain more liquid than the one I bought from amazon.</li>
            <li>This was ok</li>
            <li>I love this product and am willing to pay more rather than risk a product that may have been tampered with.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this for fine hair</li>
            <li>My daughter, a hair stylist, gave me a bottle of this to use for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair dresser no longer offers it and am delighted I can purchase it from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it particularly for more fullness!</li>
            <li>but I really thought this product wasn&#x27;t anything special.  </li>
            <li>i will continue to buy Pantene gel as it is less than 1/2 the price and does a good volumizing job</li>
            <li>great product for volume, hard to find</li>
            <li>still on the first bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Works great applied to wet hair, comb through and blow dry - noticed immediate improvement.</li>
            <li>Both bottles were empty by 1 to 1.5 inches from the top.  </li>
            <li>It really worked.  </li>
            <li>I hope the next time I have to order you still have this product available.</li>
            <li>I really like this volumizing liquid.</li>
            <li>It takes the least amount to do a good job.</li>
            <li>Luckily I found it on Amazon and ordered several bottles.</li>
            <li>It is not heavy or greasy, and it doesn&#x27;t take much to style my hair.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, I noticed there was some empty space near the top of the bottle, more than what I usually find in stores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and loved it for my fine thin limp hair.</li>
            <li>I use it daily and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This product works very well on my fine thin hair.</li>
            <li>Its ok, I am not too crazy about it though since I don&#x27;t see much of the promised results.</li>

            <li> I love this styling gel because although it&#x27;s very thick, you only need to use very little to get the lasting affect.</li>
            <li> ---hair is moderately volumized but dull; does not make it very voluminous or shiney or lustrous.</li>
            <li> I compared to a store bought one (Marshall&#x27;s) and noticed about 3/4 of empty space difference.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> While traveling, my hair is often exposed to different water conditions, even though it is used to hard water.  </li>
            <li> Volume added without weighing hair down.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s quite a bit of missing liquid.</li>
            <li> but I did not think it lifted the roots well and made my hair feel to heavy , unclean feeling.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I wanted to make my hair not as stiff as Redken Thickening Lotion</li>
            <li> I have used it for a long time, unfortunate</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores now.</li>
            <li> plus it doesn&#x27;t dull my hair!</li>
            <li> Not happy with on line product.</li>
            <li> Sorry, I don&#x27;t have a scale to measure the difference in ounces yet, but something is off here.</li>

            <li> Works well. Love this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Increases volume incredibly and smells amazing...not fruity!</li>
            <li> great product. still on the first bottle. works great. can not even tell it&#x27;s in your hair.</li>
            <li> Its ok, I am not too crazy about it though since I don&#x27;t see much of the promised results.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I wanted to make my hair not as stiff as Redken Thickening Lotion but I really thought this product wasn&#x27;t anything special.  This seller is excellent-highly recommend/Great Communication/ Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and loved it for my fine thin limp hair. However, seems like this product doesn&#x27;t do as well now as when I started using it. Wonder if it hasn&#x27;t been replaced with something else.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with my purchase.  I saved quite a bit of money shopping here on line.  I will purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> While traveling, my hair is often exposed to different water conditions, even though it is used to hard water.  This product amps up my hair, so that it looks good through most water and weather conditions.  It is not heavy or greasy, and it doesn&#x27;t take much to style my hair.</li>
            <li> This product came with packing tape around the top, not manufacturer&#x27;s seal.  Both bottles were empty by 1 to 1.5 inches from the top.  Will definitely buy from the manufacturer next time.  I love this product and am willing to pay more rather than risk a product that may have been tampered with.  Will not use this seller again.</li>
            <li> An excellent product. You only need a small amount. Makes the hair shine too.</li>
            <li> great product for volume, hard to find</li>
            <li> I like the way it makes my hair fuller and easier to style. I would recommend this for fine hair</li>
            <li> My daughter, a hair stylist, gave me a bottle of this to use for my fine hair.  It really worked.  When I wanted to purchase another bottle, I could find it nowhere. After researching, I found out that Matrix no longer manufactures this and has no substitute for it.  Luckily I found it on Amazon and ordered several bottles.</li>
            <li> Bought this on line  because it has been discontinued in stores.  Didn&#x27;t get the same results. Not happy with on line product.</li>
            <li> This product works very well on my fine thin hair. I have used it for a long time, unfortunate it is now a discontinued product. That is why when I found it at Aamazon I ordered 10 bottles. I hope the next time I have to order you still have this product available. Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great. HOWEVER, I noticed there was some empty space near the top of the bottle, more than what I usually find in stores. I compared to a store bought one (Marshall&#x27;s) and noticed about 3/4 of empty space difference. That&#x27;s quite a bit of missing liquid. Sorry, I don&#x27;t have a scale to measure the difference in ounces yet, but something is off here. Or this may only be a problem with my individual order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, great product. Hard to find in stores now. Marshall&#x27;s seems to be clearing them out though for 5 dollars and contain more liquid than the one I bought from amazon.</li>
            <li> This was ok but I did not think it lifted the roots well and made my hair feel to heavy , unclean feeling.</li>
            <li> Does a great job on my very fine hair!</li>
            <li> I really like this volumizing liquid. It takes the least amount to do a good job. I&#x27;ve tried several and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> This is the best root lifter product I have ever found. My hair stays all day and holds the style I put in without any touch up during the day. I wish it would come in larger bottles as I go through it really fast as I use it everyday. I never have to worry about my &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; spot on the back of my head appearing because this product holds my hair up from the scalp ALL day!</li>
            <li> I love this styling gel because although it&#x27;s very thick, you only need to use very little to get the lasting affect. The salons are always changing their products and after searching all over town, someone suggested I check Amazon and there it was!!!  I order several bottles at once so I&#x27;ll never run out.</li>
            <li> Works great applied to wet hair, comb through and blow dry - noticed immediate improvement. Volume added without weighing hair down.</li>
            <li> Very good for putting volume in your hair.  I use it each time I wash my hair and it does increase the volume.  A very good product! I highly recommend it particularly for more fullness!</li>
            <li> not as great as i hoped---hair is moderately volumized but dull; does not make it very voluminous or shiney or lustrous. i will continue to buy Pantene gel as it is less than 1/2 the price and does a good volumizing job plus it doesn&#x27;t dull my hair!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and just now found it on Amazon.  My hair dresser no longer offers it and am delighted I can purchase it from Amazon.  It is a wonderful product that provides body and manageability to hair.  I use it daily and highly recommend it.</li>
