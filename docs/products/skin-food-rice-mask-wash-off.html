            <li>I have just tried this product and my skin already looks better!!</li>
            <li>AMAZING!</li>
            <li>It is great for hydrating the face and making it feel plump and bright.</li>
            <li>but it was pleasant to use &amp;</li>
            <li>My skin gets irritated very easily, but that was not an issue with this mask!</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s not like I ALWAYS eat rice for dinner, so this product is a good replacement.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got a sample from an ebay store and absolutely loved it; so I ordered 3 containers.</li>
            <li>The mask should still be good for up to three years after that date.</li>
            <li>It is a good product to take your blackheads out.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s good for what it is.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good on acne skins&lt;</li>
            <li>This mask feels very refreshing and cooling on my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Washing with rice and/or oatmeal water works wonders for my skin, so I completely love the idea of this product!</li>
            <li>I love this mask!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>

            <li>I love this mask!</li>
            <li>Like all of Skinfood&#x27;s products, it smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>I feel really amazing afterwards.</li>
            <li>This scrub is amazing.</li>
            <li>It is an amazing feeling when all of dirt and oily are flushed away from my skin by this rice mask.</li>
            <li>South korea in paticular has spectacular beauty products.</li>
            <li>I will probably repurchase as my skin is loving Skin Food.</li>
            <li>The texture is kind of like rice pudding but with fewer and finer &#x27;chunks&#x27;.</li>
            <li>The texture is nice too, but I wish it wasn&#x27;t scented.</li>
            <li>Love it for the price, great scent too :)</li>
            <li>I do it in the morning after the shower, and rinse it with warm water.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t a off-putting smell and the consistency is nice - not too grainy like I thought it might be.</li>
            <li>I really appreciated that this seller gave samples with my purchase, they were totally awesome!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do anything spectacular</li>
            <li>The product feels nice.</li>
            <li>Loving it.</li>
            <li>Packaging is good at keeping excess water out though- under the twist on top there is a lid that keeps moisture</li>
            <li>smell nice</li>
            <li>Clean very nice, no leftover make up on my towel .</li>
            <li>i am so happy this has gone mainstream, it is a super product and at $10.00 a steal.</li>
            <li>short, it&#x27;s a good mask -- just not the best!</li>
            <li>I would say it&#x27;s good for when you want a light cleansing mask.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best exfoliant I have ever used.</li>
            <li>great smell and very gentle</li>
            <li>The product&#x27;s smell is very light.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I purchased this.</li>
            <li>This mask smells really refreshing, it has a nice light scent.</li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>This famous product lives up to its reviews and description.</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s perfectly free!</li>
            <li>and yes more samples</li>
            <li>and I already love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wondering now if I can get better results from buying one that isn&#x27;t expired...</li>
            <li>It has a fresh light scent and the consistency is great.</li>
            <li>I gave 4 stars because I wish it was a tad bit more abrasive, but overall it&#x27;s an awesome product.</li>
            <li>I love this mask.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>and I love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>can purchase a better mask with this price.</li>
            <li>but im not fully sure..</li>
            <li>i need to test it out more.</li>
            <li>I love this products.</li>
            <li>I love the effectiveness of this.</li>
            <li>:) I don&#x27;t like the way that I have to massage my face.</li>
            <li>In fact, my skin looks better without makeup than it does with it.</li>
            <li>its&#x27;s refreshing  and whitening&lt;br /&gt;also</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad he uses this as well</li>
            <li>I really wanted to try out products from Skin Food since I&#x27;ve heard great things about this Korean brand.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, feels light and brightens and calms my skin.</li>
            <li>Seems more like a gimmick.</li>
            <li>will use this product often :)</li>
            <li>After i wash my face off with water, my skin immediately feels refreshed and smooth!</li>
            <li>Great product and very soft texture</li>
            <li>My skin was sooooooooooo smooth that my bf can&#x27;t stop touching and kissing me lol.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Made my skin feel soft and just happy.  </li>
            <li>This is a very mild mask.</li>
            <li>To me the smell is not distinctive or strong at all.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love it as much as I love the Black Sugar scrub by Skin Food, but its good!</li>
            <li>it just makes my skin soft and brighter for one day :P</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a temporary result, but it&#x27;s nice when you first use it</li>
            <li>It has fine rice-base scrub that doesn&#x27;t scratch your skin at all.</li>
            <li>I use it in the bath and massage on my face for about 10 minutes before rinsing - super relaxing!</li>
            <li>Whenever I could feel a pimple forming, I use this mask and the pimple quickly fades away!</li>
            <li>I love the mild smell of banana as well.</li>
            <li>This mask has a nice smell to it and you feel the rice particles, I love this mask you can keep it on your face for a while and your fave is soft and smooth when you take it off.</li>
            <li>this leaves your skin bright and clear after use.</li>
            <li>After reading all the rave reviews and seeing the attractive packaging and company philosophy, I purchased 5 masks without ever testing SkinFood products (rice, blk sesame, egg white and acai berry).</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft, hydrated and bright after using it.</li>
            <li>The number eleven expression lines that were beginning to become obvious have GREATLY diminished.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face smooth and I like the scent.</li>
            <li>You will have a soft and bright skin after you wash this stuff off.</li>
            <li>: Product is smooth- almost like a lotion-</li>
            <li>My skin is nice, and soft, and smooth after I use it, no flakes or dryness!</li>
            <li>It made my complexion more fair, and overall a smoother face.</li>
            <li>Immediately after using it, my skin is nice, soft, clean, and brightened!</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin smooth and clean &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>It is worth the cost!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so excited to try it</li>
            <li>This gentle exfoliating scrub/mask is suitable for using often.</li>
            <li>Still, definitely worth buying as a gentle exfoliator and the smell is nice.</li>
            <li>I use a clean butter knife to take it out of the tub.</li>
            <li>It makes my skill feel super smooth</li>
            <li>then i rinse it with lukewarm water and sealed it with your favorite face cream and your face will be soft :)</li>
            <li>my skin feels super clean, smooth and shinny</li>
            <li>Really mild, light scent, and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing unique or special about this mask that would justify its price.</li>
            <li>This product make my face nice and very soft.</li>
            <li>Plus, I love the gentle exfoliation you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gentle exfoliation then washes off to leave skin feeling comfortable and hydrated!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also incredibly moisturizing without being too heavy.</li>
            <li>this combo mask-scrub is a pleasure to use, non-gritty and mild.</li>
            <li>results are great : my skin is soft, moist, and all the redness I had since I have a sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The only true good aspect about this mask is it feels very gentle to the skin and is probably suitable for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Skinfood is a great brand, will probably try out some of their other products as well!</li>
            <li>Does exactly what its&#x27; supposed to do!</li>
            <li>This is my first time using Skin Food products and I am hooked!</li>
            <li>Do you want a super soft and smooth face???&lt;br /&gt;Buy it!</li>
            <li>Skin food is a great line, I love the way my skin feels after this facial and the easy with little time.</li>
            <li>Brightens and exfoliates, skin always looks so fresh after this mask.</li>
            <li>I saw more results from cheap drugstore buys (even if short lived) than these.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t honestly say that it helps even out skin tone, but it definitely helps with breakouts.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use many face masks, but this makes my skin feel really soft after using it.</li>
            <li>face is getting more clear as she wished to be</li>
            <li>Nice moisturizing facial mask</li>
            <li>I will probably be repurchasing this, because I just love its texture so much, but not from this particular seller.</li>
            <li>A bit smaller than I had expected but well worth it!!!! :)</li>
            <li>Great on those days you just need a little pick me up!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s has a faint pleasant smell and a nice texture.</li>
            <li>Great mask for everyday use and immediately makes the skin feel much softer.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and when I took it off my skin was so soft.</li>
            <li>Afterwards my face is super soft, looks clean appears hydrated.</li>
            <li>I usually do not write reviews, but the product and service were so fantastic that I just had to.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty good mask by Skin Food, though I still prefer the Black Sugar mask.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment too!</li>
            <li>My skin was healthy and blackhead-free for about 3 days without any facial products.</li>
            <li>And it really does brighten up my skin too!</li>
            <li>will be back for more.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m able to use it daily.</li>
            <li>You need to use it consistently as directed, remember that it IS a mask</li>
            <li>Very satisfy !  </li>
            <li>I was interested in wash-off mask when my friend recommended this product.</li>
            <li>So I tried it for the first time.</li>
            <li>I do this only once a week because most of the time I am in a rush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I kept coming back to it as it looked like it would be really healthy and</li>
            <li>the reviews were pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Everything just kinda goes into your skin making it feel soft, and clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed how soft my skin feels right after rinsing!</li>
            <li>Good for every other day usage for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>me and my roommate both used it and it made our skin super soft.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t irritate my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I love using this mask during the winter season when my face gets really dry.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is light and gentle enough</li>
            <li>This mask acts as a gentle exfoliator.</li>
            <li>I use it as a gentle scrab a couple of times per week.</li>
            <li>It just acts as an gentle exfoliator</li>
            <li>but it really didn&#x27;t give brightening effect that I thought I would.</li>
            <li>this mask made my face very dry.....would not repurchase</li>
            <li>I really like this mask.</li>
            <li>I really like this company&#x27;s attiudie.</li>
            <li>Its very creamy</li>
            <li>Gentle mask</li>
            <li>The mask has granules in it, so it provides a really gentle exfoliation as you wash / rub it off.</li>
            <li>and I have really flaky skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend people to try and will continue buying it !</li>
            <li>this product is gentle on the skin</li>
            <li>really like this product</li>
            <li>and really I did it for me too.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to baby him as much.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>The texture is like diluted rice pudding-- for gently exfoliation of the face.</li>
            <li>After rinsing my skin is clear and fresh.</li>
            <li>Just gently massage a dollop around the face until the lotion has sunk into the skin, then wash it off.</li>
            <li>It did leave my face brighter and softer but it doesn&#x27;t really do anything for blackheads or tightening pores.</li>
            <li>I own quite a few</li>
            <li>I use this whenever I feel like I need to rejuvenate my face, but without doing a deep clean.</li>
            <li>After I apply this on to my skin, it is very gentle and soft.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it left my skin soft and clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lovely because some masks dry out completely while they sit - this one gets thinner</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this mask for about six months and my skin is more refined, my pores are smaller, and my overall complexion is so much brighter and healthier looking.</li>
            <li>My skin is smother and soft at the first time to using it.  </li>
            <li>right after I workout (when my face is still very sweaty) because it really works well when the pores are open and moist.</li>
            <li>: Size is decent for the amount you pay.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and advise to use with a pore closer.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because it have fairly high reviews, and now I know why.</li>
            <li>Your skin feels super soft and not dry at all after using.</li>
            <li>have sensitive, combination skin, and it works very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend steaming your face before, it helps clear your pores much easier.</li>
            <li>Also, just because it&#x27;s kind of confusing, the date on the package is the date it was produced.</li>
            <li>And I am telling you, this thing cannot possibly irritate the most sensitive of skin (but of course test on your inner wrist to see if you react before applying on your face).</li>
            <li>The exfoliation beads work, but there agents that many of them so you can use it everyday.</li>
            <li>I tried it anyway after testing it on my hand and it is still nice but not amazing.</li>
            <li>I usually use it during shower and it&#x27;s so soft and tender, just make your face super relaxed and smooth~~~</li>
            <li>A new staple in my bathroom cabinet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Makes your skin very soft and supple after use.</li>
            <li>it is literally make my skin very soft and brightening.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell bad or good to me, it just smells unique.</li>
            <li>Talk about silky soft skin!</li>
            <li>cleanse my face first, then I put the product onto my face, and massage it in, particularly the parts of my face that  are really dry.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, if you&#x27;re looking to buy one of the better SkinFood Wash-Off Masks, I would definitely recommend the Black Sugar or the Banana Yogurt over the Rice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel like you can purchase a better mask at your local drugstore at half the cost.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the core of the idea for the product really just comes from a poor-man&#x27;s facial cleanse that was popular in Asian countries, which is washing your face with rice water to both gently clean your skin AND leave behind tiny bits of the rice to soak up oil throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Overall its a good mask for a little pampering but its not really a miracle product.</li>
            <li>Feels dry after use, but definitely feels clean.  </li>
            <li>It dries on clear.</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels baby soft.</li>
            <li>Overall I really like the results it gives me</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels soft</li>
            <li>When I wash it off my skin is really soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that breaks out here and there.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin really soft and moisturised.</li>
            <li>My face warmed up a bit after 10-min massaging with this product and was soft after rinsing off.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin so soft, I don&#x27;t even need to put on moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li>So far, this mask is just so-so.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive but I don&#x27;t have any problem with the formula of this mask.</li>
            <li>Rice make the skin soft and radiant.</li>
            <li>At first when i opened it it thought the texture was weird but after applying it it was okay</li>
            <li>The rice grains help to exfoliate lightly (but can be a little abrasive- would not use this to replace an actual exfoliator) and make the texture almost like a grainy pudding.</li>
            <li>The mask didn&#x27;t live up to its claims, in fact, none of them did anything despite the different ingredients and textures.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s something that I can use every other night, or whenever I need a freshener because it&#x27;s very gentle.</li>
            <li>just moisturising i see no other difference</li>
            <li>Like many other skinfood products this packaging is quite durable but a little clunky.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a product junkie (obviously), and have used low to high end masks.</li>
            <li>After wash off,  skin feels soft and hydrate instantly !  </li>
            <li>Product ships from Korea so expect a few weeks wait time, but it was well worth it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the lasting effect as I expected and it doesn&#x27;t do much about the oily nose area.</li>
            <li>After 10-15 mins, the mask left my face feeling soft but the effect is only temporarily.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, dry, and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>it feels so soft whenever I applied it on my face, and it smells really nice too; a faint rice milky smell, not very strong either.</li>
            <li>I used it twice a week along with other skin food products, and my skin is very soft now.</li>

            <li> I have just tried this product and my skin already looks better!!</li>
            <li> AMAZING!</li>
            <li> It is great for hydrating the face and making it feel plump and bright.</li>
            <li> but it was pleasant to use &amp;</li>
            <li> My skin gets irritated very easily, but that was not an issue with this mask!</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s not like I ALWAYS eat rice for dinner, so this product is a good replacement.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got a sample from an ebay store and absolutely loved it; so I ordered 3 containers.</li>
            <li> The mask should still be good for up to three years after that date.</li>
            <li> It is a good product to take your blackheads out.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s good for what it is.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good on acne skins&lt;</li>
            <li> This mask feels very refreshing and cooling on my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Washing with rice and/or oatmeal water works wonders for my skin, so I completely love the idea of this product!</li>
            <li> I love this mask!</li>

            <li> Like all of Skinfood&#x27;s products, it smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I feel really amazing afterwards.</li>
            <li> This scrub is amazing.</li>
            <li> It is an amazing feeling when all of dirt and oily are flushed away from my skin by this rice mask.</li>
            <li> South korea in paticular has spectacular beauty products.</li>
            <li> I will probably repurchase as my skin is loving Skin Food.</li>
            <li> The texture is kind of like rice pudding but with fewer and finer &#x27;chunks&#x27;.</li>
            <li> The texture is nice too, but I wish it wasn&#x27;t scented.</li>
            <li> Love it for the price, great scent too :)</li>
            <li> I do it in the morning after the shower, and rinse it with warm water.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a off-putting smell and the consistency is nice - not too grainy like I thought it might be.</li>
            <li> I really appreciated that this seller gave samples with my purchase, they were totally awesome!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do anything spectacular</li>
            <li> The product feels nice.</li>
            <li> Loving it.</li>
            <li> Packaging is good at keeping excess water out though- under the twist on top there is a lid that keeps moisture</li>
            <li> smell nice</li>
            <li> Clean very nice, no leftover make up on my towel .</li>
            <li> i am so happy this has gone mainstream, it is a super product and at $10.00 a steal.</li>
            <li> short, it&#x27;s a good mask -- just not the best!</li>
            <li> I would say it&#x27;s good for when you want a light cleansing mask.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best exfoliant I have ever used.</li>
            <li> great smell and very gentle</li>
            <li> The product&#x27;s smell is very light.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I purchased this.</li>
            <li> This mask smells really refreshing, it has a nice light scent.</li>
            <li> I just love it.</li>
            <li> This famous product lives up to its reviews and description.</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s perfectly free!</li>
            <li> and yes more samples</li>
            <li> and I already love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering now if I can get better results from buying one that isn&#x27;t expired...</li>
            <li> It has a fresh light scent and the consistency is great.</li>
            <li> I gave 4 stars because I wish it was a tad bit more abrasive, but overall it&#x27;s an awesome product.</li>
            <li> I love this mask.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> and I love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> can purchase a better mask with this price.</li>
            <li> but im not fully sure..</li>
            <li> i need to test it out more.</li>
            <li> I love this products.</li>
            <li> I love the effectiveness of this.</li>
            <li> :) I don&#x27;t like the way that I have to massage my face.</li>
            <li> In fact, my skin looks better without makeup than it does with it.</li>
            <li> its&#x27;s refreshing  and whitening&lt;br /&gt;also</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad he uses this as well</li>
            <li> I really wanted to try out products from Skin Food since I&#x27;ve heard great things about this Korean brand.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, feels light and brightens and calms my skin.</li>
            <li> Seems more like a gimmick.</li>
            <li> will use this product often :)</li>
            <li> After i wash my face off with water, my skin immediately feels refreshed and smooth!</li>
            <li> Great product and very soft texture</li>
            <li> My skin was sooooooooooo smooth that my bf can&#x27;t stop touching and kissing me lol.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Made my skin feel soft and just happy.  </li>
            <li> This is a very mild mask.</li>
            <li> To me the smell is not distinctive or strong at all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love it as much as I love the Black Sugar scrub by Skin Food, but its good!</li>
            <li> it just makes my skin soft and brighter for one day :P</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a temporary result, but it&#x27;s nice when you first use it</li>
            <li> It has fine rice-base scrub that doesn&#x27;t scratch your skin at all.</li>
            <li> I use it in the bath and massage on my face for about 10 minutes before rinsing - super relaxing!</li>
            <li> Whenever I could feel a pimple forming, I use this mask and the pimple quickly fades away!</li>
            <li> I love the mild smell of banana as well.</li>
            <li> This mask has a nice smell to it and you feel the rice particles, I love this mask you can keep it on your face for a while and your fave is soft and smooth when you take it off.</li>
            <li> this leaves your skin bright and clear after use.</li>
            <li> After reading all the rave reviews and seeing the attractive packaging and company philosophy, I purchased 5 masks without ever testing SkinFood products (rice, blk sesame, egg white and acai berry).</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft, hydrated and bright after using it.</li>
            <li> The number eleven expression lines that were beginning to become obvious have GREATLY diminished.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face smooth and I like the scent.</li>
            <li> You will have a soft and bright skin after you wash this stuff off.</li>
            <li> : Product is smooth- almost like a lotion-</li>
            <li> My skin is nice, and soft, and smooth after I use it, no flakes or dryness!</li>
            <li> It made my complexion more fair, and overall a smoother face.</li>
            <li> Immediately after using it, my skin is nice, soft, clean, and brightened!</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin smooth and clean &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> It is worth the cost!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so excited to try it</li>
            <li> This gentle exfoliating scrub/mask is suitable for using often.</li>
            <li> Still, definitely worth buying as a gentle exfoliator and the smell is nice.</li>
            <li> I use a clean butter knife to take it out of the tub.</li>
            <li> It makes my skill feel super smooth</li>
            <li> then i rinse it with lukewarm water and sealed it with your favorite face cream and your face will be soft :)</li>
            <li> my skin feels super clean, smooth and shinny</li>
            <li> Really mild, light scent, and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing unique or special about this mask that would justify its price.</li>
            <li> This product make my face nice and very soft.</li>
            <li> Plus, I love the gentle exfoliation you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gentle exfoliation then washes off to leave skin feeling comfortable and hydrated!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also incredibly moisturizing without being too heavy.</li>
            <li> this combo mask-scrub is a pleasure to use, non-gritty and mild.</li>
            <li> results are great : my skin is soft, moist, and all the redness I had since I have a sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The only true good aspect about this mask is it feels very gentle to the skin and is probably suitable for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Skinfood is a great brand, will probably try out some of their other products as well!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what its&#x27; supposed to do!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using Skin Food products and I am hooked!</li>
            <li> Do you want a super soft and smooth face???&lt;br /&gt;Buy it!</li>
            <li> Skin food is a great line, I love the way my skin feels after this facial and the easy with little time.</li>
            <li> Brightens and exfoliates, skin always looks so fresh after this mask.</li>
            <li> I saw more results from cheap drugstore buys (even if short lived) than these.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t honestly say that it helps even out skin tone, but it definitely helps with breakouts.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use many face masks, but this makes my skin feel really soft after using it.</li>
            <li> face is getting more clear as she wished to be</li>
            <li> Nice moisturizing facial mask</li>
            <li> I will probably be repurchasing this, because I just love its texture so much, but not from this particular seller.</li>
            <li> A bit smaller than I had expected but well worth it!!!! :)</li>
            <li> Great on those days you just need a little pick me up!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s has a faint pleasant smell and a nice texture.</li>
            <li> Great mask for everyday use and immediately makes the skin feel much softer.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and when I took it off my skin was so soft.</li>
            <li> Afterwards my face is super soft, looks clean appears hydrated.</li>
            <li> I usually do not write reviews, but the product and service were so fantastic that I just had to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good mask by Skin Food, though I still prefer the Black Sugar mask.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment too!</li>
            <li> My skin was healthy and blackhead-free for about 3 days without any facial products.</li>
            <li> And it really does brighten up my skin too!</li>
            <li> will be back for more.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m able to use it daily.</li>
            <li> You need to use it consistently as directed, remember that it IS a mask</li>
            <li> Very satisfy !  </li>
            <li> I was interested in wash-off mask when my friend recommended this product.</li>
            <li> So I tried it for the first time.</li>
            <li> I do this only once a week because most of the time I am in a rush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I kept coming back to it as it looked like it would be really healthy and</li>
            <li> the reviews were pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everything just kinda goes into your skin making it feel soft, and clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed how soft my skin feels right after rinsing!</li>
            <li> Good for every other day usage for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> me and my roommate both used it and it made our skin super soft.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t irritate my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love using this mask during the winter season when my face gets really dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is light and gentle enough</li>
            <li> This mask acts as a gentle exfoliator.</li>
            <li> I use it as a gentle scrab a couple of times per week.</li>
            <li> It just acts as an gentle exfoliator</li>
            <li> but it really didn&#x27;t give brightening effect that I thought I would.</li>
            <li> this mask made my face very dry.....would not repurchase</li>
            <li> I really like this mask.</li>
            <li> I really like this company&#x27;s attiudie.</li>
            <li> Its very creamy</li>
            <li> Gentle mask</li>
            <li> The mask has granules in it, so it provides a really gentle exfoliation as you wash / rub it off.</li>
            <li> and I have really flaky skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend people to try and will continue buying it !</li>
            <li> this product is gentle on the skin</li>
            <li> really like this product</li>
            <li> and really I did it for me too.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to baby him as much.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The texture is like diluted rice pudding-- for gently exfoliation of the face.</li>
            <li> After rinsing my skin is clear and fresh.</li>
            <li> Just gently massage a dollop around the face until the lotion has sunk into the skin, then wash it off.</li>
            <li> It did leave my face brighter and softer but it doesn&#x27;t really do anything for blackheads or tightening pores.</li>
            <li> I own quite a few</li>
            <li> I use this whenever I feel like I need to rejuvenate my face, but without doing a deep clean.</li>
            <li> After I apply this on to my skin, it is very gentle and soft.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it left my skin soft and clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lovely because some masks dry out completely while they sit - this one gets thinner</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mask for about six months and my skin is more refined, my pores are smaller, and my overall complexion is so much brighter and healthier looking.</li>
            <li> My skin is smother and soft at the first time to using it.  </li>
            <li> right after I workout (when my face is still very sweaty) because it really works well when the pores are open and moist.</li>
            <li> : Size is decent for the amount you pay.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and advise to use with a pore closer.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it have fairly high reviews, and now I know why.</li>
            <li> Your skin feels super soft and not dry at all after using.</li>
            <li> have sensitive, combination skin, and it works very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend steaming your face before, it helps clear your pores much easier.</li>
            <li> Also, just because it&#x27;s kind of confusing, the date on the package is the date it was produced.</li>
            <li> And I am telling you, this thing cannot possibly irritate the most sensitive of skin (but of course test on your inner wrist to see if you react before applying on your face).</li>
            <li> The exfoliation beads work, but there agents that many of them so you can use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I tried it anyway after testing it on my hand and it is still nice but not amazing.</li>
            <li> I usually use it during shower and it&#x27;s so soft and tender, just make your face super relaxed and smooth~~~</li>
            <li> A new staple in my bathroom cabinet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Makes your skin very soft and supple after use.</li>
            <li> it is literally make my skin very soft and brightening.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad or good to me, it just smells unique.</li>
            <li> Talk about silky soft skin!</li>
            <li> cleanse my face first, then I put the product onto my face, and massage it in, particularly the parts of my face that  are really dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, if you&#x27;re looking to buy one of the better SkinFood Wash-Off Masks, I would definitely recommend the Black Sugar or the Banana Yogurt over the Rice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel like you can purchase a better mask at your local drugstore at half the cost.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the core of the idea for the product really just comes from a poor-man&#x27;s facial cleanse that was popular in Asian countries, which is washing your face with rice water to both gently clean your skin AND leave behind tiny bits of the rice to soak up oil throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Overall its a good mask for a little pampering but its not really a miracle product.</li>
            <li> Feels dry after use, but definitely feels clean.  </li>
            <li> It dries on clear.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels baby soft.</li>
            <li> Overall I really like the results it gives me</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels soft</li>
            <li> When I wash it off my skin is really soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that breaks out here and there.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin really soft and moisturised.</li>
            <li> My face warmed up a bit after 10-min massaging with this product and was soft after rinsing off.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin so soft, I don&#x27;t even need to put on moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li> So far, this mask is just so-so.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive but I don&#x27;t have any problem with the formula of this mask.</li>
            <li> Rice make the skin soft and radiant.</li>
            <li> At first when i opened it it thought the texture was weird but after applying it it was okay</li>
            <li> The rice grains help to exfoliate lightly (but can be a little abrasive- would not use this to replace an actual exfoliator) and make the texture almost like a grainy pudding.</li>
            <li> The mask didn&#x27;t live up to its claims, in fact, none of them did anything despite the different ingredients and textures.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s something that I can use every other night, or whenever I need a freshener because it&#x27;s very gentle.</li>
            <li> just moisturising i see no other difference</li>
            <li> Like many other skinfood products this packaging is quite durable but a little clunky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a product junkie (obviously), and have used low to high end masks.</li>
            <li> After wash off,  skin feels soft and hydrate instantly !  </li>
            <li> Product ships from Korea so expect a few weeks wait time, but it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the lasting effect as I expected and it doesn&#x27;t do much about the oily nose area.</li>
            <li> After 10-15 mins, the mask left my face feeling soft but the effect is only temporarily.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, dry, and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> it feels so soft whenever I applied it on my face, and it smells really nice too; a faint rice milky smell, not very strong either.</li>
            <li> I used it twice a week along with other skin food products, and my skin is very soft now.</li>
            <li> It gives a glow to your skin, it feels very moisturizing and the grains aren&#x27;t too rough or sharp.</li>
            <li> This product was not too harsh, and really helped with my dry skin; however, I wish the feeling lasted longer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the effects last that long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it almost daily since receiving my order and my skin has not been happier in a long time.</li>
            <li> Has little rice bits to exfoliate the skin, but this product doesn&#x27;t really live up to all the hype imo.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin crazy soft &amp; smooth, but</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and my face is clear and even!</li>
            <li> so I will have to see what the long term effects are</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels the exact same with a thin layer of film after use.  </li>
            <li> , our ages are 29-60, between the three of us we all have diffrent skn types, mines is a combination of oily and dry.</li>
            <li> put it on after I dry off from a shower.</li>
            <li> so I figure I can dry off, get dressed, and make some breakfast while it&#x27;s sitting.</li>
            <li> It has a really light scent and the texture can be a little weird at first, like a thick lotion with some rice particles in it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it quite frequently (as I rotate my wash-off masks) and it definitely softens my skin and makes it subtle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now, and not a single breakout.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to rub against his rough dry skin and look at it peeling.  </li>
            <li> Felt a little too harsh for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Once I rinsed, none- absolutely no blackheads even visible.</li>
            <li> this had an odd texture like bits of rice otherwise nothing strange for those on the fence about overseas products.</li>
            <li> but it suppose to have less blackheads after you use it for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to continue using this mask to see any other difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about other people</li>
            <li> I use it before bed every other day.  </li>
            <li> Due to it being like lotion</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> HOLY COW</li>
            <li> Also, the packaging which it arrived in was a pain because it was just a styrofoam container of sorts wrapped in layers upon layers of tape which took me at least ten minutes to hack through &amp; styrofoam bits got everwear.</li>
            <li> like using at least some sort of facial scrub</li>
            <li> typically korean products are stamped with the date made in the factory.  </li>
            <li> Everyone who likes this mask should also try the Black Sugar Mask Wash Off.</li>
            <li> what I like to do after I exfoliate my face is take a little bit of this  and start massaging it on my skin in circular motion for about 5 minutes</li>
            <li> I use a little bit on my face and like to massage it before rinsing.</li>
            <li> The pores minimize but not greatly- maybe with daily use, a minimizer won&#x27;t be needed.</li>
            <li> After using it a few times, I see her redness was reduced and my flakiness is gone.</li>
            <li> I massage the product on and leave it for a few minutes before washing off.</li>
            <li> but I also noticed that my small scar is fading little by little with the continuous use of this mask.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d also say it helps even my skin tone a little too!</li>
            <li> for the size, the jar looks small</li>
            <li> but with small rice grains in it.</li>
            <li> 1 tub lasts me at least four months with twice a week</li>
            <li> I live in Chicago and winter makes my skin dry so bad that there are times when I scratch on it so bad that I start bleeding I also suffer from dandruff btw.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is that the plastic protective lid thing is really thin and flimsy and doesn&#x27;t have any handle.</li>
            <li> I had to share it with him as his skin is worse than mine</li>
            <li> There is no strong chemical odor or anything unpleasant.</li>
            <li> My face always gets dry after I wash it, and I hate having that flakey look that lasts even after my skin starts to get oily again.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I would not repurchase or recommend any of these.</li>
            <li> but it does NOT get uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Sebum literally roles out of my pores when I wash the rice mask off with cold water.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> However, when sometimes I accidently drop some in my mouth, it is disgusting...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I had the opportunity to visit SouthKorea and discovered this about five years ago.  i am so happy this has gone mainstream, it is a super product and at $10.00 a steal. i recently purchased this last month from amazon and the expiration the date made and the day it expires.  typically korean products are stamped with the date made in the factory.  i bought one of these for my aunt,mother, our ages are 29-60, between the three of us we all have diffrent skn types, mines is a combination of oily and dry. this had an odd texture like bits of rice otherwise nothing strange for those on the fence about overseas products. South korea in paticular has spectacular beauty products.</li>
            <li> Great product, I tried it yesterday and it&#x27;s a diff type of scrub mask I&#x27;ve used. Everything just kinda goes into your skin making it feel soft, and clean. Fast shipment too!</li>
            <li> Wonderful. My skin looks and feels baby soft. I am so glad I purchased this.</li>
            <li> Has alcohol in the ingredient list. Felt a little too harsh for my sensitive skin. I did like the rice pieces for exfoliating though.</li>
            <li> This mask smells really refreshing, it has a nice light scent. After using it my skin feels smoother and healthier. I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> HOLY COW DO I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!  It makes my skin crazy soft &amp; smooth, but no breakouts!  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now, and not a single breakout.  I just love it.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best mask I have ever had!!! I will definitely buy it again. After I apply this on to my skin, it is very gentle and soft. I used it twice a week along with other skin food products, and my skin is very soft now. It is worth the cost!</li>
            <li> This famous product lives up to its reviews and description. Like all of Skinfood&#x27;s products, it smells AMAZING. Plus, I love the gentle exfoliation you get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the core of the idea for the product really just comes from a poor-man&#x27;s facial cleanse that was popular in Asian countries, which is washing your face with rice water to both gently clean your skin AND leave behind tiny bits of the rice to soak up oil throughout the day. And that&#x27;s perfectly free! However, it&#x27;s not like I ALWAYS eat rice for dinner, so this product is a good replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Washing with rice and/or oatmeal water works wonders for my skin, so I completely love the idea of this product!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, dry, and acne prone skin. This product was not too harsh, and really helped with my dry skin; however, I wish the feeling lasted longer. I notice when I use the product at night, in the morning the feeling is gone. Still, definitely worth buying as a gentle exfoliator and the smell is nice. I will probably repurchase as my skin is loving Skin Food.</li>
            <li> I just got this and I&#x27;m so excited to try it but from the reviews I know I will like it and yes more samples</li>
            <li> This mask acts as a gentle exfoliator. It&#x27;s has a faint pleasant smell and a nice texture. I use it as a gentle scrab a couple of times per week. It also has whitenning quality.</li>
            <li> I got a sample from an ebay store and absolutely loved it; so I ordered 3 containers. I have oily-combination skin and blackheads on my nose and upper cheeks. I scrubbed my face by hand for about 10 min. and you can feel the freshness and hydration enter your pores. Once I rinsed, none- absolutely no blackheads even visible. I highly recommend this product and advise to use with a pore closer. The pores minimize but not greatly- maybe with daily use, a minimizer won&#x27;t be needed. My skin was healthy and blackhead-free for about 3 days without any facial products.</li>
            <li> My face always gets dry after I wash it, and I hate having that flakey look that lasts even after my skin starts to get oily again. I just got this product reccently and I already love it. My skin is nice, and soft, and smooth after I use it, no flakes or dryness! The texture is kind of like rice pudding but with fewer and finer &#x27;chunks&#x27;. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad or good to me, it just smells unique. Overall I really like the results it gives me and I&#x27;d also say it helps even my skin tone a little too! Also, just because it&#x27;s kind of confusing, the date on the package is the date it was produced. It&#x27;s not the expiration date. The mask should still be good for up to three years after that date.</li>
            <li> Great mask for everyday use and immediately makes the skin feel much softer. I will repurchase once i run out!</li>
            <li> just moisturising i see no other difference</li>
            <li> When I received this product in the mail it had already been expired for over 5 months. I tried it anyway after testing it on my hand and it is still nice but not amazing. It just acts as an gentle exfoliator but it was pleasant to use &amp; I like its texture. I&#x27;m wondering now if I can get better results from buying one that isn&#x27;t expired...*sigh* Also, the packaging which it arrived in was a pain because it was just a styrofoam container of sorts wrapped in layers upon layers of tape which took me at least ten minutes to hack through &amp; styrofoam bits got everwear. I will probably be repurchasing this, because I just love its texture so much, but not from this particular seller. Thank you though!</li>
            <li> This mask has a nice smell to it and you feel the rice particles, I love this mask you can keep it on your face for a while and your fave is soft and smooth when you take it off. I use it twice a week</li>
            <li> I love this mask! Immediately after using it, my skin is nice, soft, clean, and brightened! Sometimes it&#x27;s a pain to remove the rice tho lol. Otherwise, good!</li>
            <li> Best mask I have! A definite repurchase. I like that this product claims to brighten/whiten and soften skin, and it lives up to its claims. It&#x27;s something that I can use every other night, or whenever I need a freshener because it&#x27;s very gentle.</li>
            <li> Do you want a super soft and smooth face???&lt;br /&gt;Buy it!</li>
            <li> I have combination dehydrated  skin. This mask did great at at hydrating skin but it really didn&#x27;t give brightening effect that I thought I would. I only used once thought so I will have to see what the long term effects are but I must say that the hydration from mask is wonderful . My skin looks and feels soft so I would definitely recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way. I use a clean butter knife to take it out of the tub. This is great for day in between masks. Leaves my pores visibly cleaner and tighter. Feels wonderful on my skin, with a pleasant scent. Will reorder.</li>
            <li> this mask made my face very dry.....would not repurchase</li>
            <li> I really like this mask. It has a fresh light scent and the consistency is great. When I wash it off my skin is really soft and moisturized. Overall its a good mask for a little pampering but its not really a miracle product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It makes my skill feel super smooth and it&#x27;s so hydrating!</li>
            <li> I just got mine recently and used it just now. I&#x27;m amazed how soft my skin feels right after rinsing! The texture is nice too, but I wish it wasn&#x27;t scented. I&#x27;m going to continue using this mask to see any other difference.&lt;br /&gt;***EDIT***&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so in love with this rice mask now! After one use, my face doesn&#x27;t feel oily the next day! And it really does brighten up my skin too!</li>
            <li> this leaves your skin bright and clear after use. It got rid of the oil so I don&#x27;t breakout. I was happy with this purchase. will be back for more.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that breaks out here and there. And I am telling you, this thing cannot possibly irritate the most sensitive of skin (but of course test on your inner wrist to see if you react before applying on your face). I gave 4 stars because I wish it was a tad bit more abrasive, but overall it&#x27;s an awesome product. I use it in the bath and massage on my face for about 10 minutes before rinsing - super relaxing! A great moisturizing scrub for dry/sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> great smell and very gentle</li>
            <li> Great masks and great for any skin type! Leaves my skin smooth and clean &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> this combo mask-scrub is a pleasure to use, non-gritty and mild. if you have reactive skin, as I do, do a patch test.</li>
            <li> I love this mask. Tried it on last night when I took a shower. I massaged it on my face for around 3-4 minutes then left it there for another 15 minutes. And when I rinsed it off, oh.my.god. My skin was sooooooooooo smooth that my bf can&#x27;t stop touching and kissing me lol.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive, combination skin, and it works very well.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what its&#x27; supposed to do! me and my roommate both used it and it made our skin super soft. Great on those days you just need a little pick me up!</li>
            <li> Good for every other day usage for my sensitive skin.  Feels dry after use, but definitely feels clean.  Must use lotion afterwards.</li>
            <li> It is a good product to take your blackheads out. They will appear again the next morning but it suppose to have less blackheads after you use it for a long time. I really like this company&#x27;s attiudie.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it have fairly high reviews, and now I know why. :)This mask feels very refreshing and cooling on my skin. Its very creamy and I love the way it makes my skin feel. My skin gets irritated very easily, but that was not an issue with this mask!</li>
            <li> This product make my face nice and very soft. Clean very nice, no leftover make up on my towel .</li>
            <li> Gentle mask so I&#x27;m able to use it daily. Gentle exfoliation then washes off to leave skin feeling comfortable and hydrated! Love it for the price, great scent too :)</li>
            <li> AMAZING! Brightens and exfoliates, skin always looks so fresh after this mask.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed with this purchase. After reading all the rave reviews and seeing the attractive packaging and company philosophy, I purchased 5 masks without ever testing SkinFood products (rice, blk sesame, egg white and acai berry). One by one, I was underwhelmed. The mask didn&#x27;t live up to its claims, in fact, none of them did anything despite the different ingredients and textures. I&#x27;m a product junkie (obviously), and have used low to high end masks. I saw more results from cheap drugstore buys (even if short lived) than these. My skin looks and feels the exact same with a thin layer of film after use.  Needless to say, I would not repurchase or recommend any of these.</li>
            <li> Oh, man. Whenever I have a break out, this is the go-to mask. I do it in the morning after the shower, and rinse it with warm water. The mask has granules in it, so it provides a really gentle exfoliation as you wash / rub it off. It&#x27;s also incredibly moisturizing without being too heavy. A new staple in my bathroom cabinet. I can&#x27;t honestly say that it helps even out skin tone, but it definitely helps with breakouts.</li>
            <li> I love this. It&#x27;s amazing. Makes my skin really soft and moisturised. The exfoliation beads work, but there agents that many of them so you can use it everyday. The only bad thing is that the plastic protective lid thing is really thin and flimsy and doesn&#x27;t have any handle. I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Excellent scrub!!</li>
            <li> I usually use it during shower and it&#x27;s so soft and tender, just make your face super relaxed and smooth~~~</li>
            <li> So I struggle with stress acne from work and literally this stuff was like a miracle! It cleared up my skin, it made my pores smaller AND evened out my redness. I leave it on way longer than 15 minutes though and then massage it around while it sets. I will definitely keep this around!</li>
            <li> Smoothest face ever! Only use once a week but share with my daughters. Talk about silky soft skin! Love it!!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product. There isn&#x27;t a off-putting smell and the consistency is nice - not too grainy like I thought it might be. It is great for hydrating the face and making it feel plump and bright. Skinfood is a great brand, will probably try out some of their other products as well!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It is easy to apply and when I took it off my skin was so soft. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> It is a great mask. It can wash off dead skin, and also it is very moisturized. However, when sometimes I accidently drop some in my mouth, it is disgusting...</li>
            <li> You need to use it consistently as directed, remember that it IS a mask so try to have time to leave it on. My sister and I have been using it on our DRY/COMBINATION skin. She has really red puffy dots on her cheeks and I have really flaky skin. After using it a few times, I see her redness was reduced and my flakiness is gone. In addition I also put on skinfood&#x27;s avocado emulsion on afterwards overnight as a nightly moisterizer. But I can say that it works.</li>
            <li> I really love the smell of this! So relaxing! And it does with it&#x27;s supposed to do! I use it everyday and my face is clear and even! I will buy this again!</li>
            <li> I usually do not write reviews, but the product and service were so fantastic that I just had to. I ordered the products and received them after a couple of days, not even a week after their purchase! The condition of the products was also great as well. There was no damage what so ever! I really appreciated that this seller gave samples with my purchase, they were totally awesome! Definitely going to order again!!</li>
            <li> I live in Chicago and winter makes my skin dry so bad that there are times when I scratch on it so bad that I start bleeding I also suffer from dandruff btw. The first time I used it left my skin soft and clean. I didn&#x27;t even used lotion, so the only thing I used was the solely the rice mask. I only use it 1-2x a week before I take a shower. My skin is practically perfect !</li>
            <li> Very satisfy !  Perfect consitancy !  Not runny.  After wash off,  skin feels soft and hydrate instantly !  Highly recommend people to try and will continue buying it !</li>
            <li> I own quite a few Skin Food Wash-Off Masks, in particular the Black Sugar and Banana Yogurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the rice and I do like it -- I use it quite frequently (as I rotate my wash-off masks) and it definitely softens my skin and makes it subtle. In that respect, it&#x27;s a very good mask and I definitely recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you&#x27;re looking to buy one of the better SkinFood Wash-Off Masks, I would definitely recommend the Black Sugar or the Banana Yogurt over the Rice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, it&#x27;s a good mask -- just not the best!</li>
            <li> can purchase a better mask with this price.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t irritate my super sensitive skin. i dont think it gives me acne but im not fully sure.. i need to test it out more. it just makes my skin soft and brighter for one day :P</li>
            <li> I would like to buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is a very mild mask. Your skin feels super soft and not dry at all after using. It&#x27;s almost like washing your face with rice pudding. There is no strong chemical odor or anything unpleasant. I would say it&#x27;s good for when you want a light cleansing mask. It doesn&#x27;t do anything spectacular but it&#x27;s good for what it is.</li>
            <li> I was interested in wash-off mask when my friend recommended this product. So I tried it for the first time. The product&#x27;s smell is very light. My face warmed up a bit after 10-min massaging with this product and was soft after rinsing off. But the softness was gone on the next day. It doesn&#x27;t have the lasting effect as I expected and it doesn&#x27;t do much about the oily nose area.</li>
            <li> A really great mask! Leaves my skin so soft, I don&#x27;t even need to put on moisturizer afterwards. It made my complexion more fair, and overall a smoother face. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Has little rice bits to exfoliate the skin, but this product doesn&#x27;t really live up to all the hype imo.</li>
            <li> this product is gentle on the skin and I feel refresh afterwards!</li>
            <li> Skin food is a great line, I love the way my skin feels after this facial and the easy with little time.</li>
            <li> Great product and very soft texture&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend this product to my friends and family</li>
            <li> I love this products. My skin feels so soft, hydrated and bright after using it. I don&#x27;t know about other people but I also noticed that my small scar is fading little by little with the continuous use of this mask. I only use it once or twice a week if needed and its been working great.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely repurchase on amazon although the one I currently have was given to me by a Korean friend.</li>
            <li> I love using this mask during the winter season when my face gets really dry. It has a really light scent and the texture can be a little weird at first, like a thick lotion with some rice particles in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cleanse my face first, then I put the product onto my face, and massage it in, particularly the parts of my face that  are really dry. I do this for about 2 or 3 minutes and just wash it off. Afterwards my face is super soft, looks clean appears hydrated. I do this only once a week because most of the time I am in a rush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is light and gentle enough that if you wanted to, you could you this rice mask every day and keep the product on longer.</li>
            <li> **EDIT after using a while**&lt;br /&gt;I like using at least some sort of facial scrub so I decided to look for a mask that also worked as a scrub (I like to have it feel like it&#x27;s doing something). I found this and made a note while I kept searching but I kept coming back to it as it looked like it would be really healthy and the reviews were pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on after I dry off from a shower. It&#x27;s supposed to sit for 15 minutes so I figure I can dry off, get dressed, and make some breakfast while it&#x27;s sitting. It&#x27;s lovely because some masks dry out completely while they sit - this one gets thinner but it does NOT get uncomfortable. I could almost forget it&#x27;s there. By the time I&#x27;m done with breakfast I go rinse off my face and continue with my face/makeup routine.&lt;br /&gt;Every time I&#x27;ve used it I feel really amazing afterwards. My skin has definitely softened from using this as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the size, the jar looks small but I feel like it&#x27;s going to last me for several months. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Whenever I could feel a pimple forming, I use this mask and the pimple quickly fades away! I love the effectiveness of this.</li>
            <li> Its a very nice mask and hydrating! what I like to do after I exfoliate my face is take a little bit of this  and start massaging it on my skin in circular motion for about 5 minutes then i rinse it with lukewarm water and sealed it with your favorite face cream and your face will be soft :)</li>
            <li> The product feels nice. I don&#x27;t use many face masks, but this makes my skin feel really soft after using it. I don&#x27;t think the effects last that long, it&#x27;s a temporary result, but it&#x27;s nice when you first use it and it gives you a brighter and fresher look for the day.</li>
            <li> I use this rice mask wash off after cleansing. Every time after I use it, I feel my face is brighter, but maybe it&#x27;s just my feeling. :) I don&#x27;t like the way that I have to massage my face. I thought it&#x27;s a mask that you just put it on your face and wait for 15 min and then wash it off when I bought it.</li>
            <li> I like to use this rice mask right after I workout (when my face is still very sweaty) because it really works well when the pores are open and moist. Sebum literally roles out of my pores when I wash the rice mask off with cold water. I&#x27;ve been using this mask for about six months and my skin is more refined, my pores are smaller, and my overall complexion is so much brighter and healthier looking. The number eleven expression lines that were beginning to become obvious have GREATLY diminished. I don&#x27;t need to wear any powder,concealer, or foundation anymore because of this mask. In fact, my skin looks better without makeup than it does with it. This is by far the best exfoliant I have ever used.</li>
            <li> its&#x27;s refreshing  and whitening&lt;br /&gt;also it&#x27;s good on acne skins&lt;br /&gt;her face is getting more clear as she wished to be</li>
            <li> Nice moisturizing facial mask</li>
            <li> Love this product. Made my skin feel soft and just happy.  I have normal-dry skin and using this my skin felt great. I use it before bed every other day.  My boyfriend got hooked on it, and loves it.  I had to share it with him as his skin is worse than mine and really I did it for me too. I didn&#x27;t want to rub against his rough dry skin and look at it peeling.  He needs care and I&#x27;m glad he uses this as well so I don&#x27;t have to baby him as much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good mask by Skin Food, though I still prefer the Black Sugar mask. (: I use this whenever I feel like I need to rejuvenate my face, but without doing a deep clean. I&#x27;d recommend this line to anyone!</li>
            <li> i like this mask cause after use it my skin feels super clean, smooth and shinny</li>
            <li> This mask is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes your skin very soft and supple after use. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love it as much as I love the Black Sugar scrub by Skin Food, but its good!</li>
            <li> My skin is smother and soft at the first time to using it.  I love the mild smell of banana as well.</li>
            <li> Great! Really mild, light scent, and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I have just tried this product and my skin already looks better!! It gives a glow to your skin, it feels very moisturizing and the grains aren&#x27;t too rough or sharp. I recommend steaming your face before, it helps clear your pores much easier. A bit smaller than I had expected but well worth it!!!! :)</li>
            <li> This is my first time using Skin Food products and I am hooked! I bought this mask as well as their peach sake pore serum and am very happy with both. This gentle exfoliating scrub/mask is suitable for using often. I&#x27;ve used it almost daily since receiving my order and my skin has not been happier in a long time. I massage the product on and leave it for a few minutes before washing off. Product ships from Korea so expect a few weeks wait time, but it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to try out products from Skin Food since I&#x27;ve heard great things about this Korean brand. So far, this mask is just so-so. The texture is like diluted rice pudding-- for gently exfoliation of the face. It dries on clear. To me the smell is not distinctive or strong at all. After 10-15 mins, the mask left my face feeling soft but the effect is only temporarily. The only true good aspect about this mask is it feels very gentle to the skin and is probably suitable for people with sensitive skin. There&#x27;s nothing unique or special about this mask that would justify its price. I feel like you can purchase a better mask at your local drugstore at half the cost.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this. Everyone who likes this mask should also try the Black Sugar Mask Wash Off.</li>
            <li> Loving it. it is literally make my skin very soft and brightening. I used it 2-3 times a week and my pore seem to visibly smaller!</li>
            <li> It leaves my face smooth and I like the scent.</li>
            <li> This scrub is amazing. It smells nice, feels light and brightens and calms my skin. I use a little bit on my face and like to massage it before rinsing. After rinsing my skin is clear and fresh. The mask itself isn&#x27;t very gritty, I would compare the texture to rice pudding.</li>
            <li> You will have a soft and bright skin after you wash this stuff off. It is an amazing feeling when all of dirt and oily are flushed away from my skin by this rice mask. It has fine rice-base scrub that doesn&#x27;t scratch your skin at all. My skin is sensitive but I don&#x27;t have any problem with the formula of this mask. Before using this stuff, I often washed my face with rice water. Rice make the skin soft and radiant. With this philosophy, the rice mask would have the same effect to your skin. Give it a try!</li>
            <li> Skin clarifying effect is very brief. Seems more like a gimmick. It does have a fragrant smell and it does moisturize skin well.</li>
            <li> Packaging: Like many other skinfood products this packaging is quite durable but a little clunky. If travelling you will definitely need a different container. Packaging is good at keeping excess water out though- under the twist on top there is a lid that keeps moisture out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Size: Size is decent for the amount you pay. You do not need to use a lot of the product to get desired effects. 1 tub lasts me at least four months with twice a week usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product: Product is smooth- almost like a lotion- but with small rice grains in it. The rice grains help to exfoliate lightly (but can be a little abrasive- would not use this to replace an actual exfoliator) and make the texture almost like a grainy pudding. Due to it being like lotion you do NOT need a lot of product to cover the face. Just gently massage a dollop around the face until the lotion has sunk into the skin, then wash it off. Leaves my complexion noticeably brighter and smoother- feels very good as well. It doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything for whitening however.</li>
            <li> Best mask from skin food.. Getting my third bottler soon. smell nice</li>
            <li> I think this is a great mask for when you need to give your skin some tlc. It did leave my face brighter and softer but it doesn&#x27;t really do anything for blackheads or tightening pores.</li>
            <li> At first when i opened it it thought the texture was weird but after applying it it was okay&lt;br /&gt;The results are great : my skin is soft, moist, and all the redness I had since I have a sensitive skin disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;I will use this product often :)</li>
            <li> I love this mask! it feels so soft whenever I applied it on my face, and it smells really nice too; a faint rice milky smell, not very strong either. After i wash my face off with water, my skin immediately feels refreshed and smooth!</li>
