    <ol>
            <li>Package arrived in time and in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li>The seller is great.</li>
            <li>It just creates a beautiful nude-purple ombre that gets more sparkly toward the tip.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this glitter!  </li>
            <li>I love it though!</li>
            <li>I just really want the BLUEBELL that I ordered!!!!!</li>
            <li>Kind of upset about this.</li>
            <li>I just received my new polish and the color is beautiful!  </li>
            <li>the price is super duper great as i can&#x27;t find this in my area anywhere...</li>
            <li>but more of a transparent top coat than what it appears to be.  </li>
            <li>The polish has lasted more than a week on my nails.</li>
            <li>and i have gotten so many compliments ..</li>
            <li>If I would of paid more than 2$ for it</li>
            <li>I would of thought you would of seen more purple and shine</li>
            <li>i have to say that i absolutely love this polish....</li>
            <li>more you layer it, the more depth you get in the variety of color in the sparkle.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s how I create my favorite glitzy/nude/ombre style with this product:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Use as top coat.  </li>
            <li>It is labeled BLUEBELL but the color in the bottle is more af</li>
            <li>favorite thing about this color is how easy it is to play with the layering and building the colors.</li>
            <li>thanks so much you guys are awesome</li>
            <li>Thanks Eau Claire for shipping quick and making this a great experience.</li>
            <li>I wrote to the seller and they shipped me a replacement right away, which was nice.  </li>
            <li>You can create a very smooth ombre effect so easily, without any special tools or technique.</li>
            <li>either way, it is pretty and will make a nice addition to my collection</li>
            <li>The kind of look that doesn&#x27;t scream for attention with a bold color, but just catches the eye in an intriguing way that makes people grab by hand to demand a closer look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>And certainly doesn&#x27;t show up on its own.</li>
            <li>Then finish with a topcoat to smooth out the surface.</li>
            <li>It has a pretty glitter in it, and would be great (as other reviewers have noted) as a top coat on a darker polish.</li>
            <li>So there are a lot of reviews that complain that this color doesn&#x27;t come out looking like it does in the bottle, which is true, but hear me out...</li>
            <li>It was really cheap, so it was worth it- maybe?</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t show up with a full color under it.</li>
            <li>I plan on buying the whole Kleancolor line, so excited!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the colors in this nail polish, to the point that I wish my car could be the same color :)  </li>
            <li>Finishing with a fast-drying high quality top coat (like butter Hardwear, or Seche Vite) helps a LOT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am still ok with having it in my nail polish collection, but not sure if I want to buy more of this series.</li>
            <li>The polish&#x27;s sparkle is pretty, a burgundy/purple color.</li>
            <li>The polish came exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>I would of been very upset!</li>
            <li>this color was not what i expected, but nice addition to my polishes.</li>
            <li>the color I got though is pretty</li>
            <li>The polish is very light, and even several coats didn&#x27;t really show any color.</li>
            <li>so I ordered this color due to the fact it is so pretty and purple is my favorite color.</li>
            <li>If you want a light shimmer then this is definitely it!</li>
            <li>originally found this color in a random low end beauty supply store, and am SOOO happy that I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>i bought this to go on top of blues, purples and maybe black polish...to bring out the colors.</li>
            <li>The glitter itself is clear flake style (not chunky) with a very warm opalescence to it; very orangey, pink, then green.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m really into manicure looks that are kind of natural with a subtle element of color or sparkle to them, and this really fits the bill.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clear type polish with lots of different colored sparkles, looks awesome over other colors such as pink.  </li>
            <li>When I saw the word \\&quot;holographic\\&quot; I assumed it was one of the new holographic polishes that change color as you change your view of the nails.</li>
            <li>just gives you a delicate but lively shimmer, but then you can layer it up, and thats when I REALLY start to love</li>
            <li>Was too clear for me because I wanted to use alone.</li>
            <li>It is a clear glitter polish that may stand out once you put it over a darker color.</li>
            <li>It is basically a clear polish with colored glitter.</li>
            <li>3rd coat is from the halfway point to the tip, and then 1/4, and a lil on the very tip.</li>
            <li>Like the other reviews say, it&#x27;s a CLEAR polish with glitter in it, which would be fine, but the glitter is all of about 5 tiny pieces per brushfull.</li>
            <li>Pretty (however, different from what&#x27;s pictured) and very-very-very-very sheer!</li>
            <li>At first I was disappointed, but I love this color in a whole new way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got my bottle in the mail and it was a ruby red glitter with very mild, faint golden shine.</li>
            <li>BUT if you use with a nice base color like pink, purple, black or blue will be great.</li>
            <li>Barely there.</li>
            <li>The purple base color remains sheer, even with many coats, but the color does build up and become more vivid.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Depending on the length of your nails, the following layers are applied in tiers, leaving a single layer at the base of the nail bed, and building more and more toward the tip.</li>
            <li>So I generally follow with a 2nd coat that starts 1/3 (of the nail length)</li>
            <li>This nail polish is almost completely clear, and has not much color or sparkle to it.</li>

            <li> This polish is smelly and slow to dry, but has a pretty glitter and has a holo jelly look.</li>
            <li> This is a clear topcoat with a few pieces of glitter in it.</li>
            <li> a single coat, it is very sheer, almost clear, with a very sheer subtle purpley hue.</li>
            <li> To get that look you have to layer it over a darker color and there is no Blue, Green or Yellow in it.</li>
            <li> So to use it as a single coat alone or over another color</li>
            <li> : this polish can be a bit thick and slow to dry, especially with multiple coats, so I advise applying thin, light coats and letting it dry a bit between layers.</li>
            <li> Orange and Pink.</li>
            <li> start with a nude base over the whole nail, give it a minute to dry a bit, then apply one coat of this product over the whole nail.</li>
            <li> The polish is goopy and thick and takes a very long time to dry.</li>
            <li> I received my order today which along with tis I ordered the holo black and the set of 12 metallic.</li>
            <li> Looks a little sparkly.  </li>
            <li> just very thin, clear coat with some sparkles.</li>
            <li> and even if your put it over black nail polish it still sucks....</li>
            <li> Hardly anything.  </li>
            <li> color aside, the nail polish is no good.</li>
            <li> You definitely need a base color coat before you apply this.  </li>
            <li> Not happy at all with it ,was not the colour</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s crazy...</li>
            <li> the smell i am not too crazy about BUT will endure it for the look.  </li>
            <li> Disappointing</li>
            <li> its horrible, thick, clumpy n sticky!</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was quite disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this glitter!  You definitely need a base color coat before you apply this.  And it doesn&#x27;t show up with the actually color that&#x27;s shown here, just the glitter itself.  I love it though!</li>
            <li> but more of a transparent top coat than what it appears to be.  i thought it was actually the color as shown and could be worn alone.  either way, it is pretty and will make a nice addition to my collection</li>
            <li> Pretty (however, different from what&#x27;s pictured) and very-very-very-very sheer! Barely there. I am still ok with having it in my nail polish collection, but not sure if I want to buy more of this series.</li>
            <li> Was too clear for me because I wanted to use alone. If you will use alone will need around 5 coat BUT if you use with a nice base color like pink, purple, black or blue will be great.</li>
            <li> It does not look like this. It is a clear glitter polish that may stand out once you put it over a darker color. So not liking this.. The seller is great. I got it in the nick of time.</li>
            <li> When I saw the word \\&quot;holographic\\&quot; I assumed it was one of the new holographic polishes that change color as you change your view of the nails. This product is not that type of holographic, the seller might consider rewording the description because others might assume this as well. The polish is very light, and even several coats didn&#x27;t really show any color. It has a pretty glitter in it, and would be great (as other reviewers have noted) as a top coat on a darker polish. The polish&#x27;s sparkle is pretty, a burgundy/purple color. The polish has lasted more than a week on my nails. Granted without an all over color, I can not judge whether it would have chipped by now. It is basically a clear polish with colored glitter.</li>
            <li> it looks NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE!!!!!!!!!! and even if your put it over black nail polish it still sucks....the picture is misleading, save your money</li>
            <li> This polish is smelly and slow to dry, but has a pretty glitter and has a holo jelly look. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying lean color again.</li>
            <li> I got my bottle in the mail and it was a ruby red glitter with very mild, faint golden shine. I wrote to the seller and they shipped me a replacement right away, which was nice.  However, the replacement was also red. They even have the stickers on them that say &amp;#34;Chunky Holo Bluebell&amp;#34;.  I wrote them again and they said it wasn&#x27;t an error. So don&#x27;t buy this expecting blue or purple.&lt;br /&gt;Wrong color aside, the nail polish is no good. Like the other reviews say, it&#x27;s a CLEAR polish with glitter in it, which would be fine, but the glitter is all of about 5 tiny pieces per brushfull. Hardly anything.  The polish is goopy and thick and takes a very long time to dry.</li>
            <li> i wore this the next day and i have gotten so many compliments ..thanks so much you guys are awesome</li>
            <li> The polish came exactly as pictured. When you get it on your nails its not as noticeable though. I suggest using it on a white polish. I do like it though! If you want a light shimmer then this is definitely it!</li>
            <li> This nail polish is almost completely clear, and has not much color or sparkle to it. If I would of paid more than 2$ for it I would of been very upset! This is a clear topcoat with a few pieces of glitter in it. Not at all like the bottle!</li>
            <li> Disappointed. You can&#x27;t see the nail color on your nails. I would of thought you would of seen more purple and shine</li>
            <li> this color was not what i expected, but nice addition to my polishes. just very thin, clear coat with some sparkles.</li>
            <li> Package arrived in time and in perfect condition.  I absolutely love the colors in this nail polish, to the point that I wish my car could be the same color :)  It&#x27;s a clear type polish with lots of different colored sparkles, looks awesome over other colors such as pink.  Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> i have to say that i absolutely love this polish....it&#x27;s so holographic it&#x27;s crazy...the smell i am not too crazy about BUT will endure it for the look.  the price is super duper great as i can&#x27;t find this in my area anywhere...i bought this to go on top of blues, purples and maybe black polish...to bring out the colors.</li>
            <li> To get that look you have to layer it over a darker color and there is no Blue, Green or Yellow in it. Orange and Pink. Disappointing</li>
            <li> So there are a lot of reviews that complain that this color doesn&#x27;t come out looking like it does in the bottle, which is true, but hear me out... At first I was disappointed, but I love this color in a whole new way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a single coat, it is very sheer, almost clear, with a very sheer subtle purpley hue. The glitter itself is clear flake style (not chunky) with a very warm opalescence to it; very orangey, pink, then green. So to use it as a single coat alone or over another color just gives you a delicate but lively shimmer, but then you can layer it up, and thats when I REALLY start to love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The more you layer it, the more depth you get in the variety of color in the sparkle. The purple base color remains sheer, even with many coats, but the color does build up and become more vivid.&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER: this polish can be a bit thick and slow to dry, especially with multiple coats, so I advise applying thin, light coats and letting it dry a bit between layers. Finishing with a fast-drying high quality top coat (like butter Hardwear, or Seche Vite) helps a LOT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite thing about this color is how easy it is to play with the layering and building the colors. You can create a very smooth ombre effect so easily, without any special tools or technique. Here&#x27;s how I create my favorite glitzy/nude/ombre style with this product:&lt;br /&gt;I start with a nude base over the whole nail, give it a minute to dry a bit, then apply one coat of this product over the whole nail. Depending on the length of your nails, the following layers are applied in tiers, leaving a single layer at the base of the nail bed, and building more and more toward the tip. So I generally follow with a 2nd coat that starts 1/3 (of the nail length) away from the nail bed brushing toward the tip. 3rd coat is from the halfway point to the tip, and then 1/4, and a lil on the very tip. Then finish with a topcoat to smooth out the surface. Because the polish is so sheer, youdont see any lines from the stepping of the layers. It just creates a beautiful nude-purple ombre that gets more sparkly toward the tip.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really into manicure looks that are kind of natural with a subtle element of color or sparkle to them, and this really fits the bill. The kind of look that doesn&#x27;t scream for attention with a bold color, but just catches the eye in an intriguing way that makes people grab by hand to demand a closer look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally found this color in a random low end beauty supply store, and am SOOO happy that I found it on Amazon. I am reordering TODAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd disclaimer: When reviewing nail polishes, durability and chipping are a big topic of discussion. I have acrylics, so all polish sticks to my nails like glue. NO CHIPPING EVER. Its that simple.</li>
            <li> smells toxic.  Looks a little sparkly.  Use as top coat.  It was really cheap, so it was worth it- maybe?</li>
            <li> It was a very sheer nail polish. Doesn&#x27;t show up with a full color under it. And certainly doesn&#x27;t show up on its own. I was quite disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all with it ,was not the colour I thought I was getting ,when it&#x27;s put in it is sticky ,I won&#x27;t be buying anymore from this site .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what this stuff is but its horrible, thick, clumpy n sticky! Will not order this stuff ever again!!</li>
            <li> so I ordered this color due to the fact it is so pretty and purple is my favorite color. I received my order today which along with tis I ordered the holo black and the set of 12 metallic. HOWEVER the color I received is NOT BLUEBELL!! It is labeled BLUEBELL but the color in the bottle is more af a pink/fuchsia color even after I applied it it was still pinky color. Kind of upset about this. the color I got though is pretty I just really want the BLUEBELL that I ordered!!!!!</li>
            <li> I just received my new polish and the color is beautiful!  I plan on buying the whole Kleancolor line, so excited!  Thanks Eau Claire for shipping quick and making this a great experience.</li>
