            <li> I&#x27;ve tried cleansing conditioners instead of shampoo and everything I&#x27;ve tried left my hair a greasy mess, so I was overjoyed that this wasn&#x27;t at all like anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great item. Made my hair so soft and shiny. AAA+++</li>
            <li> I love this product!  But I have a Brazilian Blowout and I cannot use sulfites or sodium chloride. I&#x27;m curious if this product contains either.</li>
            <li> It made me break out.</li>
            <li> Wonderful and quick products to use ! I simply use the product at the start of my shower and rise it out and my hair feels sort and clean. Would recommend it to anyone who has coloured or bleached hair</li>
            <li> Great feeling hair after treatment, last a long time.  Hair soft shiny vey manageable. My hair is is great condition since I began using this</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Even for my fine thin hair it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. Helps with the dry ends from blowing it dry and curling every day.</li>
            <li> Very nice product. A balm for the scalp.</li>
            <li> This is the worst hair product I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot (more than I care to admit). I followed the directions to a t and what did I end up with? A glossy bouncy mane? Heck no! My hair was flat and greasy while the ends were dry and frizzy. My hair had a strange, heavy coating on it that even came off on my hands when I touched it. I don&#x27;t understand how other reviewers had the great results they reported. Upset I wasted so much money on this junk.</li>
            <li> This really works.. Amazing results! Wow. I would highly recommend you try it. I haven&#x27;t tried their other products but am a firm believer in their quality.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough about JF products. Yes it&#x27;s pricey however if you consider all the products purchased that didn&#x27;t work I consider this a big save. I purchased the hydrate shampoo and conditioner if I hadto choose one this product that transformed my hair back to soft shiny healthier  younger looking hair if select restore, then the conditioner. I plan to continue purchasing JL to maintain these results to fight the aging process !</li>
            <li> Item not new.  When I opened lid, the seal marked &amp;#34;sealed for freshness&amp;#34; was loosely sitting on top of opening.  I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this once a week in place of my shampoo and conditioner and it has made my hair so soft and managable. My hair is thin and gets weighed down easily but this doesn&#x27;t weigh it down at all. I&#x27;ve tried cleansing conditioners instead of shampoo and everything I&#x27;ve tried left my hair a greasy mess, so I was overjoyed that this wasn&#x27;t at all like anything else I&#x27;ve tried.

This is definitely on the pricey side, but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s well worth the investment. You&#x27;re don&#x27;t use it every day so it should last a while.</li>
            <li> its  ok , smells nice, nut i didnt feel anything different then any other shampoo</li>
            <li> I have reordered this product at least 4 times. I love it. It makes my hair very manageable and soft. I will put it on my scalp first then let sit for 2 hours then follow directions. Once every two weeks I use regular shampoo then go back to this  only wish it weren&#x27;t so pricey and came in a larger container. Runs out quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this. It left my hair the way I like it. Body and hopefully with enough it will help the hair loss. It goes on dry hair, easy to do and just rinse off in the shower. Its great. Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My fine, thin hair looks and feels better than ever!  I get compliments about how shiny and full my hair looks.  I hope never to be without this product line!</li>
            <li> I used this in past and loved it. Not sure if my hair changed but it made my hair very oily.</li>
            <li> Restored the texture in my hair. Very happy with it!</li>
            <li> This is a great product to use for the days you are skipping washing.  I have long hair and you are supposed to put it on dry hair so that can take a lot of product and it&#x27;s not easy to do.  So I have been wetting my hair and putting it on in the shower then rinsing out.  It makes my hair so soft and healthy and it will last for two days!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful Shampoo/Conditioner.  It leaves my hair very clean and shiny.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Saw some glowing reviews of this product.  Wish concurred.  Product was not \\&quot;terrible\\&quot; - I just did not see the kind of results advertised by the company or, that some of the reviewers mentioned.  Received conflicting directions on how to use the product.  Have not seen hair retention results.  Cost vs benefits make this item something not worth getting again.</li>
            <li> I started using this product after watching a doctor on television talk about it&#x27;s benefits.  My hair was thinning due to a thyroid problem.  I started using the vitamin restore along with the shampoo and conditioner to give my hair a boost.  After getting my thyroid working and using these products my hair has returned better than before.  My hair is stronger, shiner and healthier.  Use the Vitamin Restore as recommended.  You can watch a video on JF website to get you started.</li>
            <li> This is a treatment that acts like a cowash, only this one actually gets your hair clean. The first time I tried it , I wasn&#x27;t sure. I gave it a couple of weeks, and it is fabulous. I have fine hair, and it leaves my hair fluffy and clean and with much more body.My only complaint is that I want a super-size. ;) My best results have been applying it dry and leaving it for a few hours before rinsing it out.</li>
            <li> The directions were weird, but I followed them, and my hair was transformed into a Glossy Mane for a change!  I usually need my hair to squeak when clean, and preferably some of that after I condition. I don&#x27;t remember if it did that or not, but I sure didn&#x27;t get that residue feeling I was expecting, and my hair never looked or felt better.  I say that as somebody with highlights and lowlights and I use a flatiron daily. I only use it when I&#x27;ve washed my hair the day before, not sure if it has enough cleansing power to remove 2 days&#x27; worth of atmospheric grime, but I was just thunderstruck by this product. I can&#x27;t see myself not using it from now on.</li>
            <li> Great product. Your hair feels noticeably softer and smoother after one use.</li>
            <li> This one of the best products. It makes my hair look Fuller and gives it volume. I have very fine and thinning hair&lt;br /&gt;Have tried many products this one works the best for me. First saw it on GMA with dermatologist Dr.Doris Day.&lt;br /&gt;I have the shampoo and conditioner too.</li>
            <li> I am using it every other day. Heard this product was good on TV show. So far, nice non-fragrancey feel.</li>
            <li> The Vitamin Restore makes my hair shine, shine, shine without any products who would think. This product is so easy to use once a week and really keeps my hair in top condition since I only trim twice a year. My hair feels amazing, air dries perfect no frizz and detangles effortlessly highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I used this once. What a waste. It left a nasty residue in my hair that I only felt after it dried  and I don&#x27;t blowdry so I woke up to yucky sticky hair that I had to pile into a bun and that was even hard!! It was so dry and gross. I couldn&#x27;t wait to get home that night to wash it out. What a waste of money. I want to know who is using this that has had success with it?</li>
            <li> This is good quality and I really love the way it makes my hair feel and look and this is my second bottle.</li>
            <li> Great hair product -- has done wonders for me.  Will definely order again.  Heard about it on a TV program</li>
