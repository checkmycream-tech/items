            <li>smells wonderful, daughter loves it</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m very happy with that too!</li>
            <li>The BEST soothing night cream for my rosacea skin.  </li>
            <li>Very nice night cream!</li>
            <li>It smells so good and my skin feels incredible!</li>
            <li>However when I wake up in the morning my face is beautifully moisturize and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>This cream feels great, smells good, and my skin asks for it!</li>
            <li>So I got another bottle and my face is happy again.</li>
            <li>I think it is a great night time lotion.</li>
            <li>Just what I wanted at a great price.</li>
            <li>Soothing and a great scent.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li>Amazing Product!  </li>
            <li>, I used to have to cover it in foundation to get a good even skin tone.</li>
            <li>It has a very strong cucumber smell, but it is a good lotion.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer!</li>
            <li>Love all of yes to products!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Favorite Face Cream of all time!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a nice coating for one&#x27;s face to protect from wrinkling and drying.</li>
            <li>Ive used every high end cream there is - this does the job nicely for a great value.  </li>
            <li>Just ok.  </li>
            <li>and I love that this stuff works into my skin well</li>
            <li>I LOVE the Yes</li>
            <li>To brand and have switched most of my bath and beauty products to their line</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried primer, different lotions, and foundations, and this works the best.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>I thought that i might be able to use this product until about three days after I started using it when my face broke out in a sunburn like rash</li>
            <li>She&#x27;ll be ordering more when this runs out.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>so I mostly use this as a night cream.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a safe (no parabens, etc) and somewhat inexpensive night cream.  </li>
            <li>I was worried about this cream making my face greasy, as most night cream do.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have rosacea and many products make it flare up.</li>
            <li>The cream is smooth, has a nice scent and rubs in easily.</li>
            <li>And cucumber smell is very clean.</li>
            <li>In all fairness, it is still a pretty good price.</li>
            <li>In fact it works better than creams that are easily 3 to 8 times the prices for me.</li>
            <li>I wanted a night cream that was gentle and good for my skin.  </li>
            <li>Light texture great for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s like a strong perfume-y cucumber.</li>
            <li>but I have to say that this product has a strong scent to it.</li>
            <li>It was fantastic.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a SPF free night time lotion</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been to dermatologists and they gave me a light steroid cream.  </li>
            <li>I would say at this price point, it is well worth a try,  because it may work better for you.  </li>
            <li>I like the texture and the motorizing effects but the fragrance is very powerful.</li>
            <li>Spreads easily and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It feels cool and light when you put it on.</li>
            <li>It would probably be great for someone with dry skin.</li>
            <li>just enough moisturizer to make my skin soft and supple. :D</li>
            <li>Good as a daily moisturizer for those of us with drier skin.</li>
            <li>I started using this over the winter because I get mild eczema in my cheekbone area.</li>
            <li>and that takes care of the mild greasiness of this.</li>
            <li>It goes on nice, and dries very quickly on the skin, so it does take two applications to make yoru face smooth, but I still have plenty left and have had it for two months now, and it is a reasonable price for being a pretty clean product.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite night cream, although I&#x27;ve taken to layering it under my sunscreen during the day too.</li>
            <li>so I was pretty excited to find this.</li>
            <li>Honestly the smell is the last thing that matters about this stuff.</li>
            <li>liked Dead Sea Essentials night cream much better.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if they came in larger sizes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too think and absorbs pretty quickly but still leaves your skin feeling moist.  </li>
            <li>I put this stuff on right before bed</li>
            <li>It comes in a little pump bottle which is the best because it&#x27;s usually a little more than I need for my face</li>
            <li>Works fine as a hand lotion, but doesn&#x27;t work well with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>To&#x27;s facial towelettes and plan on investing in more of</li>
            <li>After I used this for the first time, I don&#x27;t know if I will ever use another night cream again.</li>
            <li>On a side note: shouldn&#x27;t products for sensitive skin be fragrance free?</li>
            <li>I am new to the whole night cream thing, having just turned 30 last August, but in that time I have tried a bunch and after doing a lot of reading, am trying to phase out most of the chemicals in my life and replace products with more natural ones.</li>
            <li>Except this stuff is already fairly inexpensive compared to other organic and natural products, so I&#x27;m willing to pay $10</li>
            <li>I am told this product works very well and very fast.  </li>
            <li>My face, although not dry anymore, did not feel as smooth.</li>
            <li>It does have a strong cucumber scent, but I personally don&#x27;t mind it.</li>
            <li>Did not use a large amount, perhaps two pumps of it.  </li>
            <li>Smells good, i got this because I have recently had my skin become flaky and dry.</li>
            <li>And I really think it has helped with my acne.</li>
            <li>A friend recommended the yes products to me and I really like all of them.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know, I really didn&#x27;t even think about moisturizing my skin until like 3 months ago.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But this stuff really works for me.</li>
            <li>I do not like the smell of it, it does not do much for my skin</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s way to much in my opinion for a &amp;#34;calming&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>and I really noticed the difference.</li>
            <li>I tried the day time version of this with the SPF and didn&#x27;t like it as much.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product</li>
            <li>My skin feels very hydrated when I use this.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin so soft and now my skin is nice and even, it&#x27;s even cleared up some minimal acne.</li>
            <li>The smell is a little stong at first, but it isn&#x27;t overwhelming or so much you cannot put it on.</li>
            <li>I do have sensitive and difficult skin and like many others in my position, have tried oh so many products.  </li>
            <li>Because of this I don&#x27;t live and die by any brand/product.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>This night cream leaves my skin feeling very soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for those with sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just trying to make it clear</li>
            <li>and I like the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, acne-prone, combination skin.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s for sensitive skin then I wonder why they put fragrance in it to begin with.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bonus that it is mostly natural.</li>
            <li>Use it on my 7 year old daughter too.</li>
            <li>it looks like it will last me probably me quite a few more weeks.</li>
            <li>You will be able to feel it on your face, as it is rather thick, but I don&#x27;t mind that.</li>
            <li>I would only buy again if it was on sale, i think i could find something as good for a little less</li>
            <li>I bought this cream because of the high review left by another customer.  </li>
            <li>It smells great, consistency is not too thick or too thin, and it moisturizes his skin very well.</li>
            <li>As someone with sensitive skin and a light case of rosacea/sun damage this is one of the few night creams on the market that actually does calm my skin down.</li>
            <li>I have adult acne and have tried many moisturizers but they all seem to make it worse.</li>
            <li>I was having a major breakout and wanted something non-irritating.  </li>
            <li>this always makes my skin soft, and doesn&#x27;t leave it red.  </li>
            <li>I have to honestly say that I am still not impressed.  </li>
            <li>I use this at night AND day time (I&#x27;d say my face is normal to dry).</li>
            <li>After reading positive reviews on Amazon and other sites, I felt like I did not give it enough of a chance.  </li>
            <li>Not heavy enough to make my face feel gross in the morning but</li>
            <li>This is the only product that is light enough to not feel thick, greasy, or cause pimples, and still visibly calms my naturally red cheeks.  </li>
            <li>and when I put this stuff on at night, I wake up the next morning and the redness has gone down so much.</li>
            <li>I have extremely dry and extremely sensitive red reactive skin.</li>
            <li>and when she was buying some new stuff I saw this and was like \\&quot;Why not?\\&quot; I use other moisturizers for the day, but I thought maybe there was something different about night ones?</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I would give this zero stars if possible.  Used this product only two times, both times making me feel like I have been drugged.  Dizziness and tingling throughout my body started a few minutes after applying to my face and neck.  Did not use a large amount, perhaps two pumps of it.  I relate the feeling to going under anesthesia, a feeling I don&#x27;t want to experience at night.  Do not buy this!!</li>
            <li> BUYER BEWARE!!! Compare all the boxes on the shelf, cucumbers, carrots, grapefuit etc&lt;br /&gt;THEY ARE ALL THE SAME INGREDIENTS!!!!!!!! Marketing strategies by yes.</li>
            <li> Just ok.  I can never find this locally because it is always sold out.  It did not help or hurt my skin.  It stayed, dried, sensitive, red and irritated.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer! I have adult acne and have tried many moisturizers but they all seem to make it worse. This one says its for nighttime but I use it for day as well. And I really think it has helped with my acne. I think my skin becomes so dry it overproduced oil to compensate. This lotion keeps it hydrated and fewer bumps. It also doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive eyes. And cucumber smell is very clean.</li>
            <li> Love all of yes to products!</li>
            <li> A friend recommended the yes products to me and I really like all of them.  I like the smell of the product and I like the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I found this stuff at my local Target in the clearance bin for $1.54, so I bought two of them.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive/oily/red skin on my face and I love that this stuff works into my skin well (and easily).&lt;br /&gt;My skin has been less oily in the mornings when I wake up and the redness has gone down a little.  It does irritate my eyes if I accidentally get a little on my eyelids, but that is the only con I have.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, acne-prone, combination skin. This did not work well with it and tended to leave my face feeling irritated, with and without being paired with the cleanser. I also do not like the smell at all, it&#x27;s like a strong perfume-y cucumber. Not my thing. Works fine as a hand lotion, but doesn&#x27;t work well with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am new to the whole night cream thing, having just turned 30 last August, but in that time I have tried a bunch and after doing a lot of reading, am trying to phase out most of the chemicals in my life and replace products with more natural ones. I LOVE the Yes To brand and have switched most of my bath and beauty products to their line and this is no exception. The cream is smooth, has a nice scent and rubs in easily. You will be able to feel it on your face, as it is rather thick, but I don&#x27;t mind that.</li>
            <li> My roommate uses other Yes To products and when she was buying some new stuff I saw this and was like \\&quot;Why not?\\&quot; I use other moisturizers for the day, but I thought maybe there was something different about night ones? I don&#x27;t know, I really didn&#x27;t even think about moisturizing my skin until like 3 months ago. I&#x27;m just trying to make it clear I&#x27;m not an expert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this stuff really works for me. I still get some bad acne every few weeks and when I put this stuff on at night, I wake up the next morning and the redness has gone down so much. I spent one night picking at my blackheads and other acne and my face looked awful. Just raw and red and gross, like I was wondering why I even left the house when my skins like this. I put this stuff on right before bed and the next morning it looks like I haven&#x27;t had a blemish in weeks. I also have a bit of rosacea and this stuff seems to tone that down as well. A lot of people complain about the smell but either it goes away after 15 minutes or I just get used to it. Honestly the smell is the last thing that matters about this stuff. It comes in a little pump bottle which is the best because it&#x27;s usually a little more than I need for my face but then I just spread it down my neck. It is a small bottle, and I&#x27;ve only been using it for about two weeks so I&#x27;m not sure when it will run out, but looking at the amount I have left it looks like it will last me probably me quite a few more weeks. Except this stuff is already fairly inexpensive compared to other organic and natural products, so I&#x27;m willing to pay $10 every 6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use Yes To&#x27;s facial towelettes and plan on investing in more of Yes To&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> I do not like the smell of it, it does not do much for my skin either.&lt;br /&gt;I liked Dead Sea Essentials night cream much better.</li>
            <li> This night cream leaves my skin feeling very soft and hydrated. It does have a strong cucumber scent, but I personally don&#x27;t mind it. I have very dry skin on my forehead and this cream helps a lot. I like how it makes my skin feel and I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to those looking for something to help hydrate your skin.</li>
            <li> its hard having really harsh red undertones. I&#x27;ll wake up and my t-zone is just red, I used to have to cover it in foundation to get a good even skin tone. I read some reviews about this stuff evening out skin tone (I&#x27;m a yes to junkie after trying their coconut products) and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Life changing. It leaves your skin so soft and now my skin is nice and even, it&#x27;s even cleared up some minimal acne. But it, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Good as a daily moisturizer for those of us with drier skin. I use with a few drops of jojoba oil at night.</li>
            <li> I like the texture and the motorizing effects but the fragrance is very powerful. If it&#x27;s for sensitive skin then I wonder why they put fragrance in it to begin with. I can understand a bit of perfume but it&#x27;s way to much in my opinion for a &amp;#34;calming&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that is light enough to not feel thick, greasy, or cause pimples, and still visibly calms my naturally red cheeks.  I&#x27;ve tried primer, different lotions, and foundations, and this works the best.  It&#x27;s a bonus that it is mostly natural.</li>
            <li> smells wonderful, daughter loves it</li>
            <li> I started using this over the winter because I get mild eczema in my cheekbone area. I actually used this with my kids&#x27; eczema lotion (Babyganics Bye Bye Dry) because my face was so dry. Then I ran out and I was just using the eczema lotion and I really noticed the difference. My face, although not dry anymore, did not feel as smooth. So I got another bottle and my face is happy again. I use this at night AND day time (I&#x27;d say my face is normal to dry). I tried the day time version of this with the SPF and didn&#x27;t like it as much. I&#x27;d say that this cream is a little on the heavier side but after putting it on in the morning, I wait about 10-15 mins (while I get dressed for work) and then put on some powder concealer with a brush and that takes care of the mild greasiness of this. Love it!</li>
            <li> After I used this for the first time, I don&#x27;t know if I will ever use another night cream again. I woke up and my skin felt like I had just gotten a facial. It was fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a SPF free night time lotion so I was pretty excited to find this. A lot of lotion comes out with each pump. I think it is a great night time lotion.</li>
            <li> Amazing Product!  I&#x27;ve suffered from skin irritation for years!  I&#x27;ve been to dermatologists and they gave me a light steroid cream.  That worked, but over time went out it thinned out my skin and it was terrible.  I&#x27;ve tried everything and nothing worked until my Wife bought this on a whim.  Now two years later of using it I&#x27;ve never had any skin problems.  It&#x27;s unbelievable this over the counter cream works, but it does.  It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I love it. Just what I wanted at a great price.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT!! It smells so good and my skin feels incredible!</li>
            <li> LOVE Yes to Cucumbers. It&#x27;s the only moisturizer I use where it doesn&#x27;t make me break out and keeps my skin moist and radiant.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely horrible! it is not organic or safe for sensitive skin, i developed eczema under my eyes, using the cucumber under eye crap , i asked my dermatologist what was up, she said that many people have had very bad reactions from this product. #itscrap</li>
            <li> So soothing and cucumber-y. Spreads easily and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Soothing and a great scent.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry and extremely sensitive red reactive skin. I bought this at another store but I have to say that this product has a strong scent to it. I could smell it all day. I thought that i might be able to use this product until about three days after I started using it when my face broke out in a sunburn like rash and  turned tomato red. This also wasn&#x27;t as moisturizing as I need for my skin (I have psoriasis too). I really wanted to like this product but I can&#x27;t even finish the product now due to the reaction my skin had to it. On a side note: shouldn&#x27;t products for sensitive skin be fragrance free? I will not repurchase. This product may work well for skin types that are not sensitive.</li>
            <li> Not too greasy. I have had not breakouts. A little seems to go a long way. I shall be regularly repurchasing.</li>
            <li> very heavy white base-difficult for make-up to cover.</li>
            <li> Ive used every high end cream there is - this does the job nicely for a great value.  Light texture great for sensitive skin.  Use it on my 7 year old daughter too.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this cream. It smells great, consistency is not too thick or too thin, and it moisturizes his skin very well.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream because of the high review left by another customer.  I wanted a night cream that was gentle and good for my skin.  It has a very strong cucumber smell, but it is a good lotion.</li>
            <li> I am told this product works very well and very fast.  She&#x27;ll be ordering more when this runs out.  It would be nice if they came in larger sizes.</li>
            <li> In general I am indifferent to facial products as I usually don&#x27;t notice a change in my skin and they all feel quite similar to me. Because of this I don&#x27;t live and die by any brand/product. EXCEPT for this product now! I absolutely love this product. It feels cool and light when you put it on. My skin feels very hydrated when I use this. And its not overly thick if you want to use it during the day. It would probably be great for someone with dry skin. I have slightly oily/sensitive skin so when I wear it during the day I still get a bit oily so I mostly use this as a night cream. My only drawback is that it is only 1.7oz -- the size I feel is typical for serums, not creams. I like a big bang for my buck. But a little goes a long way with this product and since I like the way it feels, I&#x27;ll overlook the small bottle. In all fairness, it is still a pretty good price. And you can carry it in your bag on airplanes, which is a plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for shipping, I received it promptly so I&#x27;m very happy with that too!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a safe (no parabens, etc) and somewhat inexpensive night cream.  This one fits the bill!  I was having a major breakout and wanted something non-irritating.  It&#x27;s not too think and absorbs pretty quickly but still leaves your skin feeling moist.  I&#x27;m a big fan.</li>
            <li> Smells good, i got this because I have recently had my skin become flaky and dry. I wanted something calming and moisturizing. I would give it four stars but its a little pricey for such a small amount. I would only buy again if it was on sale, i think i could find something as good for a little less</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have tried this brand.  After reading positive reviews on Amazon and other sites, I felt like I did not give it enough of a chance.  I have to honestly say that I am still not impressed.  I do have sensitive and difficult skin and like many others in my position, have tried oh so many products.  I do like the texture and I cannot say there have been adverse effects, but also no real &amp;#34;calming&amp;#34; of my skin.  I would say at this price point, it is well worth a try,  because it may work better for you.  And if it doesn&#x27;t, there is a lot less angst about throwing money away - again- for a disappointing product.</li>
            <li> I was worried about this cream making my face greasy, as most night cream do. However when I wake up in the morning my face is beautifully moisturize and not greasy at all. I LOVE this stuff. Not heavy enough to make my face feel gross in the morning but just enough moisturizer to make my skin soft and supple. :D</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and many products make it flare up. This doesn&#x27;t and it&#x27;s a nice coating for one&#x27;s face to protect from wrinkling and drying. I already have bought it again. It&#x27;s inexpensive. It doesn&#x27;t have a smell which I like also.</li>
            <li> Favorite Face Cream of all time!  This cream feels great, smells good, and my skin asks for it!</li>
            <li> Very nice night cream! The smell is a little stong at first, but it isn&#x27;t overwhelming or so much you cannot put it on. It goes on nice, and dries very quickly on the skin, so it does take two applications to make yoru face smooth, but I still have plenty left and have had it for two months now, and it is a reasonable price for being a pretty clean product. Plus, it has reduce the redness in my face.</li>
            <li> this always makes my skin soft, and doesn&#x27;t leave it red.  I highly recommend for those with sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite night cream, although I&#x27;ve taken to layering it under my sunscreen during the day too. As someone with sensitive skin and a light case of rosacea/sun damage this is one of the few night creams on the market that actually does calm my skin down. In fact it works better than creams that are easily 3 to 8 times the prices for me. Now I just have to pray they don&#x27;t discontinue it.</li>
            <li> The BEST soothing night cream for my rosacea skin.  A+</li>
