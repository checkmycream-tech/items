            <li>Nice feeling bristles, they are almost addicting.</li>
            <li>but there are so many to make it feel nice.</li>
            <li>favorite toothbrush for years now</li>
            <li>I started using this style and brand of toothbrush about six months ago, and I love it.</li>
            <li>I was able to remove it and felt better.  </li>
            <li>Love these I feel like I&#x27;m glossing as well as brushing my teeth</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It feels great, stays clean and lasts really long.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This stronger material this brush uses makes it more durable &amp; enables ultra fine bristles that enable deeper cleaning at the gum line which is important.  </li>

            <li>They cost a bit more but are worth it.</li>
            <li>As plaque causes gum recession &amp; can cause gum disease &amp;/or cavities &amp; even impacts one&#x27;s health, it&#x27;s well worth making sure</li>

            <li>but, if you go light they are great.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Great product- 2nd time I ordered.  </li>
            <li>These are great brushes, the bristles have super thin ends and work great to get in between the teeth.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean after using these.  </li>
            <li>Cleaning: 9/10 ... Stays Clean:</li>
            <li>INITIALLY INCREASED SENSITIVITY/SORENESS COULD BE A GOOD SIGN</li>
            <li>The company seems very thorough &amp; responsive so I would imagine they would be pleased to issue a replacement or help figure out what might be causing any problem as the way I found their email address is a company rep included it in her reply to somebody who had problems with another brush of theirs.toms rapidly worsen until I figure out &amp; stop whatever&#x27;s causing the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>yes from my microbiology and chemistry knowledge I can say it would keep a brush from harboring more bacteria than normal.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what tooth brushes should be like!</li>
            <li>They never smell or taste funny!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because of my concerns, Mouth Watchers was kind enough to send me a free brush to try out &amp; I WAS SO VERY GRATEFUL TO DISCOVER THIS IDEAL BRUSH TO ALTERNATE WITH MY OTHER #1 BRUSH (the SoFresh flossing brush)</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush - once you use it you do not want to use an ordinary toothbrush again</li>
            <li>have a great solid feel to them when you push and the smaller bristles stay intact and don&#x27;t bend.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>As that cleaning was extra rough to go through, it motivated me to make sure I use the most effective brushes possible while staying soft &amp; gentle as my dentist explained it&#x27;s repeated micro-rotations that result in effective cleaning &amp; not the pressure which is why they&#x27;re always urging we stay with soft brushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only do my teeth feel cleaner, but at my regular dental cleaning this week, my hygienist told me that I must floss more than most people.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even explain exactly why</li>
            <li>I emailed the company (info@mouthwatchers.com) &amp; they were very helpful including in explaining their extensive testing &amp; that they only chose to use PBT as the material because its strength enables the ultra-fine bristles to stay strong &amp; durable so as to enable effective deep cleaning.  </li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is the price, just a lot more than any other regular toothbrushes, but I guess worth it for the best.</li>
            <li>EACH UNIQUELY DESIGNED TO BRING EXTRA BENEFITS</li>
            <li>It does clean places that have never been cleaned before, however i had soar gums the next morning</li>
            <li>They deep clean</li>
            <li>have used expensive 5-6 dollar Oral B and Crest brushes for years.&lt;br /&gt;After trying these I had to grab more, these are the legit ones; all is safe to order from Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and they put nano silver on them to help kill germs unlike a normal toothbrush from Crest or Colgate.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like a lot of the new toothbrushes that utilize &amp;#34;plastic&amp;#34; in place of bristles.  </li>
            <li>SO I COULD MAKE SURE THAT the various problems some other reviewers mentioned including with bristles falling out were not an issue.  </li>
            <li>SO I COULD MAKE SURE THAT the various problems some other reviewers mentioned including with bristles falling out were not an issue.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe this isn&#x27;t more well known and the standard at which all other toothbrushes are measured!</li>
            <li>That is why it can initially seem to aggravate sensitivity or create some soreness but that should go away within a week or so as it&#x27;s simply that any area that was previously covered by plaque will be more sensitive when first exposed but should rapidly adjust.  </li>

            <li>I have given these to two different people who both also really like them.</li>
            <li>They are correct in that the downside I discovered after a few months of using the Nimbus brush which looks similar in design is that the challenge for very fine &amp; soft bristles is how to enable enough cleaning power.  </li>
            <li>As those were the first group of chemicals I was told essential to avoid given my specific chemical sensitivities &amp; I</li>
            <li>I had no idea that a lot more plaque than usual was accumulating during this time till my hygienist asked me what I had been doing differently.  </li>
            <li>The brushes save some time flossing and keep teeth cleaner than a normal bush with larger bristles.  </li>
            <li>NOW USING THIS MOUTHWATCHERS BRUSH DAILY as I&#x27;m so sensitive that I can rapidly tell if I&#x27;m being exposed to anything harmful vs. beneficial as my symptoms rapidly worsen until I figure out &amp; stop whatever&#x27;s causing the problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Soft on the top, hard if you push down.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s almost painful at first, like a really deep flossing</li>
            <li> always use soft tooth brushes, these are a little hard if you PUSH real hard</li>
            <li> rapidly feel awful when I use products containing it even in minor doses or when I don&#x27;t know I&#x27;m being exposed, the idea of putting anything in my mouth that could contain it seemed very scary.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Amazing tooth brushes!  They cost a bit more but are worth it.</li>

            <li> Great toothbrush - once you use it you do not want to use an ordinary toothbrush again</li>
            <li> I like how these are recycled plastic and they put nano silver on them to help kill germs unlike a normal toothbrush from Crest or Colgate.  All toothbrushes should have nano silver on them.</li>
            <li> The best toothbrush I have ever used. Nice feeling bristles, they are almost addicting. Makes you want to brush longer. You feel like you are really cleaning your teeth since each bristly is thin to reach all the spots but there are so many to make it feel nice. The only complaint I have is the price, just a lot more than any other regular toothbrushes, but I guess worth it for the best.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean after using these.  I don&#x27;t like a lot of the new toothbrushes that utilize &amp;#34;plastic&amp;#34; in place of bristles.  These are great.</li>
            <li> Wife loves this brand..</li>

            <li> I started using this style and brand of toothbrush about six months ago, and I love it. Not only do my teeth feel cleaner, but at my regular dental cleaning this week, my hygienist told me that I must floss more than most people. Actually now I don&#x27;t floss that often, because I don&#x27;t feel I need to. I have given these to two different people who both also really like them.</li>
            <li> These are great brushes, the bristles have super thin ends and work great to get in between the teeth.  The company website  explains the antibacterial material and the composition.  The brushes save some time flossing and keep teeth cleaner than a normal bush with larger bristles.  Very happy with the purchase and recommend.</li>
            <li> It does clean places that have never been cleaned before, however i had soar gums the next morning and i saw that one of the bristles had gotten lodged in between my tooth and the gum.  I was able to remove it and felt better.  I will not be using this because i dont want to have to worry every time i brush my teeth of bristles getting lodged between my tooth and gum.</li>
            <li> We have used a few different silver toothbrushes.  These are nano sliver in the bristles themselves.</li>
            <li> These do seem to clean my teeth better</li>
            <li> Hairs/Bristles: 9.5/10 ... Ergonomic: 8/10  ... Longevity: 10/10 ... Cleaning: 9/10 ... Stays Clean: 10/10&lt;br /&gt;Over all I love this toothbrush! It feels great, stays clean and lasts really long.&lt;br /&gt;I actually got this from my dentist months ago and used it for over 5 months!!!&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the nano silver is a great idea.  The idea is when you make a surface have silver, copper or nickle, it will limit/kill bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;And yes from my microbiology and chemistry knowledge I can say it would keep a brush from harboring more bacteria than normal.  BUT! I do not know the quantity of silver per mm^3 on this brush or know how long it will stay on there after 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;It would be a great experiment you could do in any microbiology class! I would like to know myself!&lt;br /&gt;They have a great solid feel to them when you push and the smaller bristles stay intact and don&#x27;t bend.&lt;br /&gt;I have used expensive 5-6 dollar Oral B and Crest brushes for years.&lt;br /&gt;After trying these I had to grab more, these are the legit ones; all is safe to order from Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;I always use soft tooth brushes, these are a little hard if you PUSH real hard but, if you go light they are great.&lt;br /&gt;The best way to express this is like a pillow top spring bed.  Soft on the top, hard if you push down. Exactly what tooth brushes should be like!</li>
            <li> Love these I feel like I&#x27;m glossing as well as brushing my teeth they et in every nook and cranny of your teetg</li>
            <li> the best toothbrush ever</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews often but this is something people should know about. This is a great toothbrush. I can&#x27;t even explain exactly why but my teeth feel more clean than ever and it also is amazing for the gums. It&#x27;s almost painful at first, like a really deep flossing but I love it. I can&#x27;t believe this isn&#x27;t more well known and the standard at which all other toothbrushes are measured!</li>
            <li> Really good toothbrush. I&#x27;m not a dentist, but I&#x27;d recommend it to other people.</li>
            <li> Great product- 2nd time I ordered.  I love the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love these toothbrushes!!! They deep clean so well it feels like a flossed. They never smell or taste funny!</li>
