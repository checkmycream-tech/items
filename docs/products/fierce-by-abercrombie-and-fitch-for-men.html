            <li>Simply awesome.</li>
            <li>It is excellent for fall/winter and will work for any</li>
            <li>Keep trying to perfect it.</li>
            <li>very good longevity and superb projection.</li>
            <li>Muy buen producto y entrega a tiempo , lo recomiendo , calidad y servicio , very good, excelente . .</li>
            <li>Happy when it returned.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great and has been around way before A&amp;F carried the label.</li>
            <li>great</li>
            <li>On a sidebar - she kept her nose close to my neck most of the night..!!  </li>
            <li>Nice and mellow, not slap you in the face!</li>
            <li>What a good decision.</li>
            <li>When I was in college, I loved this smell on boys of all types.</li>
            <li>I recieved the cologne in the mail and it is good stuff.</li>
            <li>With that in mind,  I thought what better way to suprise him than to give him Abercrombie&#x27;s best and most famous cologne ever!</li>
            <li>Very excited!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still smells nice though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s especially good for young guys.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s VERY  sexy and a HUGE turn on for every woman I&#x27;ve ever heard talk about it.</li>
            <li>Woods is a great musky/&#x27;woodsy&#x27; fragrance - If the price/value were better, perhaps my scoring would be higher.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and great packaging.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You will love it.</li>
            <li>It remains one of my all-time favorites, as it is a truly perfect male cologne.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, Woods also happens to smell extremely sexy.</li>
            <li>I will  be purchasing him a bottle of Abercrombie Woods FOR SURE for Father&#x27;s Day.</li>
            <li>If this were the only cologne my husband wore for the rest of his life, I would be very happy.  </li>
            <li>For those of you who love those musky, spicy, and outdoors (&#x27;woodsy&#x27;) notes, this cologne is for you.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>but I was able to obtain througn Amazn.com.</li>
            <li>I miss it very much as do many of my friends.</li>
            <li>The only thing \\&quot;Fierce\\&quot; about it is that it probably an excellent insect repellant.</li>
            <li>it is his favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li>So, be sure when you order</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s refined, distinctive and very unique.</li>
            <li>A very good cologne, I&#x27;m glad A&amp;F brought it back after a couple year hiatus.</li>
            <li>I liked the fragrance and that i got it in the right time!!!&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>To my nose, the new Woods smells just as good as the original.</li>
            <li>, I can only highly recommend Woods to anyone who appreciates a fine smelling cologne, one that stands out from the crowd and will make you feel wonderful!!</li>
            <li>I have the original fragrance</li>
            <li>musky/&#x27;woodsy&#x27; fragrance - If the price/value were better, perhaps my scoring would be higher.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll be a great new addition to my brother&#x27;s  new image and wardrobe.</li>
            <li>will use it for special occasions.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>Other  than Armani Code and Calvin Klein&#x27;s Obsession, I&#x27;ve never found a cologne I liked better than this one.</li>
            <li>This is the 2nd time we have ordered it from Amazon and have been very pleased.  </li>
            <li>This product was exactly what I was looking for...something that I didn&#x27;t think would be available any longer.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle design is simple yet classic and Abercrombie does a great job with packaging (and marketing).  </li>
            <li>price was a bit on the higher side but since it was a gift and the recipient was incredibly excited, it made it worth it.</li>
            <li>This cologne reminds me of a fall evening, fresh out of the shower and off for a stroll with your gal.</li>
            <li>But even if you can&#x27;t stand their clothing or \\&quot;image\\&quot;, this cologne purchase is sooooooo worth it.</li>
            <li>This is a very good cologne, but I was not aware of the many different types of Abercrombie &amp; Fitch colognes when I ordered this particular one (woods).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so warm, masculine, classy and truly \\&quot;woodie\\&quot;......fir and balsam and rain and countryside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was the first time Sweetie has experienced Woods and while not initially impressed, she grew more fond of it as the day progressed.  </li>
            <li>He began wearing it when Abercrombie and Fitch first came out with it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing woods for over a 14 years, and I&#x27;m SO glad that it came back</li>
            <li>Grandchildren have many questions about the naked man on the front of a bottle.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t laugh - with a sizable collection, I don&#x27;t use it as much, but I can&#x27;t part with it.  </li>
            <li>As you&#x27;re here researching this fragrance, here is a positive review of this gem!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would ask, further if anyone knows why Woods, an undoubtedly popular and major seller at A&amp;F, just disappeared forever.</li>
            <li>You really can tell this is made with quality ingredients.</li>
            <li>And it was 100% real.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This stuff really turned heads before A&amp;F got it</li>
            <li>You would think that something like that could be made with the same precise formula and reproduced for today&#x27;s buyer&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>They brought back this cheap knock off which has about 1/10th the olfactory potency.</li>
            <li>What is the old saying, \\&quot;if it isn&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it\\&quot;...!!!</li>
            <li>The reason is simple - it is still unique among fragrances and still get&#x27;s compliments...</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak of the longevity for the relaunch, but the original Woods lasts for hours and scores well above average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Cologne is hard to find, so I was very pleased to find it here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually surprised this is marketed to a younger crowd, as it&#x27;s so opposite of popular younger aquatic scents.</li>
            <li>This is the new version of the \\&quot;old\\&quot; A&amp;F Woods.</li>
            <li>Whoever designed the new bottle should be sacked.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m taking him shopping soon for his 26th birthday  to shop for new clothes at Abercrombie &amp; Fitch.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be throwing the new one away but will use Fierce from A&amp;F for formal occasions.</li>
            <li>I would say that in the original bottle, I have, all the combined elements blend into one distinctive scent but in the new order, I can detect several different fragrance essences&#x27; and as a whole they are far removed from the old Woods, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>He loves the scent, as do I, and it is very masculine.</li>
            <li>it happens a lot: I have received only positive comments from females on this cologne (from my grandma to girlfriends).</li>
            <li>Even if you cannot find the original, from what I read about the new relaunch, it is still the same fragrance with minimal difference from some time ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a classy, gentleman&#x27;s cologne, indicative of days gone by.</li>
            <li>What hetero male wants to look at a guys abdomen every time you spray?</li>
            <li>It does not look classy or masculine.</li>
            <li>, I have had this bottle nearly 15 years.  </li>
            <li>However, after testing the various ones inside a store, I found the flavor that I really wanted, but I couldn&#x27;t afford it because I had already purchased Woods.  </li>
            <li>I knew the old Woods cologne.</li>
            <li>I have an old bottle of the Abercrombie and Fitch Woods and I can spray a bit of that and a bit of the new product and they are very different.</li>
            <li>Then the geniouses at A&amp;F discontinued it, and we were left to live off the remnants at the bottom of our bottles for years.</li>
            <li>Probably catering to a younger crowd, I have no problem wearing it (or buying a new bottle).  </li>
            <li>The Wow Factor is there - It has potential..!!  </li>
            <li>Not exactly free, but well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It used to be sold only in victory secrets (early 1990&#x27;s)and was about the only mens product in the store....</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s tired of  the sporty look and wants to go a little more chic for the ladies, without being too preppy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried/owned many different colognes (from cheap crap to hard 80&#x27;s powerhouses to modern aquatics to overly-expensive French frags), and I&#x27;ve never smelled a cologne like this.</li>

            <li> However I, an old lady, am not pleased with the new picture on the front of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I do however loathe the new packaging, why would a man want a picture of another man, half naked, on his cologne?</li>
            <li> I am very critical in Department Store signature fragrances - they can be over priced with below average longevity, especially if purchased in the store.  </li>
            <li> If you can find Woods on sale, or through other means, for around $25.00 - I definitely recommend picking it up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My fault for knowing abercrombie stopped making this product awhile ago, but just in case anyone is interested it is not the same cologne, smells weird.</li>
            <li> Well, the bottle itself looks OK even, it&#x27;s just the picture that&#x27;s bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tacky and crude, but, given the fact that many recognize me by this scent, I suppose I would buy it even if there were pictures of retching drunkards.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I agree with the other reviewer (Wolf) about the packaging.</li>
            <li> And if you believe the packaging, the cologne is designed to attract other men.</li>
            <li> This cologne isn&#x27;t very complex; the drydown is almost the same as what you initially smell upon application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only complaint about Woods is the price or value.  </li>
            <li> Abersnobie is a store that caters towards naive kids, plain and simple.</li>
            <li> Just like me when I have to look at the packaging of some douchebag holding in gas, which makes his abs abnormally tight.</li>
            <li> I was actually a little ashamed to give my boyfriend the bottle!</li>
            <li> Actually, I don&#x27;t know about the product because it ended up the wrong cologne.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why they&#x27;re dragging their feet on this.</li>

            <li> This Cologne is hard to find, so I was very pleased to find it here on Amazon.  Fast shipping and great packaging.&lt;br /&gt;The price was a bit on the higher side but since it was a gift and the recipient was incredibly excited, it made it worth it.</li>
            <li> Actually, I don&#x27;t know about the product because it ended up the wrong cologne.  But Abercrombie &amp; Fitch won&#x27;t return the product.  I realize it isn&#x27;t their fault, but the product has not been open, I have tried 3 times to return and no response, so I won&#x27;t be doing business with Abercrombie again.</li>
            <li> This is the new version of the \\&quot;old\\&quot; A&amp;F Woods. Simply awesome. Try it for yourself. You will love it.</li>
            <li> A very good cologne, I&#x27;m glad A&amp;F brought it back after a couple year hiatus. Whoever designed the new bottle should be sacked.    They still need to bring back the Woods Aftershave.  I&#x27;m not sure why they&#x27;re dragging their feet on this.</li>
            <li> My fault for knowing abercrombie stopped making this product awhile ago, but just in case anyone is interested it is not the same cologne, smells weird. Definitely a knock off.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne for my son for his birthday.  He began wearing it when Abercrombie and Fitch first came out with it.  He loves the scent, as do I, and it is very masculine.</li>
            <li> I used this cologne years ago.  Happy when it returned.  Now I am sad it is gone again.&lt;br /&gt;I will use it for special occasions.&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I ever purchased at Abercrombie and Fitch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing woods for over a 14 years, and I&#x27;m SO glad that it came back \\&quot;officially.\\&quot; I still had some stock piled, but it wouldn&#x27;t last forever. I do however loathe the new packaging, why would a man want a picture of another man, half naked, on his cologne? It&#x27;s tacky and crude, but, given the fact that many recognize me by this scent, I suppose I would buy it even if there were pictures of retching drunkards.</li>
            <li> Do not buy it from this company!!! The last cologne that I had it was mix with water!!! So, becareful!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m reading a lot of negative reviews of Woods on here, and am quite shocked by that. As you&#x27;re here researching this fragrance, here is a positive review of this gem!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Woods was a standout scent in the mid-late 1990&#x27;s with college age and 20-something males. Then the geniouses at A&amp;F discontinued it, and we were left to live off the remnants at the bottom of our bottles for years. Then about 2 years ago they brought it back. What a good decision. To my nose, the new Woods smells just as good as the original. No changes have occurred to make me notice. It remains one of my all-time favorites, as it is a truly perfect male cologne. Woods has plenty of just that, woods! It also has a bit of pepper, sandalwood and musk, and even a hint of floral in there. This cologne isn&#x27;t very complex; the drydown is almost the same as what you initially smell upon application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Woods lasts and lasts......very good longevity and superb projection. You really can tell this is made with quality ingredients. This is a classy, gentleman&#x27;s cologne, indicative of days gone by. I&#x27;m actually surprised this is marketed to a younger crowd, as it&#x27;s so opposite of popular younger aquatic scents. This cologne reminds me of a fall evening, fresh out of the shower and off for a stroll with your gal. It&#x27;s refined, distinctive and very unique. I&#x27;ve tried/owned many different colognes (from cheap crap to hard 80&#x27;s powerhouses to modern aquatics to overly-expensive French frags), and I&#x27;ve never smelled a cologne like this. It&#x27;s so warm, masculine, classy and truly \\&quot;woodie\\&quot;......fir and balsam and rain and countryside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, Woods also happens to smell extremely sexy. It&#x27;s cliche to say, but it&#x27;s called cliche becuase it happens a lot: I have received only positive comments from females on this cologne (from my grandma to girlfriends). Yes, the bottle is now stupid. We all know that. What hetero male wants to look at a guys abdomen every time you spray? But who cares?! The liquid inside is what counts. And no, don&#x27;t parrallel this cologne to it&#x27;s maker. Abersnobie is a store that caters towards naive kids, plain and simple. And I can say that, because I used to shop there. But SOMEHOW, they got this cologne spot on, and one has to give them respect for that. But even if you can&#x27;t stand their clothing or \\&quot;image\\&quot;, this cologne purchase is sooooooo worth it. I bought some from Amazon (3.4 oz or so) for 50 bucks. Not exactly free, but well worth the money. And it was 100% real. None of this \\&quot;fake\\&quot; stuff. Amazon knows what they&#x27;re doing. If you doubt it, buy it off A&amp;F&#x27;s website. It&#x27;s about the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I can only highly recommend Woods to anyone who appreciates a fine smelling cologne, one that stands out from the crowd and will make you feel wonderful!!</li>
            <li> When I was in college, I loved this smell on boys of all types. The scent was discontinued and I was disappointed. Now it&#x27;s back and seems to be the same formula. I bought it for my boyfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I agree with the other reviewer (Wolf) about the packaging. It has an ugly picture of some guy&#x27;s abs on it. It does not look classy or masculine. I was actually a little ashamed to give my boyfriend the bottle! Well, the bottle itself looks OK even, it&#x27;s just the picture that&#x27;s bad. You can&#x27;t peel off the pic though, I tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still smells nice though. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s especially good for young guys.</li>
            <li> My younger brother Justin has decided to change his image. I&#x27;m taking him shopping soon for his 26th birthday  to shop for new clothes at Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. He&#x27;s been wearing Nike and DC Shoes for awhile. He&#x27;s tired of  the sporty look and wants to go a little more chic for the ladies, without being too preppy. With that in mind,  I thought what better way to suprise him than to give him Abercrombie&#x27;s best and most famous cologne ever! Other  than Armani Code and Calvin Klein&#x27;s Obsession, I&#x27;ve never found a cologne I liked better than this one. It&#x27;s VERY  sexy and a HUGE turn on for every woman I&#x27;ve ever heard talk about it. It&#x27;ll be a great new addition to my brother&#x27;s  new image and wardrobe. My husband is now using Bath &amp; Body Works Twlight Woods, but it pales in comparison. I will  be purchasing him a bottle of Abercrombie Woods FOR SURE for Father&#x27;s Day. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great and has been around way before A&amp;F carried the label. It used to be sold only in victory secrets (early 1990&#x27;s)and was about the only mens product in the store.... This stuff really turned heads before A&amp;F got it and everyone knew what the scent was.</li>
            <li> If this were the only cologne my husband wore for the rest of his life, I would be very happy.  It doesn&#x27;t set off my migraines and it smells heavenly!  Thank you A &amp; F for bringing it back out!</li>
            <li> My husband has worn Woods Cologne for 24 years.  We were very disappointed when he ran out,and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch stores no longer carried it.  I found it on Amazon.com.  This is the 2nd time we have ordered it from Amazon and have been very pleased.  However I, an old lady, am not pleased with the new picture on the front of the bottle.  Grandchildren have many questions about the naked man on the front of a bottle.  But, for the scent I will buy it.</li>
            <li> What is the old saying, \\&quot;if it isn&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it\\&quot;...!!! I see that Abercrombie has relaunched the Woods fragrance.  I have the original fragrance and I am almost embarrassed to say, I have had this bottle nearly 15 years.  Don&#x27;t laugh - with a sizable collection, I don&#x27;t use it as much, but I can&#x27;t part with it.  The reason is simple - it is still unique among fragrances and still get&#x27;s compliments... For those of you who love those musky, spicy, and outdoors (&#x27;woodsy&#x27;) notes, this cologne is for you.  Even if you cannot find the original, from what I read about the new relaunch, it is still the same fragrance with minimal difference from some time ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle design is simple yet classic and Abercrombie does a great job with packaging (and marketing).  Probably catering to a younger crowd, I have no problem wearing it (or buying a new bottle).  It is excellent for fall/winter and will work for any occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, Woods is ripe for compliments.  I may wear this cologne twice a year now, but I still receive compliments.  This was the first time Sweetie has experienced Woods and while not initially impressed, she grew more fond of it as the day progressed.  On a sidebar - she kept her nose close to my neck most of the night..!!  :) (don&#x27;t mention that I wrote that should you know or meet her..) The Wow Factor is there - It has potential..!!  I can&#x27;t speak of the longevity for the relaunch, but the original Woods lasts for hours and scores well above average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about Woods is the price or value.  I am very critical in Department Store signature fragrances - they can be over priced with below average longevity, especially if purchased in the store.  In prior reviews, I have been critical of the value of Hollister fragrances.  If you can find Woods on sale, or through other means, for around $25.00 - I definitely recommend picking it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final scoring for Woods 4.2 stars out of 5.  Woods is a great musky/&#x27;woodsy&#x27; fragrance - If the price/value were better, perhaps my scoring would be higher. Play like a champion today...great musky/&#x27;woodsy&#x27; fragrance - If the price/value were better, perhaps my scoring would be higher. Play like a champion today...</li>
            <li> I recieved the cologne in the mail and it is good stuff. This Product is not being made anymore but I was able to obtain througn Amazn.com.</li>
            <li> I have an old bottle of the Abercrombie and Fitch Woods and I can spray a bit of that and a bit of the new product and they are very different. I would say that in the original bottle, I have, all the combined elements blend into one distinctive scent but in the new order, I can detect several different fragrance essences&#x27; and as a whole they are far removed from the old Woods, in my opinion. I would ask, further if anyone knows why Woods, an undoubtedly popular and major seller at A&amp;F, just disappeared forever. You would think that something like that could be made with the same precise formula and reproduced for today&#x27;s buyer&#x27;s. Plaudits to whoever is attempting to bring Woods back on the market. Keep trying to perfect it. I miss it very much as do many of my friends. I won&#x27;t be throwing the new one away but will use Fierce from A&amp;F for formal occasions.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for decades! Nice and mellow, not slap you in the face!</li>
            <li> I liked the fragrance and that i got it in the right time!!!&lt;br /&gt;Very&lt;br /&gt;Nice&lt;br /&gt;Product&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> This is the same nauseating scent that hits you when you walk into any Aberchrombie &amp; Fitch retail outlet. To keep things succinct, the smell is sickening. The only thing \\&quot;Fierce\\&quot; about it is that it probably an excellent insect repellant. And rest be assured, that is not the only thing it will be repelling.</li>
            <li> My Grandson loves his Wood by Abercrombie&amp;Fitch!  it is his favorite fragrance. I would definitely order this again for him.</li>
            <li> This is a very good cologne, but I was not aware of the many different types of Abercrombie &amp; Fitch colognes when I ordered this particular one (woods).  However, after testing the various ones inside a store, I found the flavor that I really wanted, but I couldn&#x27;t afford it because I had already purchased Woods.  So, be sure when you order, you know which type you want...</li>
            <li> I knew the old Woods cologne. The one that they discontinued. They brought back this cheap knock off which has about 1/10th the olfactory potency. Yes, it&#x27;s olfactorily impotent. Just like me when I have to look at the packaging of some douchebag holding in gas, which makes his abs abnormally tight. For the price they&#x27;re charging on this, it&#x27;s nuts. Don&#x27;t be fooled. The only one who can smell this scent after you put it on will be a bloodhound. And if you believe the packaging, the cologne is designed to attract other men.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I was looking for...something that I didn&#x27;t think would be available any longer.  Very excited!</li>
            <li> Muy buen producto y entrega a tiempo , lo recomiendo , calidad y servicio , very good, excelente . .</li>
            <li> This is a man&#x27;s cologne!  But why was it discontinued?  It is my rotation of fragrances and use it weekly.</li>
