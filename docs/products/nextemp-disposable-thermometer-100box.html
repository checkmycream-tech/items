            <li>they make the perfect solution to an otherwise baffling problem.</li>
            <li>The idea is great</li>
            <li>They are great for underarm temps and oral.</li>
            <li>The NexTemp disposable thermometers have always been a great product.  </li>
            <li>(we blew through 5 testing them) and ultimately a good value for the price.</li>
            <li>If you have good eyesight this might be a non-issue for you.</li>
            <li>These are great disposable thermometers, accurate to fractions of a degree.  </li>
            <li>I have kids around all the time, so this will be handy.</li>
            <li>, how many times to do you need to use a thermometer?).</li>
            <li>I love these thermometers.  </li>
            <li>however I have tried many and they do not seem to work.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you check the expiration date.  </li>
            <li>I love these disposable thermometers.</li>
            <li>Great idea - and cost is reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Cheaper than electronic thermometers and more user friendly.</li>
            <li>Easily stored, disposable means of taking temperature if fever is suspected.  </li>
            <li>Easy to read, and results are retained on the strip making comparisons easy.</li>
            <li>I prefer these because they are disposable and thus more sanitary, as well as not requiring a battery or special care.  </li>
            <li>I was feeling fine</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m an avid backpacker and Boy Scout Scoutmaster, they are perfect for my field medical bag.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Reliable and easy and clean  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re painles and kid friendly.  </li>
            <li>Easy to read, seem to be pretty darn accurate</li>
            <li>Well, that&#x27;s true for any thermometer</li>
            <li>I have used these several times, and they appear to give a good temperature reading.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was quick as and described.</li>
            <li>I have used these same ones repeatedly with accurate results for many years, so you do not need to dispose of them after one use.  </li>
            <li>Much better than a traditional thermometer!</li>
            <li>The problem, they could not withstand storage in my first aid kit or my car.</li>
            <li>These things work reasonably well and they are convenient in first aid kits.</li>
            <li>thing I would caution, avoid ordering these in the summer when the temperature gets higher than 98.6 as you will probably end up with a whole package of unusable items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John</li>
            <li>&#x27;cuz really</li>
            <li>However, like some of the other reviewers, when I received my box of disposable thermometers, many of them had already been activated, and were no longer usable.  </li>
            <li>so should have had a normal temperature.  </li>
            <li>I tested the results of these 7 year old heavily coated cardboard-type thermometers against the results of a regular mercury glass oral thermometer result and the results were the same, so they retain their accuracy over many, many uses.  </li>
            <li>Most professionals and first responders don&#x27;t use them simply because of the low price digital thermometers.  </li>
            <li>like the thermometers for a cheap not exact check</li>
            <li>I love these little things!.</li>
            <li>I got these for first aid kits and the box contains the instructions but the individual packages do not.  </li>
            <li>These thermometers are very neat and come conveniently individually wrapped.</li>
            <li>My old trusty glass mercury thermometer broke on me had to find a replacement.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They can be used either under the tongue or in the armpit with equally good results without danger of the patient biting the thermometer or when unable to use orally.  </li>
            <li>I had two new ones left with me for my use in 2007.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, they have never been popular enough to lower the significantly high price.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Ordered a these after reading reviews, use them just like a regular thermometer, one use per.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t have to worry about the battery being dead (always happens on those cheap digital thermometer&#x27;s).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When you feel feverish, and it&#x27;s night time and the light is a little dimmer, and you feel pretty crummy, you&#x27;ll have a devil of a time reading the tiny little dots to try to figure out what the heck your temperature is.</li>
            <li>After showing the exact temperature, the dots return to unused state after a few seconds.  </li>
            <li>You are suppose to look at the black dots to see the reading but the black and the dark green are too close in color to determine a good reading.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Easily stored, disposable means of taking temperature if fever is suspected.  School-aged children seem to mind this far less because of the size.  They are also eager to read the results.</li>
            <li> These thermometers are very neat and come conveniently individually wrapped. The accuracy is stated on the box as +- 0.2 degrees Fahrenheit which seems to be correct but only if placed in the proper position in the mouth. Well, that&#x27;s true for any thermometer but somehow it seems to be much more difficult to assure correct placement in the mouth (despite the picture on the box) using these thermometers compared to traditional glass ones. If I need to use a glass thermometer after each time I suspect the measurement with NexTemp is off, there is little use in using it in the first place (at least not on other family members).</li>
            <li> Inconvenient and inaccurate. 1980s technology. I would sooner have s fortune teller tell me my temperature than these thermometers.</li>
            <li> I felt a little indulgent buying disposable thermometers - but the doctors office always uses them and I&#x27;m constantly running out of batteries or getting digital errors with all of the other thermometers I&#x27;ve purchased. They&#x27;re painles and kid friendly.  Turns out I actually like these! Easy to read, seem to be pretty darn accurate (we blew through 5 testing them) and ultimately a good value for the price. I will buy again, but hopefully not too soon (&#x27;cuz really, how many times to do you need to use a thermometer?).</li>
            <li> We tried several of these in a row.  They all gave different reading over a three degree range.  I was feeling fine so should have had a normal temperature.  But we got readings from a degree and a half low to two degrees of fever.  That just isn&#x27;t acceptable.</li>
            <li> These things work reasonably well and they are convenient in first aid kits. They&#x27;re unbreakable and they can&#x27;t read too high (unless you leave them in your black car in the summer). They are single-use disposable, so there is no possibility of germ transfer. Their battery never goes dead. And they are bite-proof and don&#x27;t require poking something in an ear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using them to end all discussions with our pediatrician, who always hems and hasw when you tell her what thermometer you used. Their practice uses these (or the equivalent 3M TempaDOTs), so that ends the discussion. For me, these are easier to read than the TempaDOTs.</li>
            <li> I loves this product. The shipping was quick as and described. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for this item.</li>
            <li> Much better than a traditional thermometer!</li>
            <li> I love these little things!. I had ordered another brand&#x27;s similar item; however, that brand used small wax dots that melted to indicate a given temperature. The problem, they could not withstand storage in my first aid kit or my car. Thankfully, these are very different. I have played around with a couple of them and discovered that they &amp;#34;reset&amp;#34; after each use. That is to say that if exposed to a high temperature, like in a car, they retain their usability after they have cooled back down. Technically, they are reusable.</li>
            <li> I love these thermometers.  Hospice used these on my terminally ill husband. They can be used either under the tongue or in the armpit with equally good results without danger of the patient biting the thermometer or when unable to use orally.  I had two new ones left with me for my use in 2007.  I have used these same ones repeatedly with accurate results for many years, so you do not need to dispose of them after one use.  I tested the results of these 7 year old heavily coated cardboard-type thermometers against the results of a regular mercury glass oral thermometer result and the results were the same, so they retain their accuracy over many, many uses.  The moisture in the mouth does not degrade the temp stick.  After showing the exact temperature, the dots return to unused state after a few seconds.  My only complaint is that I have to buy a box of them instead of one or two.  I keep one in my purse and at my bedside so you don&#x27;t have to search for one when you need it.  I can only find them online, not in drug stores.  I don&#x27;t know why that is.</li>
            <li> The idea is great however I have tried many and they do not seem to work.  I wish they did, I ended up buying a hand held thermometer.  Make sure you check the expiration date.  Mine were still within date and perhaps I was unlikely.</li>
            <li> These are very convenient to use, except that they are hard to read.  The dots are very tiny and even with my reading glasses it is hard to determine the temperature.  If you have good eyesight this might be a non-issue for you.</li>
            <li> So glad i got these for when our kids get sick&lt;br /&gt;Reliable and easy and clean  it will last for years</li>
            <li> One thing you don&#x27;t want to do when you feel bad is spend hours trying to find where you hide the thermometer the last time you felt bad.  stash a handful of these everywhere you look and you are set.</li>
            <li> These are great disposable thermometers, accurate to fractions of a degree.  I prefer these because they are disposable and thus more sanitary, as well as not requiring a battery or special care.  Throw a few wherever you might need them, I have some in my desk at the office.</li>
            <li> I have kids around all the time, so this will be handy. And I will pass them out to all my kids.</li>
            <li> I love these disposable thermometers. I&#x27;ve used them on my babies after having several digital thermometers yield inaccurate results. They are great for underarm temps and oral. Easy to read, and results are retained on the strip making comparisons easy.</li>
            <li> My old trusty glass mercury thermometer broke on me had to find a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordered a these after reading reviews, use them just like a regular thermometer, one use per.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t have to worry about the battery being dead (always happens on those cheap digital thermometer&#x27;s).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And a 100 of them should last quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I would caution, avoid ordering these in the summer when the temperature gets higher than 98.6 as you will probably end up with a whole package of unusable items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John</li>
            <li> I got these for first aid kits and the box contains the instructions but the individual packages do not.  They are difficult to read as the green dots often turn black quickly; therefore, not allowing you to measure your temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the thermometers for a cheap not exact check but overall they could have done better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a link to the instructions:  [...]Hopefully they&#x27;ll keep the link.</li>
            <li> When you feel feverish, and it&#x27;s night time and the light is a little dimmer, and you feel pretty crummy, you&#x27;ll have a devil of a time reading the tiny little dots to try to figure out what the heck your temperature is.</li>
            <li> These are way too hard to read!  You are suppose to look at the black dots to see the reading but the black and the dark green are too close in color to determine a good reading.  I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> The NexTemp disposable thermometers have always been a great product.  Unfortunately, they have never been popular enough to lower the significantly high price.  Most professionals and first responders don&#x27;t use them simply because of the low price digital thermometers.  The use I have for them, however, make them essential.  Since I&#x27;m an avid backpacker and Boy Scout Scoutmaster, they are perfect for my field medical bag.  Lightweight and impossible to break they make the perfect solution to an otherwise baffling problem.</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery!  As described!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Cheaper than electronic thermometers and more user friendly.</li>
            <li> Great idea - and cost is reasonable.  However, like some of the other reviewers, when I received my box of disposable thermometers, many of them had already been activated, and were no longer usable.  I have used these several times, and they appear to give a good temperature reading.  I like the disposable feature, and will likely purchase similar product in the future, but will not purchase via the mail.  Not confident that the warehouse handling or shipping protects these well enough to keep them from being activated ahead of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the cost, I did not return.</li>
