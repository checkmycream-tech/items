            <li> I have think long hair, which tend to look fuzzy in rainy days.</li>

            <li> Unsure what happened here, but this is the most disgusting shampoo I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I never had this problem before, I am really disappointed because I was very excited to  get it, and it is so expensive.</li>
            <li> , it leaves my hair dull and lifeless.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> did get it at a steep discount from amazon and it leaves me wondering if I got a fake one.</li>

            <li> It is oily so my hair roots appear dirty and greasy after washing.</li>
            <li> My hair would look awful without this product.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> this is one of the best shampoo for damaged or straightned hair. have been using it for the last one year and the results are amazing. if you use lot of heat on your hair then this is a must have shampoo for you.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and silky, yet maintains body. I have tried other shampoos , but this is the only one  that works for me.</li>
            <li> My friend came to visit me, and she uses this same shampoo &amp; conditioner, so I used some of hers to experience, and I love it, so i decided to buy it. I bought the shampoo and conditioner. However; the shampoo or the conditioner made my hair so disgusting, it is sticky together, and dry now. Very hard to brush. I never had this problem before, I am really disappointed because I was very excited to  get it, and it is so expensive. Anyways, the smell seems to give me headache as well. I WILL NEVER BUY IT AGAIN, AND I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT (at least from here).&lt;br /&gt;BTW - I had to buy the anti residue shampoo to give me peace again.</li>
            <li> Have been using product for a few weeks - don&#x27;t see much difference in my hair todate but maybe will have to use longer for better results.  I don&#x27;t have to use as much as regular shampoos so it will last longer.</li>
            <li> Not pleased with conditioner</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for years and recommended to my friends as we&#x27;ll. It eliminates split ends, makes hair more voluminous, stronger, shinier. My hair never grew as long before, now about 6 inches longer. It was originally recommended to me in a French hair salon and I am very grateful.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo from India, few times I brought it from there. After sometime I searched in Amazon, found it for the same price, I love this shampoo it works good with its conditioner.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is the best I have ever used. It cleans and conditions without leaving any residue or weight. This is my second purchase and I plan to continue using it.</li>
            <li> I have used this SHAMPO for a long time with their curly hair series condish mask, (moist SHAMPO should be followed with light condish).&lt;br /&gt;I switch off and use the curly hair line and the condish to this SHAMPO, ( light SHAMPO should be followed with a heavier condish.&lt;br /&gt;Its good to switch off. I have my license  to buy at beauty supply stores, however to buy this product at salon centric you have to own or work at a shop that sells this line or you can not purchase from the beauty supply store.&lt;br /&gt;So I know how much this should really cost yet I am paying two times the amount to buy it. The product is that good.</li>
            <li> One of best products that my wife useing it so far, she loves, the quality of products is always stay the same thanks for vender,</li>
            <li> I read a great deal of review and was counting big time when I purchased this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;After washing my hear ( chemically treated)  while drying it feels sticky and once dry, it leaves my hair dull and lifeless.&lt;br /&gt;I did get it at a steep discount from amazon and it leaves me wondering if I got a fake one.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. My hair does not fall out .It moisturizes my hair. And I always get compliments on how my hair looks so healthy and radiant!</li>
            <li> I thought after reading the reviews that I would love this product but it left my hair very greasy :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair for years and it has a tendency to frizz in the Florida humidity (not the hair color&#x27;s fault; my hair frizzes without any help).  This shampoo is the best I&#x27;ve ever used for this.  Leaves the hair smooth and shiny.  Might not be the best if your hair is oily (mine used to be) but for normal, dry or colored hair, it should be great.</li>
            <li> My hair would look awful without this product. I have think long hair, which tend to look fuzzy in rainy days. This product makes my hair look always beautiful.</li>
            <li> Unsure what happened here, but this is the most disgusting shampoo I have ever used. It is oily so my hair roots appear dirty and greasy after washing. What a waste of money. Will attempt to return.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great for damaged hair. The 50.7 oz saves money and time. I would definitely recommend this product.  The only down side is there is no pump supplied with the product.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great, I was pregnant and my hair was luscious and shine then I had the baby and my hair start to fall and look really dull and lifeless.&lt;br /&gt;My mom who is a user for over 2 years recommended and I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;My hair came back to life! It&#x27;s shine and with the mask once week feels like a shampoo commercial every day.&lt;br /&gt;But my hair is thick, long and dry as I dye regularly, I would not think it would a good match for thin oily hair.</li>
