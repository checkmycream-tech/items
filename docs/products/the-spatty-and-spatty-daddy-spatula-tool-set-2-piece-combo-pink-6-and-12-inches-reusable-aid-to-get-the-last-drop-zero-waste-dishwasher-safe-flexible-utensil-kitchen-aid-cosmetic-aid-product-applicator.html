            <li>I loved the idea of them the minute I saw them on Shark Tank.  </li>

            <li>THEY LOVED IT.  </li>
            <li>I love this great product.</li>
            <li>and they think they are very handy and just love them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great idea and a great prototype but needs more fine turning.</li>
            <li>Love them!  </li>
            <li>I love this set!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I LOVE these!</li>
            <li>I love them!  </li>
            <li>Product is ok but pricey!</li>
            <li>but it has come in handy when I have.</li>
            <li>Handy product.</li>
            <li>; I just stored away, would be nice to have 2-6&amp;#34; in a set.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li>even slimmer would be nice.</li>
            <li>Perfectly shaped to really get things out of a bottle or jar.</li>
            <li>Gave as gifts my gifts were well liked.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure it is going to come in handy at some point.  </li>
            <li>I love them and have wanted to own a set since I saw them on Shark Tank.</li>
            <li>We originally saw these on Shark Tank and thought it was a good idea.</li>
            <li>Saw this first on Shark Tank, and it&#x27;s a great idea.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m satisfied with reaching most of the bottle contents.  </li>
            <li>The product is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I would want it to be more flexible.</li>
            <li>I just love these.</li>
            <li>I am able to get most of the contents out using the smallest spatty in this pack.  </li>
            <li>It is a cost saver for sure.  </li>
            <li>Really glad I got them.</li>
            <li>Love them&lt;br /&gt;Joan</li>
            <li>Love that they are dishwasher safe.</li>
            <li>It is a great product and really does the job.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK - have used it maybe one time, so it seems like something you need</li>
            <li>Works well,  I can get quite a bit more product out of the container by using these.  </li>
            <li>I wish the handle was more flexible, though.  </li>
            <li>that what it is just ok.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous product!</li>
            <li>Better price when purchased as a set.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I despise wasting products so these are perfect for smaller cosmetic jars, tubes, etc.</li>
            <li>I use the 6 inch more.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love the way I can get all the cream out of my bottles with this spatula.  </li>
            <li>One of the most savings items I have ever bought.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall impression is that it&#x27;s OK, but I&#x27;m still looking for something better for the shapes of bottles</li>
            <li>Not anymore I am able to scoop all of it out.</li>
            <li>I love these two make-up/lotion spatulas.  </li>
            <li>I am really pleased with the Spatty Pair.  </li>
            <li>Love my spatties.  </li>
            <li>and I was so pleased with it</li>
            <li>Fits into lotion jars but would be more efficient if it were spoon shaped.</li>
            <li>Love the product.  </li>
            <li>She has gotten 10 more uses out of makeup</li>
            <li>I love these.  </li>
            <li>and I could have used these so many times.</li>
            <li>Order these, you will really use these!!!!</li>
            <li>the handles are perfect for reaching into those long neck jars.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s remarkable how much product we throw out when we think our tube or bottle is &amp;#34;empty&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Other that that LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I really am glad I saw this presentation on Shark Tank, I also really liked the creator and I wish her and her family much success.</li>
            <li>Love the concept but was looking for something that would fit into a lipstick gloss tube.</li>
            <li>Product is good quality, I am not using it quite as much as I thought I would</li>
            <li>Although I love Amazon, and buy almost everything on here, I also like to see what&#x27;s offered on the original product website.</li>
            <li>However it works well and is easy to use..</li>
            <li>After years of banging lotion bottles, the spatty makes it so easy to get every drop.  </li>
            <li>Trimmed up easily w/ scissors.</li>
            <li>Easy peasy.</li>
            <li>Will pay for themselves very quickly.</li>
            <li>Great, it was exactly as ordered and exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Works good at getting to the bottom, no waste!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like I got one free.</li>
            <li>This product is great for getting those last drops of product out of a bottle that otherwise would have been thrown away.</li>
            <li>Great product -- only wish I had thought of it.</li>
            <li>I use both sizes quite often - the smaller one is great for sample size tubes.</li>
            <li>The big one is great for lotions like nivea which have tall bottles with pumps that don&#x27;t reach all the way to the bottom.</li>
            <li>so it would fit in the container</li>
            <li>It is amazing how much product you are throwing away.</li>
            <li>I wanted this to fit inside a lipstick sponge tube.</li>
            <li>What a great way to save some money in the future!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed!!</li>
            <li>Very useful Tools.</li>
            <li>Very useful and lets me use all the product.</li>
            <li>Maybe one day I will be very happy that I bought these two &amp;#34;mini-spatulas,&amp;#34; but so far I have discovered that I don&#x27;t really have much of a need for them!</li>
            <li>I saw this darling, super enthusiastic young lady on Shark Tank!!!</li>
            <li>I was so excited about seeing these on Shark Tank.</li>
            <li>I just purchased this product from thespatty.com, the original website.</li>
            <li>I first saw this invention presented on the television program &amp;#34;Shark Tank&amp;#34; and was so glad to see that it was offered on the Amazon web site.</li>
            <li>I was excited about this product</li>
            <li>I wish her continued success!</li>
            <li>The small one is great for the liquid makeup and lipsticks too!</li>
            <li>If I had been a rich investor, I would have helped you along.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so excited to have them.</li>
            <li>The small one is perfect for makeup jars.</li>
            <li>Perfect for what I need to get at those hard to reach places in jars, etc.  </li>
            <li>Use it for my face cream even if the jar is full, so that the cream doesn&#x27;t go under my fingernails.</li>
            <li>My wife really was glad to see product on market</li>
            <li>and it is good to the last drop.  </li>
            <li>The small spatty fits in great, washes off quickly and done!  </li>
            <li>They are good for so many small spaces and bottles.</li>
            <li>Finally, no more wasting good product!</li>
            <li>This is such an amazing device.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as expected, received it quickly and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to anyone who wants to get the most out of their makeup bottle or any container.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll them right here to use.  </li>
            <li>It paid for itself right away.</li>
            <li>Far superior to the methods I used before to extract what is left in lotion bottles.  </li>
            <li>They are OK for other things but not for my primary reason to purchase.  </li>
            <li>These really work!  </li>
            <li>Yes, I not only recommend them but will be purchasing more -- maybe as gifts.</li>
            <li>TOO FUNNY</li>
            <li>Love them I buy a product in a pump bottle that i never get the last of it out.</li>
            <li>Really does save you money!</li>
            <li>I love that there are two different sizes.  </li>
            <li>Works exactly as promised.</li>
            <li>This is the 1st time I have been able to get the bottle actually cleaned out.</li>
            <li>I first saw this on Shark Tank.</li>
            <li>I love that I can get the last bit of moisturizer out of the jar that I couldn&#x27;t before.</li>
            <li>i haven&#x27;t use the large one but the small one is very handy for deporting cream products</li>
            <li>The large one for the bottom of the lotion bottle - I am able to get several weeks of lotion that otherwise would have gone in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Product!!!</li>
            <li>Also, good for small gift items.</li>
            <li>finally able to get every last drop of lotion out of jar of high end hand lotion that I bought</li>
            <li>I was just getting to the bottom of a jar of face moisturizer and a large bottle of body lotion when I received these in the mail.  </li>
            <li>Will fit most bottles except very narrow openings.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve saved some perfect little jars for the little gold mines I&#x27;ll come up with.</li>
            <li>I really wanted something to use for lip gloss tubes and the 6&amp;#34; in too large for that purpose.  </li>
            <li>The large is great for larger jars or bottles, like narrow mustard containers.</li>
            <li>this makes deporting products so much easier.  </li>
            <li>These mini spatulas both work really well</li>
            <li>and they really  work  </li>
            <li>Reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it really shows you how much waste there is when you think you have used all that is in the bottle, then you use your spatty and see just how much more is left.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t  know that I was throwing away so much products in bottles until I started using spatty daddy.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li>A really neat invention.</li>
            <li>I really like and use this product.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much</li>
            <li>Fast shipping...</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe how much product I was wasting before.</li>
            <li>and my mom really wanted one.</li>
            <li>Nothing else to really say.  </li>
            <li>very useful for digging out last drops of cosmetics; will recommend to friends</li>
            <li>I guess other ladies might not find them as appealing.</li>
            <li>This is a cool product, really has help me get the last drop of everything.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m determined each morning to waste an incredible amount of time beating the container against things to get it out, or trying not to over-dump what accumulated when it was upside down.</li>
            <li>I cut my tube of face wash in half and scraped out several more weeks worth of product, which really makes the Spatty pay for itself.</li>
            <li>These are awesome to get the last amounts out of those expensive toiletries and makeup containers.</li>
            <li>(a lot of times several more uses) and put into a small plastic cosmetic pot with a lid, or secure the opening with a clothespin.</li>
            <li>The large one is easily large enough for large lotion bottles I have at home.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend them!&lt;br /&gt;NH</li>
            <li>Love these little inventions.</li>
            <li>Love these little spatulas.</li>
            <li>I think if the product was round it would be better.</li>
            <li>I get a few more days  out of every squeeze bottle</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to use all my product that is in pump lotion bottles and nothing goes to waste</li>
            <li>I bought the regular Spatty and Spatty Daddy (pair), so I always have the right size spatula to avoid wasting product.</li>
            <li>I cannot live without these.  </li>
            <li>Very surprised that the creator didn&#x27;t think about this since she&#x27;s a woman.</li>
            <li>Shipping is very reasonable at only $2.50.</li>
            <li>A very smart young lady actually did it!</li>
            <li>I was able to use my expensive Chanel foundation for 2 more weeks because the spatty helped me get every last drop.</li>
            <li>I have use the small one almost every day and love it.  </li>
            <li>I love getting the last drop out of a product and these do it, especially the smaller one,</li>
            <li>The spatula has similar flexibility to a regular rubber spatula, maybe a little more rigid, but much smaller to fit into tighter spaces.</li>
            <li>I originally saw this product on the show &amp;#34;Shark Tank.&amp;#34;  I am using it for its original purpose which is to fully empty a container of its contents; thereby, eliminating waste.  </li>
            <li>handle is a semi-stiff white plastic sized a bit like a MacDonald&#x27;s straw on the large spatula.  </li>
            <li>Package that was to contain two items only contained the large spatty.</li>
            <li>They work as advertised and my wife loves being able to get the last little bit out of her girly stuff.</li>
            <li>It arrived in a clear plastic bag.</li>
            <li>As another reviewer pointed out, it is still a problem getting out the remaining contents directly below the mouth of the bottle</li>
            <li>but there is so much product left in them.</li>
            <li>wow what a help these have been.</li>
            <li>You really can get every last drop.</li>
            <li>Surprised me.  </li>
            <li>I have long fingernails and this allows me to take out exactly the amount I need without getting it under my nails.  </li>
            <li>bought this Spatty set directly from the manufacturer via a deal site.</li>
            <li>Thank you to that young woman inventor who appeared on Shark Tank.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stand to just throw away perfectly good product just because it is difficult to reach.  </li>
            <li>The small size is perfect for makeup bottles or other small bottles.</li>
            <li>These simple little spatulas make it so easy to extract all of the product out of the container.  </li>
            <li>They are well made and the larger one will be good to dig deep for those last bits of hard to get at products.  </li>
            <li>Also stiff bottles such as Proactiv face wash are easily defeated with the Spatty, as well as foundation that comes in jars.  </li>
            <li>but I was hoping the tip would be a bit more flexible (like LeCreuset) to get past tight spaces of the bottle neck and really move the creams and lotions out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>These little spatulas let me swipe easily, getting the rest in usable amounts until the container is either fully empty or nearly so (depending on shape).  </li>
            <li>This is the only one of many of the spatulas that fits into a very small chanel makeup bottle.  </li>
            <li>Very sturdy materials should last a long time.</li>
            <li>Product came fast and as expected.</li>
            <li>Being male I do not use makeup, however I do use sunscreen being that I live in Southern California.  </li>
            <li>This item was one of the few that I have purchased that did exactly what was advertised.  </li>
            <li>Worked wonders in the first few days of use.</li>
            <li>Wife loves it, uses it pretty much everyday.  </li>

            <li> Very imaginative name</li>
            <li> and I was so excited when I found this on Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> good.</li>
            <li> didnt work as good as I thought</li>
            <li> I loved the spatty idea when I saw it on Shark Tank.</li>
            <li> I loved the idea of them the minute I saw them on Shark Tank.  </li>
            <li> Good size and quality.</li>
            <li> THEY LOVED IT.  </li>
            <li> I love this great product.</li>
            <li> and they think they are very handy and just love them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great idea and a great prototype but needs more fine turning.</li>
            <li> Love them!  </li>
            <li> I love this set!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE these!</li>
            <li> I love them!  </li>
            <li> Product is ok but pricey!</li>
            <li> but it has come in handy when I have.</li>
            <li> Handy product.</li>
            <li> ; I just stored away, would be nice to have 2-6&amp;#34; in a set.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> even slimmer would be nice.</li>
            <li> Perfectly shaped to really get things out of a bottle or jar.</li>
            <li> Gave as gifts my gifts were well liked.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure it is going to come in handy at some point.  </li>
            <li> I love them and have wanted to own a set since I saw them on Shark Tank.</li>
            <li> We originally saw these on Shark Tank and thought it was a good idea.</li>
            <li> Saw this first on Shark Tank, and it&#x27;s a great idea.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m satisfied with reaching most of the bottle contents.  </li>
            <li> The product is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I would want it to be more flexible.</li>
            <li> I just love these.</li>
            <li> I am able to get most of the contents out using the smallest spatty in this pack.  </li>
            <li> It is a cost saver for sure.  </li>
            <li> Really glad I got them.</li>
            <li> Love them&lt;br /&gt;Joan</li>
            <li> Love that they are dishwasher safe.</li>
            <li> It is a great product and really does the job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK - have used it maybe one time, so it seems like something you need</li>
            <li> Works well,  I can get quite a bit more product out of the container by using these.  </li>
            <li> I wish the handle was more flexible, though.  </li>
            <li> that what it is just ok.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product!</li>
            <li> Better price when purchased as a set.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I despise wasting products so these are perfect for smaller cosmetic jars, tubes, etc.</li>
            <li> I use the 6 inch more.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love the way I can get all the cream out of my bottles with this spatula.  </li>
            <li> One of the most savings items I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall impression is that it&#x27;s OK, but I&#x27;m still looking for something better for the shapes of bottles</li>
            <li> Not anymore I am able to scoop all of it out.</li>
            <li> I love these two make-up/lotion spatulas.  </li>
            <li> I am really pleased with the Spatty Pair.  </li>
            <li> Love my spatties.  </li>
            <li> and I was so pleased with it</li>
            <li> Fits into lotion jars but would be more efficient if it were spoon shaped.</li>
            <li> Love the product.  </li>
            <li> She has gotten 10 more uses out of makeup</li>
            <li> I love these.  </li>
            <li> and I could have used these so many times.</li>
            <li> Order these, you will really use these!!!!</li>
            <li> the handles are perfect for reaching into those long neck jars.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s remarkable how much product we throw out when we think our tube or bottle is &amp;#34;empty&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Other that that LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I really am glad I saw this presentation on Shark Tank, I also really liked the creator and I wish her and her family much success.</li>
            <li> Love the concept but was looking for something that would fit into a lipstick gloss tube.</li>
            <li> Product is good quality, I am not using it quite as much as I thought I would</li>
            <li> Although I love Amazon, and buy almost everything on here, I also like to see what&#x27;s offered on the original product website.</li>
            <li> However it works well and is easy to use..</li>
            <li> After years of banging lotion bottles, the spatty makes it so easy to get every drop.  </li>
            <li> Trimmed up easily w/ scissors.</li>
            <li> Easy peasy.</li>
            <li> Will pay for themselves very quickly.</li>
            <li> Great, it was exactly as ordered and exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Works good at getting to the bottom, no waste!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like I got one free.</li>
            <li> This product is great for getting those last drops of product out of a bottle that otherwise would have been thrown away.</li>
            <li> Great product -- only wish I had thought of it.</li>
            <li> I use both sizes quite often - the smaller one is great for sample size tubes.</li>
            <li> The big one is great for lotions like nivea which have tall bottles with pumps that don&#x27;t reach all the way to the bottom.</li>
            <li> so it would fit in the container</li>
            <li> It is amazing how much product you are throwing away.</li>
            <li> I wanted this to fit inside a lipstick sponge tube.</li>
            <li> What a great way to save some money in the future!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed!!</li>
            <li> Very useful Tools.</li>
            <li> Very useful and lets me use all the product.</li>
            <li> Maybe one day I will be very happy that I bought these two &amp;#34;mini-spatulas,&amp;#34; but so far I have discovered that I don&#x27;t really have much of a need for them!</li>
            <li> I saw this darling, super enthusiastic young lady on Shark Tank!!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited about seeing these on Shark Tank.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this product from thespatty.com, the original website.</li>
            <li> I first saw this invention presented on the television program &amp;#34;Shark Tank&amp;#34; and was so glad to see that it was offered on the Amazon web site.</li>
            <li> I was excited about this product</li>
            <li> I wish her continued success!</li>
            <li> The small one is great for the liquid makeup and lipsticks too!</li>
            <li> If I had been a rich investor, I would have helped you along.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so excited to have them.</li>
            <li> The small one is perfect for makeup jars.</li>
            <li> Perfect for what I need to get at those hard to reach places in jars, etc.  </li>
            <li> Use it for my face cream even if the jar is full, so that the cream doesn&#x27;t go under my fingernails.</li>
            <li> My wife really was glad to see product on market</li>
            <li> and it is good to the last drop.  </li>
            <li> The small spatty fits in great, washes off quickly and done!  </li>
            <li> They are good for so many small spaces and bottles.</li>
            <li> Finally, no more wasting good product!</li>
            <li> This is such an amazing device.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as expected, received it quickly and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to anyone who wants to get the most out of their makeup bottle or any container.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll them right here to use.  </li>
            <li> It paid for itself right away.</li>
            <li> Far superior to the methods I used before to extract what is left in lotion bottles.  </li>
            <li> They are OK for other things but not for my primary reason to purchase.  </li>
            <li> These really work!  </li>
            <li> Yes, I not only recommend them but will be purchasing more -- maybe as gifts.</li>
            <li> TOO FUNNY</li>
            <li> Love them I buy a product in a pump bottle that i never get the last of it out.</li>
            <li> Really does save you money!</li>
            <li> I love that there are two different sizes.  </li>
            <li> Works exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> This is the 1st time I have been able to get the bottle actually cleaned out.</li>
            <li> I first saw this on Shark Tank.</li>
            <li> I love that I can get the last bit of moisturizer out of the jar that I couldn&#x27;t before.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t use the large one but the small one is very handy for deporting cream products</li>
            <li> The large one for the bottom of the lotion bottle - I am able to get several weeks of lotion that otherwise would have gone in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Product!!!</li>
            <li> Also, good for small gift items.</li>
            <li> finally able to get every last drop of lotion out of jar of high end hand lotion that I bought</li>
            <li> I was just getting to the bottom of a jar of face moisturizer and a large bottle of body lotion when I received these in the mail.  </li>
            <li> Will fit most bottles except very narrow openings.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve saved some perfect little jars for the little gold mines I&#x27;ll come up with.</li>
            <li> I really wanted something to use for lip gloss tubes and the 6&amp;#34; in too large for that purpose.  </li>
            <li> The large is great for larger jars or bottles, like narrow mustard containers.</li>
            <li> this makes deporting products so much easier.  </li>
            <li> These mini spatulas both work really well</li>
            <li> and they really  work  </li>
            <li> Reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it really shows you how much waste there is when you think you have used all that is in the bottle, then you use your spatty and see just how much more is left.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t  know that I was throwing away so much products in bottles until I started using spatty daddy.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li> A really neat invention.</li>
            <li> I really like and use this product.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much</li>
            <li> Fast shipping...</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe how much product I was wasting before.</li>
            <li> and my mom really wanted one.</li>
            <li> Nothing else to really say.  </li>
            <li> very useful for digging out last drops of cosmetics; will recommend to friends</li>
            <li> I guess other ladies might not find them as appealing.</li>
            <li> This is a cool product, really has help me get the last drop of everything.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m determined each morning to waste an incredible amount of time beating the container against things to get it out, or trying not to over-dump what accumulated when it was upside down.</li>
            <li> I cut my tube of face wash in half and scraped out several more weeks worth of product, which really makes the Spatty pay for itself.</li>
            <li> These are awesome to get the last amounts out of those expensive toiletries and makeup containers.</li>
            <li> (a lot of times several more uses) and put into a small plastic cosmetic pot with a lid, or secure the opening with a clothespin.</li>
            <li> The large one is easily large enough for large lotion bottles I have at home.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend them!&lt;br /&gt;NH</li>
            <li> Love these little inventions.</li>
            <li> Love these little spatulas.</li>
            <li> I think if the product was round it would be better.</li>
            <li> I get a few more days  out of every squeeze bottle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to use all my product that is in pump lotion bottles and nothing goes to waste</li>
            <li> I bought the regular Spatty and Spatty Daddy (pair), so I always have the right size spatula to avoid wasting product.</li>
            <li> I cannot live without these.  </li>
            <li> Very surprised that the creator didn&#x27;t think about this since she&#x27;s a woman.</li>
            <li> Shipping is very reasonable at only $2.50.</li>
            <li> A very smart young lady actually did it!</li>
            <li> I was able to use my expensive Chanel foundation for 2 more weeks because the spatty helped me get every last drop.</li>
            <li> I have use the small one almost every day and love it.  </li>
            <li> I love getting the last drop out of a product and these do it, especially the smaller one,</li>
            <li> The spatula has similar flexibility to a regular rubber spatula, maybe a little more rigid, but much smaller to fit into tighter spaces.</li>
            <li> I originally saw this product on the show &amp;#34;Shark Tank.&amp;#34;  I am using it for its original purpose which is to fully empty a container of its contents; thereby, eliminating waste.  </li>
            <li> handle is a semi-stiff white plastic sized a bit like a MacDonald&#x27;s straw on the large spatula.  </li>
            <li> Package that was to contain two items only contained the large spatty.</li>
            <li> They work as advertised and my wife loves being able to get the last little bit out of her girly stuff.</li>
            <li> It arrived in a clear plastic bag.</li>
            <li> As another reviewer pointed out, it is still a problem getting out the remaining contents directly below the mouth of the bottle</li>
            <li> but there is so much product left in them.</li>
            <li> wow what a help these have been.</li>
            <li> You really can get every last drop.</li>
            <li> Surprised me.  </li>
            <li> I have long fingernails and this allows me to take out exactly the amount I need without getting it under my nails.  </li>
            <li> bought this Spatty set directly from the manufacturer via a deal site.</li>
            <li> Thank you to that young woman inventor who appeared on Shark Tank.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand to just throw away perfectly good product just because it is difficult to reach.  </li>
            <li> The small size is perfect for makeup bottles or other small bottles.</li>
            <li> These simple little spatulas make it so easy to extract all of the product out of the container.  </li>
            <li> They are well made and the larger one will be good to dig deep for those last bits of hard to get at products.  </li>
            <li> Also stiff bottles such as Proactiv face wash are easily defeated with the Spatty, as well as foundation that comes in jars.  </li>
            <li> but I was hoping the tip would be a bit more flexible (like LeCreuset) to get past tight spaces of the bottle neck and really move the creams and lotions out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> These little spatulas let me swipe easily, getting the rest in usable amounts until the container is either fully empty or nearly so (depending on shape).  </li>
            <li> This is the only one of many of the spatulas that fits into a very small chanel makeup bottle.  </li>
            <li> Very sturdy materials should last a long time.</li>
            <li> Product came fast and as expected.</li>
            <li> Being male I do not use makeup, however I do use sunscreen being that I live in Southern California.  </li>
            <li> This item was one of the few that I have purchased that did exactly what was advertised.  </li>
            <li> Worked wonders in the first few days of use.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it, uses it pretty much everyday.  </li>
            <li> does what it is supposed to do just not sure how much I will actually use it.</li>
            <li> It is hard to get all the contents out of them and the Little Spatty worked fine.  </li>
            <li> The actual head is made of rubber and while the rubber material is very pliable, the white stick part goes down far enough because of the small size that the overall effect is a bit stiff.  </li>
            <li> The handle is too wide, especially for the small one, and it does not even fit in my small make up bottles as promised.</li>
            <li> Used the small spatula on a bottle of face cream, was surprised that there was about 1/2 inch of product left in the bottle.</li>
            <li> Waited so long to order them after the owner of the company was on Shark Tank.  </li>
            <li> You will be amazed at how much is really left in a bottle when you think it is empty.  </li>
            <li> did come with the pink cardboard and plastic packaging and the product was completely different.</li>
            <li> 1 3/8 inches long by 5/8 inches wide, while the smaller Spatty measures 6 inches with a spatula part a hair under 5/8 inches long by 3/8 inches wide.</li>
            <li> The product had flat edges where the spatula (pink part) was suppose to be angled (to scrape edges of bottles).</li>
            <li> I bought this as a present for makeup retention....getting those last few drops from the bottle.  </li>
            <li> There is no more wasted product at the bottom of jars or bottles anymore thanks to the Spatty!  </li>
            <li> (I actually had 5 other almost empty lotion bottles sitting around</li>
            <li> This product really does get into every small little place thus saving you the product you can not seem to get out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Nearly useless because the small one doesn&#x27;t fit inside of any of my make up bottles!</li>
            <li> The small one works well to scrape out the last of foundation or moisturizer left in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I know they aren&#x27;t super expensive glosses</li>
            <li> But when I gave it for a present, the recipient was using it for getting the last drops of mustard and other small neck grocery items.  </li>
            <li> These little spatulas help you to make your make up and moisturizer last WAY longer.</li>
            <li> but it was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> pink rubber tip measures</li>
            <li> Size not what expected-</li>
            <li> Big waste of time.</li>
            <li> Just as expected and described</li>
            <li> This item (even the small one) is too big for any lipstick products.</li>
            <li> the small one is used daily</li>
            <li> Too big for any make up or small dispenser</li>
            <li> I usually scrape what&#x27;s left of tubes</li>
            <li> Upon receiving these spatulas, washing and drying them, I used them to scrap face cream, foundation and lipstick out of several small containers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the answer to getting the last drop out of jars and small bottles.</li>
            <li> I can now recycle bottles without having sharp cut edges to them.  </li>
            <li> They are particularly helpful for skin lotion that comes in a pump bottle - it&#x27;s usually next to impossible to get it all out when it gets low.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as I have a large bottle of  expensive lotion.</li>
            <li> I HATE keeping (shampoo, hand lotion, etc) bottles upside down to try to get the (sometimes significant amount of) product left when the pump stops working.  </li>
            <li> I put sunscreen in travel bottles for our flight down to Florida.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I have negative to say is how it does not clean up well with soap and water.</li>
            <li> The Spatty saves money in the long run, especially on those expensive face creams.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little firmer than I&#x27;d like, but it does the job</li>
            <li> Gets all the makeup out of her little bottles.</li>
            <li> I like the concept of the product, however, the smallest size still does not fit into my makeup</li>
            <li> But will not fit into lipgloss tubes.  </li>
            <li> I was brought up not to waste, so</li>
            <li> a waste of resources, money and din on the environment.</li>
            <li> The spatula was almost as thick as it was wide.</li>
            <li> The spatula itself is too narrow on both</li>
            <li> a definite rip-off</li>
            <li> They have paid for themselves within a few months.  </li>
            <li> I used to cut open the bottles, but spatty make this unnecessary.  </li>
            <li> Pays for itself in a few uses, we get all the lotion out of the bottle now.</li>
            <li> This is a lifesaver for those on a tight budget!</li>
            <li> No more wasted creams thrown away.  </li>
            <li> As the head is small and stiff, it does take time to move stuff out as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was shocked to see how much product I have wasted up to this point.  </li>
            <li> No more wasting product.</li>
            <li> I have used the small one to get the rest of the product out of a lip stick tube.  </li>
            <li> These Spattys have already paid for themselves by getting every last bit of liquid out of my expensive makeup and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The box packaging Amazon used was excessive material.  </li>
            <li> It was disturbing that an item such as this had to be put into a box at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is the material it is made out of or</li>
            <li> , pink rubber tip measures approximately 1.5\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Small spatty:&lt;br</li>
            <li> IT WAS A SMALL ADD ON GIFT...</li>
            <li> The small one works for face lotions and makeup.  </li>
            <li> I use clarins liquid makeup which is fairly expensive and there is always some left in the bottom and the small spatty gets it out.</li>
            <li> It is too hard and stiff and won&#x27;t move well inside bottle</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still very messy to use.</li>
            <li> As expensive as products are these days, I&#x27;m not throwing away a single drop of my hard earned money.  </li>
            <li> It is a little tough to get into the angled edges of bottles.</li>
            <li> This little thing will save me $1,000&#x27;s!!</li>
            <li> These are kinda thick for a spatula and that makes it hard to get stuff out with them.</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t have to risk slicing myself when cutting open bottles like I use to.  </li>
            <li> they are wayyyyy to thick to even get into the lip glosses.</li>
            <li> Anyway to thick...</li>
            <li> This product is too thick.</li>
            <li> foundation/concealer at the bottom of a small glass bottle, use these...gonna save at least 50 bucks per year!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s self, no more waste with expensive cosmetic products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all types of methods to get the remaining contents out of bottles - sometimes cutting the plastic bottle in half which is not easy.  </li>
            <li> I have a small container of eye moisturizer that is really expensive</li>
            <li> The spatula was very hard and was not flexible at all.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I have a base primer bottle with an opening that is 3/8in (the diameter is larger</li>
            <li> I hate wasting expensive, or even inexpensive, lotions, cleansers and cosmetics and had struggled for years with shaking, squeezing and funneling containers to try and remove every last drop.  </li>
            <li> Just a little disappointed on the price mark-up here.</li>
            <li> I knew who was tired of throwing out unused product that you can se at the bottom of the container and can&#x27;t get to!</li>
            <li> To me, useless</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, should come with a disclaimer to not leave it in the jar/tube/bottle for any length of time as my spatty has now disintegrated and is the consistency of bubblegum--already chewed.</li>
            <li> Here is the way things work with my expensive makeup - I get to the end of the jar and can&#x27;t get it out</li>
            <li> It takes the product out so it does work, but it gets really messy on the handle which i hate!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t  hesitate to buy them you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> DRIVE THE HUSBAND CRAZY!</li>
            <li> but I saw it on shark tank and thought how stupid they were to not get in on it.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Exactly what I needed!!</li>
            <li> I wanted these since I saw them on Shark Tank.  I&#x27;ve tried all types of methods to get the remaining contents out of bottles - sometimes cutting the plastic bottle in half which is not easy.  The Spatty pair have solved the problem.  As another reviewer pointed out, it is still a problem getting out the remaining contents directly below the mouth of the bottle but I&#x27;m satisfied with reaching most of the bottle contents.  Great products.  (My daughters are getting them as stocking stuffers this year.)</li>
            <li> I basically ordered the spatulas for my MAC lip glosses...they are wayyyyy to thick to even get into the lip glosses. I know they aren&#x27;t super expensive glosses but there is so much product left in them. Anyway to thick...</li>
            <li> One of the best ideas EVER!</li>
            <li> very useful for digging out last drops of cosmetics; will recommend to friends</li>
            <li> Love these little inventions.</li>
            <li> Worked great! Got every last drop from the tube.</li>
            <li> I would have rather not given ANY stars for this product. This item (even the small one) is too big for any lipstick products. Very surprised that the creator didn&#x27;t think about this since she&#x27;s a woman.</li>
            <li> I like the concept of the product, however, the smallest size still does not fit into my makeup&lt;br /&gt;bottles.  I think if the product was round it would be better.</li>
            <li> Nearly useless because the small one doesn&#x27;t fit inside of any of my make up bottles!</li>
            <li> I originally saw this product on the show &amp;#34;Shark Tank.&amp;#34;  I am using it for its original purpose which is to fully empty a container of its contents; thereby, eliminating waste.  Being male I do not use makeup, however I do use sunscreen being that I live in Southern California.  This item was one of the few that I have purchased that did exactly what was advertised.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> These are great! I miss that they are no longer called &amp;#34;Spatty and Spatty Daddy as introduced on Shark Tank. I guess other ladies might not find them as appealing. They are good for so many small spaces and bottles.</li>
            <li> Love the concept but was looking for something that would fit into a lipstick gloss tube. This product is too thick.</li>
            <li> Now I can get every bit of lotion or makeup out of bottles and jars.  Great idea!</li>
            <li> mother loved it! the small one is used daily</li>
            <li> The product is fantastic! Being frugal, I feel validated every time I am getting out that last bit of lotion, face cream, or whatever using the Spatty or Spatty Daddy. I highly recommend them!&lt;br /&gt;NH</li>
            <li> I was so excited about seeing these on Shark Tank. It&#x27;s a great idea and a great prototype but needs more fine turning. I would want it to be more flexible. It is too hard and stiff and won&#x27;t move well inside bottle so it just won&#x27;t scrape the sides like you need it too. Hoping to try it again with future improvements.</li>
            <li> Very useful Tools. I was shocked to see how much product I have wasted up to this point.  the handles are perfect for reaching into those long neck jars.</li>
            <li> I just love these. Waited so long to order them after the owner of the company was on Shark Tank.  No more wasting product. But will not fit into lipgloss tubes.  There is one for that though</li>
            <li> this makes deporting products so much easier.  i haven&#x27;t use the large one but the small one is very handy for deporting cream products</li>
            <li> Saw her on Shark Tank and couldn&#x27;t wait to get her product.  This product is well made and perfect for the job, no matter what is stuck in the bottom of the container.  I have used the small one to get the rest of the product out of a lip stick tube.  The large one for the bottom of the lotion bottle - I am able to get several weeks of lotion that otherwise would have gone in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Product!!!</li>
            <li> Never forgot the name when it was pitched on Shark Tank, then I came to bottom of a $100 glass, face cream jar I couldn&#x27;t reach. Bought Spatty and it worked like a dream!!! Very sturdy materials should last a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s remarkable how much product we throw out when we think our tube or bottle is &amp;#34;empty&amp;#34;.  I cut my tube of face wash in half and scraped out several more weeks worth of product, which really makes the Spatty pay for itself.</li>
            <li> Saw this first on Shark Tank, and it&#x27;s a great idea. Worked wonders in the first few days of use.</li>
            <li> Instead of throwing away what is left of makeup, esp. foundation/concealer at the bottom of a small glass bottle, use these...gonna save at least 50 bucks per year!</li>
            <li> Product is good quality, I am not using it quite as much as I thought I would but it has come in handy when I have.</li>
            <li> finally able to get every last drop of lotion out of jar of high end hand lotion that I bought</li>
            <li> I have a small container of eye moisturizer that is really expensive I bought these for.  I am able to get most of the contents out using the smallest spatty in this pack.  It is a cost saver for sure.  I haven&#x27;t used the big one yet but I&#x27;m sure it is going to come in handy at some point.  These are great to have around the house!</li>
            <li> These mini spatulas both work really well and I use them all the time. Have had for several months now and no problems with them coming apart. Really glad I got them.</li>
            <li> I used  these  spatty &#x27;s  to get  the remaining shampoo out of the bottle and they really  work  good. Don&#x27;t  hesitate to buy them you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Just a little disappointed on the price mark-up here. I just purchased this product from thespatty.com, the original website. Although I love Amazon, and buy almost everything on here, I also like to see what&#x27;s offered on the original product website. It sells for $10.99/set for the spatty and spatty daddy. Shipping is very reasonable at only $2.50. I just ordered 4 sets for $46.46. It&#x27;s like I got one free. Be diligent and cross check the prices so you get the best deal.</li>
            <li> wow what a help these have been. Love them&lt;br /&gt;Joan</li>
            <li> These really work!  Highly recommend to anyone who wants to get the most out of their makeup bottle or any container.  Thank You!</li>
            <li> Gave me weeks more use out of expensive cosmetic products. Recommended it to my friends and any one else I knew who was tired of throwing out unused product that you can se at the bottom of the container and can&#x27;t get to!</li>
            <li> Saw it on Shark Tank and it was just what I needed.  Use it for my face cream even if the jar is full, so that the cream doesn&#x27;t go under my fingernails.</li>
            <li> This product is great for getting those last drops of product out of a bottle that otherwise would have been thrown away. The Spatty saves money in the long run, especially on those expensive face creams. I&#x27;m so happy this product exists!</li>
            <li> Saw this on Shark Tank. Handy product.</li>
            <li> Perfect for what I need to get at those hard to reach places in jars, etc.  Yes, I not only recommend them but will be purchasing more -- maybe as gifts.</li>
            <li> Great product -- only wish I had thought of it. Very imaginative name</li>
            <li> It does help get out the stuff at the bottom of the containers but it&#x27;s still very messy to use.</li>
            <li> Does the job of getting every last drop of a product. Will fit most bottles except very narrow openings.</li>
            <li> You really can get every last drop. I Wish I would&#x27;ve had this years ago. I bought one for my mom too. I think every one should have a set!</li>
            <li> The spatty daddy set is essential for those who want to get the &amp;#34;last drop&amp;#34; from all sorts of containers.  I love them and have wanted to own a set since I saw them on Shark Tank.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves it. She uses it all the time. And know her makeup last longer.</li>
            <li> These Spattys have already paid for themselves by getting every last bit of liquid out of my expensive makeup and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I put sunscreen in travel bottles for our flight down to Florida.  It is hard to get all the contents out of them and the Little Spatty worked fine.  The large one is easily large enough for large lotion bottles I have at home.  Felt sturdy when i used it.  .  Love that they are dishwasher safe.</li>
            <li> I HATE keeping (shampoo, hand lotion, etc) bottles upside down to try to get the (sometimes significant amount of) product left when the pump stops working.  These little spatulas let me swipe easily, getting the rest in usable amounts until the container is either fully empty or nearly so (depending on shape).  I was brought up not to waste, so whether used to add the remaining product to a fuller bottle or to use, I think these are terrific.</li>
            <li> I wanted this product for the use it is designed.&lt;br /&gt;The box packaging Amazon used was excessive material.  It was disturbing that an item such as this had to be put into a box at all.  A mailer, a padded mailer would have been perfect.&lt;br /&gt;What a waste of resources, money and din on the environment.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a present for makeup retention....getting those last few drops from the bottle.  But when I gave it for a present, the recipient was using it for getting the last drops of mustard and other small neck grocery items.  Surprised me.  So I bought another set for the kitchen. Love them!  Saw on Shark Tank and really impressed with how they operate.</li>
            <li> This is the bomb!  It is just the thing for getting every bit of makeup, lotion, etc., from the bottom of the bottle without having to throw it out and wasting product.  One set should be used for non-food items, and another set to use in the kitchen with foodstuff.  This is a great product!</li>
            <li> These little spatulas help you to make your make up and moisturizer last WAY longer. You will be amazed at how much is really left in a bottle when you think it is empty.  Reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li> This is a great idea. Perfect for my lotions and makeup containers.  I had a bottle of lotion that I could not get the bottom of the bottle out unless I cut the bottle open.  Spatty let me get all of my lotion, saving me money.&lt;br /&gt; Everyone should have this!</li>
            <li> There is no more wasted product at the bottom of jars or bottles anymore thanks to the Spatty!  Great invention!  I first saw this invention presented on the television program &amp;#34;Shark Tank&amp;#34; and was so glad to see that it was offered on the Amazon web site.</li>
            <li> It is a great product and really does the job.Saves a lot of cosmetics and is quality material and design</li>
            <li> I love this product, it really shows you how much waste there is when you think you have used all that is in the bottle, then you use your spatty and see just how much more is left.  I really am glad I saw this presentation on Shark Tank, I also really liked the creator and I wish her and her family much success.</li>
            <li> This is a cool product, really has help me get the last drop of everything. I see these as stocking stuffers for my family in the future!</li>
            <li> Received product. It was not the product in this photo. It arrived in a clear plastic bag.The product had flat edges where the spatula (pink part) was suppose to be angled (to scrape edges of bottles). The spatula was almost as thick as it was wide. It did not scoop the product out of the bottle. The spatula was very hard and was not flexible at all.&lt;br /&gt;The Spatty Pair that I received later as a gift (not from amazon) did come with the pink cardboard and plastic packaging and the product was completely different.</li>
            <li> I love this set! Finally, no more wasting good product! The 2 sizes are perfect and durable. Love it! Everyone should have a set of these.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK - have used it maybe one time, so it seems like something you need / want / will use - but NO.  Maybe one day I will be very happy that I bought these two &amp;#34;mini-spatulas,&amp;#34; but so far I have discovered that I don&#x27;t really have much of a need for them!</li>
            <li> Works well,  I can get quite a bit more product out of the container by using these.  I wish the handle was more flexible, though.  It is a little tough to get into the angled edges of bottles.</li>
            <li> that what it is just ok.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product! I was able to use my expensive Chanel foundation for 2 more weeks because the spatty helped me get every last drop.</li>
            <li> I really wanted something to use for lip gloss tubes and the 6&amp;#34; in too large for that purpose.  They are OK for other things but not for my primary reason to purchase.  The article I read about the spatty lead me to believe they&#x27;d work in lip gloss tubes.  I bought several for gifts as well as for myself.  Big mistake.</li>
            <li> Saves money by getting ALL of the product out of the containers...love these!</li>
            <li> These are great, and save lots of money. I can now get every last drop of my makeup out of the bottles and tubes</li>
            <li> Better price when purchased as a set.&lt;br /&gt;I got an extra month out of my make up bottles (3) by using the 6&amp;#34; spatty&lt;br /&gt;The 12&amp;#34; I just stored away, would be nice to have 2-6&amp;#34; in a set.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> We originally saw these on Shark Tank and thought it was a good idea. They work as advertised and my wife loves being able to get the last little bit out of her girly stuff. The way prices are these days it pays for itself in a short while.</li>
            <li> This product really does get into every small little place thus saving you the product you can not seem to get out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> didnt work as good as I thought</li>
            <li> I loved the spatty idea when I saw it on Shark Tank. Told myself i am getting some of those. Ordered extra for Christmas presents. The only thing I have negative to say is how it does not clean up well with soap and water. I&#x27;m not sure if it is the material it is made out of or what. I used it to get the rest of my liquid makeup out of the bottom of the bottle and difficulty cleaning the stick on the spatty. Other that that LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> AMAZING!!!! I saw her on Shark Tank and I was so excited when I found this on Amazon!!! It&#x27;s everything &amp; more!! I&#x27;ve told all my friends about Spatty!! This little thing will save me $1,000&#x27;s!!</li>
            <li> Too big for any make up or small dispenser</li>
            <li> I despise wasting products so these are perfect for smaller cosmetic jars, tubes, etc. I use both sizes quite often - the smaller one is great for sample size tubes. I usually scrape what&#x27;s left of tubes (a lot of times several more uses) and put into a small plastic cosmetic pot with a lid, or secure the opening with a clothespin. And these make my frugality easier. Five stars because they are also sturdy and seem to be well-made. If you are a cosmetic junkie like me you need these in your life.</li>
            <li> I have not had a chance to use either one yet but now I have them and when I get low on my make up, I won&#x27;t have to worry.  I&#x27;ll them right here to use.  I loved the idea of them the minute I saw them on Shark Tank.  I&#x27;m going to get some for my daughter&#x27;s for Christmas.  Great stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li> Works good at getting to the bottom, no waste! Awesome</li>
            <li> I was excited about this product but it was not what I expected. The handle is too wide, especially for the small one, and it does not even fit in my small make up bottles as promised. The spatula itself is too narrow on both and it does not do the job of reaching the spots where the residual staff accumulates inside the containers. To me, useless</li>
            <li> Very useful and lets me use all the product.</li>
            <li> I cannot live without these.  I use them on a regular basis to get makeup or cream out of bottles.  I didn&#x27;t  know that I was throwing away so much products in bottles until I started using spatty daddy.  I use the 6 inch more.  I save $$$$$ by using spatty daddy rather than throwing away the bottles with products still in them that I could not get out.  The shipping was fast.  Order these, you will really use these!!!!</li>
            <li> I have long fingernails and this allows me to take out exactly the amount I need without getting it under my nails.  I love it.  It&#x27;s a great idea!</li>
            <li> I saw this darling, super enthusiastic young lady on Shark Tank!!! Loved her idea! They told her to try and sell it to Avon. I&#x27;m so glad to see she got it out there!!!!! I wish her continued success!</li>
            <li> even slimmer would be nice.</li>
            <li> Good size and quality.</li>
            <li> does what it is supposed to do just not sure how much I will actually use it. However it works well and is easy to use..</li>
            <li> I love the way I can get all the cream out of my bottles with this spatula.  No more wasted creams thrown away.  One of the most savings items I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> I have quite the accessory stash in my bathroom. A LeCreuset silicone spatula, mini spoons, mini scrapers and even ice cream taster spoons.  Upon receiving these spatulas, washing and drying them, I used them to scrap face cream, foundation and lipstick out of several small containers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is a semi-stiff white plastic sized a bit like a MacDonald&#x27;s straw on the large spatula.  The actual head is made of rubber and while the rubber material is very pliable, the white stick part goes down far enough because of the small size that the overall effect is a bit stiff.  It works but I was hoping the tip would be a bit more flexible (like LeCreuset) to get past tight spaces of the bottle neck and really move the creams and lotions out of the bottle.  As the head is small and stiff, it does take time to move stuff out as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Large spatty:&lt;br /&gt;White-coloured stick part measures 10.5\\&quot;, pink rubber tip measures approximately 1.5\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Small spatty:&lt;br /&gt;White-coloured stick part measures 5 3/8\\&quot;, pink rubber tip measures 5/8\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall impression is that it&#x27;s OK, but I&#x27;m still looking for something better for the shapes of bottles I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this Spatty set directly from the manufacturer via a deal site.</li>
            <li> After years of banging lotion bottles, the spatty makes it so easy to get every drop.  The small one is great for the liquid makeup and lipsticks too!</li>
            <li> IT WAS A SMALL ADD ON GIFT...TOO FUNNY THEY LOVED IT.  I GUESS BOTTLES LOW ON LOTION DRIVE THE HUSBAND CRAZY!</li>
            <li> This is the answer to getting the last drop out of jars and small bottles. I bought the regular Spatty and Spatty Daddy (pair), so I always have the right size spatula to avoid wasting product. A really neat invention. The small size is perfect for makeup bottles or other small bottles. The large is great for larger jars or bottles, like narrow mustard containers. The Spatty Daddy measures 11 7/8  with the spatula part 1 3/8 inches long by 5/8 inches wide, while the smaller Spatty measures 6 inches with a spatula part a hair under 5/8 inches long by 3/8 inches wide. The spatula has similar flexibility to a regular rubber spatula, maybe a little more rigid, but much smaller to fit into tighter spaces.</li>
            <li> Lot of product gets thrown away until I made this purchase</li>
            <li> Package that was to contain two items only contained the large spatty. a definite rip-off</li>
            <li> Whoever invented this is a genius, so simple, but so needed. Used the small spatula on a bottle of face cream, was surprised that there was about 1/2 inch of product left in the bottle. Not anymore I am able to scoop all of it out.</li>
            <li> I love these two make-up/lotion spatulas.  They have paid for themselves within a few months.  The small one works for face lotions and makeup.  The longer one works for conditioner, shampoo and body lotions.  Perfectly shaped to really get things out of a bottle or jar.</li>
            <li> Great, great and great.....................wish I had thought of it....</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with the Spatty Pair.  I have use the small one almost every day and love it.  They are well made and the larger one will be good to dig deep for those last bits of hard to get at products.  I would like to have a mid size spatty if they make them.</li>
            <li> Love them I buy a product in a pump bottle that i never get the last of it out. Now that I found these i get to use all of my lotion Bought them as stocking stuffers for the girls for christmas.</li>
            <li> This is the only one of many of the spatulas that fits into a very small chanel makeup bottle.  It&#x27;s a little firmer than I&#x27;d like, but it does the job well.  The big one is great for lotions like nivea which have tall bottles with pumps that don&#x27;t reach all the way to the bottom.</li>
            <li> I really like and use this product. I have bought several of them for the girls in the family and they think they are very handy and just love them. Thanks so much</li>
            <li> As described.  The longest one, I trimmed a bit  so it would fit in the container I needed it for.  Trimmed up easily w/ scissors.</li>
            <li> I was just getting to the bottom of a jar of face moisturizer and a large bottle of body lotion when I received these in the mail.  (I actually had 5 other almost empty lotion bottles sitting around that I could not bring myself to throw away, as well.)  Can you say.... Awesome!!  As expensive as products are these days, I&#x27;m not throwing away a single drop of my hard earned money.  This Spatty set has already paid for itself.  Trust me on that!  And I don&#x27;t have to risk slicing myself when cutting open bottles like I use to.  Gave a set to my sister as a stocking stuffer.....she loved it!  We had actually seen the pitch on &#x27;Shark Tank&#x27; and could not wait to buy it.  Simple concept.....but genius.  The 12 inch one works great for my 32oz bottles.  Use it like you would a regular spatula, scrape and scoop.  Easy peasy.</li>
            <li> These are kinda thick for a spatula and that makes it hard to get stuff out with them. They need to be thinner.</li>
            <li> I use clarins liquid makeup which is fairly expensive and there is always some left in the bottom and the small spatty gets it out. Clarins lasts forever but now it lasts forever and days.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!! Item as described. Fast shipping...</li>
            <li> Gave as gifts my gifts were well liked. My wife really was glad to see product on market and she showed our daughter how it could be used.</li>
            <li> These are awesome to get the last amounts out of those expensive toiletries and makeup containers. Will pay for themselves very quickly.</li>
            <li> Love my spatties.  I use them often.  Far superior to the methods I used before to extract what is left in lotion bottles.  I can&#x27;t stand to just throw away perfectly good product just because it is difficult to reach.  I used to cut open the bottles, but spatty make this unnecessary.  I can now recycle bottles without having sharp cut edges to them.  Thank you to that young woman inventor who appeared on Shark Tank.  If I had been a rich investor, I would have helped you along.  Great idea, great product.</li>
            <li> I had ordered a set and I was so pleased with it I ordered a set for a Christmas present. It is amazing how much product you are throwing away. Do yourself a favor and get a set.</li>
            <li> Girlfirend loves these. Gets all the makeup out of her little bottles.</li>
            <li> What a great product.  This is going onto my Christmas present list for all my family members next year.  It paid for itself right away.</li>
            <li> Fits into lotion jars but would be more efficient if it were spoon shaped.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these! Can&#x27;t believe how much product I was wasting before.</li>
            <li> Works great! Really does save you money!</li>
            <li> I wanted this to fit inside a lipstick sponge tube. So not finding a use for it at the moment. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Love the product.  Unfortunately, should come with a disclaimer to not leave it in the jar/tube/bottle for any length of time as my spatty has now disintegrated and is the consistency of bubblegum--already chewed.</li>
            <li> OMG I wish I had discovered these things years ago!  I hate wasting expensive, or even inexpensive, lotions, cleansers and cosmetics and had struggled for years with shaking, squeezing and funneling containers to try and remove every last drop.  These simple little spatulas make it so easy to extract all of the product out of the container.  I love them!  They are particularly helpful for skin lotion that comes in a pump bottle - it&#x27;s usually next to impossible to get it all out when it gets low.  Also stiff bottles such as Proactiv face wash are easily defeated with the Spatty, as well as foundation that comes in jars.  I love that there are two different sizes.  The inventor of the Spatty deserves a Nobel prize.</li>
            <li> Size not what expected- she saw it on shark tank the tools are much larger</li>
            <li> Great, it was exactly as ordered and exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Would recommend to others. I may buy some additional spattys for Christmas gifts. I love this great product.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as promised. I could not find this in the store and have waited patiently for it. When it showed up on Amazon, I jumped at it!</li>
            <li> Product came fast and as expected. Just as I thought it would be. Saw this on SharkTank and my mom really wanted one.</li>
            <li> Great idea! works well.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Wife loves it, uses it pretty much everyday.  Nothing else to really say.  No complaints at all.</li>
            <li> I get a few more days  out of every squeeze bottle and it is good to the last drop.  Must have for all lotions</li>
            <li> Just as described! Got two, gave one as a gift and kept one for myself. Great product! Very Happy with purchase!</li>
            <li> I bought this as I have a large bottle of  expensive lotion. This is the 1st time I have been able to get the bottle actually cleaned out.</li>
            <li> I had to buy a Spatty for my mother and it came with a larger Spatty &amp;#34;Spatty Daddy&amp;#34; for my shampoos and conditioners! This is a lifesaver for those on a tight budget!</li>
            <li> Great product and saves money. I first saw this on Shark Tank. I have used different methods to obtain products from the bottom of their containers. This works great.</li>
            <li> Has saved a lot of product for use on my body instead of the garbage....like miniature bowl scrapers. Bled is pliable enough to get the last drop.</li>
            <li> This is such an amazing device. I can get the last drop out of the bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheryl</li>
            <li> Works just like advertised. She uses all the time and loves it. Great stocking stuffer. She has gotten 10 more uses out of makeup she otherwise would have tossed</li>
            <li> I love these.  I love that I can get the last bit of moisturizer out of the jar that I couldn&#x27;t before. Awesome idea!</li>
            <li> The small one works well to scrape out the last of foundation or moisturizer left in the bottle.</li>
            <li> It takes the product out so it does work, but it gets really messy on the handle which i hate! I have to wipe it off everytime i use it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have it yet but I saw it on shark tank and thought how stupid they were to not get in on it.  I wanted one immediately I also see there are already knock offs.  I however will only order this one.  I can&#x27;t wait to get mine</li>
            <li> I just received these and I&#x27;m so excited to have them. I saw them on Shark Tank and I thought, what a great idea and I could have used these so many times. Why didn&#x27;t I think of this??? A very smart young lady actually did it! My hat is off to her and I&#x27;m giving some out for Christmas. Just a wonderful idea with so many uses!!! What a great way to save some money in the future! I&#x27;ve saved some perfect little jars for the little gold mines I&#x27;ll come up with.</li>
            <li> Here is the way things work with my expensive makeup - I get to the end of the jar and can&#x27;t get it out and I&#x27;m determined each morning to waste an incredible amount of time beating the container against things to get it out, or trying not to over-dump what accumulated when it was upside down. Big waste of time. Just got these spattys in the mail last week. I have a base primer bottle with an opening that is 3/8in (the diameter is larger, I&#x27;m not counting the thickness of the bottle, just the opening - 3/8in).  The small spatty fits in great, washes off quickly and done!  Wish I&#x27;d had this for the last 20 years.</li>
            <li> Great idea and well packagesd.  Just as expected and described</li>
            <li> Also, good for small gift items. I use mine with my make-up containers. I am going to get me another set for my kitchen.</li>
            <li> Pays for itself in a few uses, we get all the lotion out of the bottle now.</li>
            <li> Love these little spatulas. The small one is perfect for makeup jars. I can see these as perfect stocking stuffers!</li>
            <li> This product pays for it&#x27;s self, no more waste with expensive cosmetic products.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for my cosmetic bottles. Works exactly as expected, received it quickly and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I love getting the last drop out of a product and these do it, especially the smaller one,</li>
            <li> Great invention!  I&#x27;m able to use all my product that is in pump lotion bottles and nothing goes to waste</li>
            <li> Name change &amp; packaging need a boost! Product is ok but pricey!</li>
