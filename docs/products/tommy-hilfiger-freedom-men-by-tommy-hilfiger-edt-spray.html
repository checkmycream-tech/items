            <li> EXCELENTE PERFUME. ES EL QUE ESPERABA. LLEGO EN PERFECTAS CONDICIONES A VENEZUELA. NO DUDARE EN VOLVERLO A PEDIR. LO RECOMIENDO.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what my husband was looking for.</li>
            <li> I remember smelling this cologne one day a long time ago and I always enjoyed the scent. Not many men wear this cologne because it is a bit older, so it will be unique and can almost be your signature scent. It is not overpowering and compliments the body very nicely. I would recommend this to anyone that asked me. I bought two bottles so I will always have a backup.</li>
            <li> The product is as expected&lt;br /&gt;This item is OK, I like it&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to everybody&lt;br /&gt;This product is good quality</li>
            <li> This fragrance is just plain wonderful and sexy. I have been routinely complemented on my perfume choice.  The aroma is classy, not too heavy and excellent for any occasion. It smells like a mix of cucumbers with sandalwood and spices. Its very unique and one of a kind. I rarely review fragrances but this one deserves solid 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The item was a little different as shown in the picture, but it was the same as in the description. The shipping was on time.</li>
            <li> i bouth this perfume because i tought it was the original old bottle but what a surprise i get the new one. i saw the same for the same price but the double 3.4 oz .</li>
            <li> Is not the real frangance....!</li>

            <li> excellent product, I expected,</li>
            <li> Gracias, el perfumen llego a mis mano rapido, muy buen perfume, gracias al vendedor.</li>
            <li> My favorite &amp; my wife&#x27;s, too.</li>
            <li> They changed the package, is not the same as in this picture, even the smell is not the same. I still have the old one which is better and different than I bought it recently.</li>
            <li> The items came within the delivery date period.  This cologne is my all-time favorite.  My spouse really loves the smell.  However, for a discontinued product like this, I would expect to pay less.  Shipping charge is also pricey.</li>
