            <li>I liked it</li>

            <li>Very easy to install.  </li>
            <li>The instructions are very easy to follow.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased with the one I ordered for my own 2 bathroom</li>
            <li>These seem to be perfect so far.</li>
            <li>These really would be ideal to install when you have kids, for elderly people for safety, or you have a son that insists on sitting on the lid to put his socks on.  </li>
            <li>OK, that might be an exaggeration, but I feel very strongly about this.</li>

            <li>My wife is pleased about how sturdy the seat now feels, and that&#x27;s what matters most.</li>
            <li>The best structures built always start with a solid foundation.  </li>
            <li>Also, I should&#x27;ve bought these when Amazon had these as free-shipping &#x27;add-ons&#x27; because I paid $7.24 each, after shipping charges added, which was more than the cost of the seat they&#x27;re attached to.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased wirh my purchase</li>
            <li>Installing these does take a bit more work, but using the rubber band alignment idea helps a lot.</li>
            <li>I even wrote the company to complement them on the innovative installation method.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t tackled putting these on because drilling holes need to be done, will wait to make sure I want to use them..</li>
            <li>Wished more info had been put in the online description.  </li>
            <li>This is a very handy invention for modern society.</li>

            <li>/&gt;There could be some better instructions and \\&quot;templates\\&quot; provided to place them properly, but otherwise, they are very good.</li>
            <li>The Compac Safe-T-Bumpers were relatively easy to install.</li>

            <li>I used these to raise the front of the toilet seat after installing a bidet and they work great, easy to install and adjust</li>
            <li>provided a snugger fit for bidet</li>
            <li>Keeps the seat secure.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Especially helpful for people with disabilities that need a secure and stable seat.</li>
            <li>It does the job fabulously.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive and practical indispensable bathroom accessory.</li>
            <li>This is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I also ordered from Amazon at the same time, &amp;#34;Toilet Seat Stoppers&amp;#34; and work great for my purpose.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They were relatively easy to install and the price was right!  </li>
            <li>This is really a necessity for the commode seat, no more wiggling ever.&lt;br /&gt;Great product and great Amazon service, great price.</li>
            <li>These are so great for stabilizing the toilet seat.</li>
            <li>This product is very easy to install, and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>They are easy to install and well worth the money.</li>
            <li>and the price is right!  </li>
            <li>Stable is the right word!  </li>
            <li>They installed quickly and easily and solved the&lt;br /&gt;problem of the shifting seat right away.</li>
            <li>great product, but you have to be careful not to over tighten because the screw tip can hurt the user thighs</li>
            <li>Stops the wobble, super sturdy.  </li>
            <li>put these on the guest bathroom toilet seat and worked good.</li>
            <li>These little gadgets work great and solved one of my biggest pet peeves.</li>
            <li>I bought the new seats because they were one piece (easier to clean) , and had a nice soft-return action-</li>
            <li>Not only is this arrangement WAY more comfortable, the hinge assembly is no longer threatened by my weight and shiftiness.</li>
            <li>I see they are now available for as low as $2.68 + $2 shipping, or $5.02 as an add-on item, a much better price for these.</li>
            <li>Have to be handy with a drill to install, only drawback, but hubby had no problem.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>This item is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth the money and lasts for years.</li>
            <li>they were worth a try.</li>
            <li>Simple but effective.</li>
            <li>These little bumpers very effectively prevent the seat from sliding from side to side, and thereby prevent undue stress and strain on the connection to the toilet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is best to start with a clean or new toilet seat, and connect the bumpers to the toilet seat with the included rubber band.</li>
            <li>seat stays right where it is supposed to be, centered over the bowl</li>
            <li>If you own a toilet seat that slips sideways this is the solution.  </li>
            <li>Such great excitement from something so simple and inexpensive.</li>
            <li>These thingies absolutely solve the problem!</li>
            <li>The first set took about 10 minutes</li>
            <li>&#x27;s that I bought several more for my children&#x27;s home&#x27;s and for a select group of friend&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>These really work!  </li>
            <li>Dimensions of each bracket: - Length of side with screw holes: 4.5cm (1.75&amp;#34;); - Height: 3cm (1.25&amp;#34;); - Width: 1.7cm (0.75&amp;#34;)&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>If it fits yor toilet seat you are buying a great product specially when overweight people use your toiletes.&lt;br /&gt;No more broken seats.</li>
            <li>they are great for heavy or very young or handicapt.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something to help keep the toilet seat from slipping around and this works BEAUTIFULLY</li>
            <li>What can I say other than that it works nicely.</li>
            <li>How many times have you sat on the toilet and the seat slips to one side?</li>
            <li>Why toilet seat manufacturers do not include seat stabilizers, I will never know; but I am sure that in some unrecognizable way, this invention has saved my life.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My toilet seats have not had to be readjusted or tightened since we installed them more than a year ago.</li>
            <li>I have had so many toilet seats break at the hinges just from leaning a bit while on the seat..</li>
            <li>These work great to stabilize a loose toilet seat.  </li>
            <li>Safe for younger and older members to use also.</li>
            <li>The seat my builders installed does not have a very secure mounting and would work itself loose over time.  </li>
            <li>This item is so simple and so easy to install.  </li>
            <li>When it loosens, it will allow more movement, and so on, until finally it is so loose that it&#x27;s unsafe, and you wind up replacing the whole seat.</li>
            <li>It is very easy (relatively) to attach to the toilet seat and it mostly guarantees that the seat does not slide back and forth.  </li>
            <li>Works great for keeping toilet seats in place and not sliding all over the place when you sit down.</li>
            <li>It is nice to sit down and have the toiley seat move!</li>
            <li>/&gt;You know how it is when you are finishing up the job.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes the seat wants to slide off of the bowl.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Finally a product that keeps the commode seat secure.</li>
            <li>Simple to secure.  </li>
            <li>Lock the seat in position very well.</li>
            <li>They work really</li>
            <li>Installation is much simpler than I</li>
            <li>My son sits on the lid to put his socks on when he gets dressed after taking his shower and ends up loosening the whole seat from sitting on it.  </li>
            <li>bag.will be more careful about return policy.</li>
            <li>Very stable.</li>
            <li>They really do stop the rocking of the seat.  </li>
            <li>It really works, stops the seat from sliding around,</li>
            <li>These are a little bit touchy to install properly, but once in place, they are very effective.</li>
            <li>Yes these little bumpers work great, wish we would have found them 3 toilet seat ago.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing for keeping your wooden toilet seat from sliding around.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally discuss bathroom issues, but it is very unnerving to slide sideways while taking care of business.</li>
            <li>Yes those t bumpers did the trick, they are awesome, no more slip and hopefully no more trips to the hardware store to fix the seat bolts...  </li>
            <li>Quick &amp; painless to install and haven&#x27;t looked back since.  </li>
            <li>Even high quality seats become lose sometimes, and I have used these bumpers for years to keep the seat stable and non moving when in ue.</li>
            <li>For elderly and disabled - and children that perform odd gymnastics on a toilet seat… THIS IS A MAGNIFICENT STABILIZER!  </li>
            <li>The product makes the toilet safe for those who are handicapped so that the toilet seat does not move when trying to take care of the paper work and sitting and rising the seat does not move causing embalance of the person.</li>
            <li>may come back and try if I can&#x27;t find any other suitable alternative.</li>
            <li>We were using more toilet seats than toilet paper!  </li>
            <li>you need a new seat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We had to order these after we bought two new commodes and found nothing that would stabilize the seats.</li>
            <li>We need a new bidet for master bathroom</li>
            <li>I was having to buy new ones monthly.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>sometimes the small things resolve the most aggravating problems.</li>
            <li>It would be easier just to buy a new toilet seat, which is exactly what I am going to end up doing.</li>
            <li>These things do exactly what they are supposed to do - keep the toilet seat from sliding from side to side.  </li>
            <li>the installation, while a little more involved than opening a can of beans, was still much easier than I expected.</li>
            <li>For a novice instruction were not as clear as they could be</li>
            <li>I fixed two seats.</li>
            <li>and yet they really make a big difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Eventually that action breaks the seat hinges.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>much needed accessory that everyone needs.&lt;br /&gt;Can be used over and over on different seats.</li>
            <li>harder to put on than other options that lock in the screws, plus presents one more thing that needs cleaning/disinfecting.</li>
            <li>unfortunately they just don&#x27;t fit right!  </li>
            <li>And now I also don&#x27;t have to worry about my small grand kids pinching tiny fingers when getting on and off.</li>
            <li>Easy to install and takes only a few minutes, I recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>These definitely do the trick on my new but poor-fitting seats.  </li>
            <li>Before this I tried new washers, specialized washers, but only this did the trick.</li>
            <li>I even bought new seat screws to have it only slip again.  </li>
            <li>These really should come standard with toilets or toilet seats.</li>
            <li>Because you have to screw these into the underside of your seat, I can&#x27;t consider my seats to be one piece any more (thus a little harder to clean), but no more sliding around!  </li>
            <li>When ever I change toilet seats I transfer these to the new one.  </li>
            <li>I have been searching for the right thing to stop the toilet seat from slipping.</li>
            <li>rim.&lt;br /&gt;No more broken hinges.</li>
            <li>So I had to move them around a few times until I got it in the right spot.</li>
            <li>This product eliminates the problem of the seat slipping or sliding from one side to another, which is only really a problem if you have an elongated seat.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The installation of these Safe-T-Bumpers was a little finicky, however it was not difficult.</li>
            <li>I installed these on my toilet seat some months ago and the seat is now stable and steady, even though the integrity of the seat hinges had already failed (likely due to certain of my physical characteristics which won&#x27;t be detailed here).</li>
            <li>I really like these -- they should be required on all plastic seats that seem to slide from side to side after a little use.</li>
            <li>My new toilet seat kept on slipping to one side.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I was so pleased with the one I ordered for my own 2 bathroom</li>
            <li> These seem to be perfect so far.</li>
            <li> These really would be ideal to install when you have kids, for elderly people for safety, or you have a son that insists on sitting on the lid to put his socks on.  </li>
            <li> OK, that might be an exaggeration, but I feel very strongly about this.</li>

            <li> The best structures built always start with a solid foundation.  </li>
            <li> Also, I should&#x27;ve bought these when Amazon had these as free-shipping &#x27;add-ons&#x27; because I paid $7.24 each, after shipping charges added, which was more than the cost of the seat they&#x27;re attached to.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased wirh my purchase</li>
            <li> Installing these does take a bit more work, but using the rubber band alignment idea helps a lot.</li>

            <li> Haven&#x27;t tackled putting these on because drilling holes need to be done, will wait to make sure I want to use them..</li>

            <li> They installed quickly and easily and solved the&lt;br /&gt;problem of the shifting seat right away.</li>
            <li> great product, but you have to be careful not to over tighten because the screw tip can hurt the user thighs</li>
            <li> Stops the wobble, super sturdy.  </li>
            <li> put these on the guest bathroom toilet seat and worked good.</li>
            <li> These little gadgets work great and solved one of my biggest pet peeves.</li>
            <li> I bought the new seats because they were one piece (easier to clean) , and had a nice soft-return action-</li>
            <li> Not only is this arrangement WAY more comfortable, the hinge assembly is no longer threatened by my weight and shiftiness.</li>
            <li> I see they are now available for as low as $2.68 + $2 shipping, or $5.02 as an add-on item, a much better price for these.</li>
            <li> Have to be handy with a drill to install, only drawback, but hubby had no problem.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This item is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth the money and lasts for years.</li>
            <li> they were worth a try.</li>
            <li> Simple but effective.</li>
            <li> These little bumpers very effectively prevent the seat from sliding from side to side, and thereby prevent undue stress and strain on the connection to the toilet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is best to start with a clean or new toilet seat, and connect the bumpers to the toilet seat with the included rubber band.</li>
            <li> seat stays right where it is supposed to be, centered over the bowl</li>
            <li> If you own a toilet seat that slips sideways this is the solution.  </li>
            <li> Such great excitement from something so simple and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> These thingies absolutely solve the problem!</li>
            <li> The first set took about 10 minutes</li>
            <li> &#x27;s that I bought several more for my children&#x27;s home&#x27;s and for a select group of friend&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> These really work!  </li>
            <li> Dimensions of each bracket: - Length of side with screw holes: 4.5cm (1.75&amp;#34;); - Height: 3cm (1.25&amp;#34;); - Width: 1.7cm (0.75&amp;#34;)&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> If it fits yor toilet seat you are buying a great product specially when overweight people use your toiletes.&lt;br /&gt;No more broken seats.</li>
            <li> they are great for heavy or very young or handicapt.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to help keep the toilet seat from slipping around and this works BEAUTIFULLY</li>
            <li> What can I say other than that it works nicely.</li>
            <li> How many times have you sat on the toilet and the seat slips to one side?</li>
            <li> Why toilet seat manufacturers do not include seat stabilizers, I will never know; but I am sure that in some unrecognizable way, this invention has saved my life.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My toilet seats have not had to be readjusted or tightened since we installed them more than a year ago.</li>
            <li> I have had so many toilet seats break at the hinges just from leaning a bit while on the seat..</li>
            <li> These work great to stabilize a loose toilet seat.  </li>
            <li> Safe for younger and older members to use also.</li>
            <li> The seat my builders installed does not have a very secure mounting and would work itself loose over time.  </li>
            <li> This item is so simple and so easy to install.  </li>
            <li> When it loosens, it will allow more movement, and so on, until finally it is so loose that it&#x27;s unsafe, and you wind up replacing the whole seat.</li>
            <li> It is very easy (relatively) to attach to the toilet seat and it mostly guarantees that the seat does not slide back and forth.  </li>
            <li> Works great for keeping toilet seats in place and not sliding all over the place when you sit down.</li>
            <li> It is nice to sit down and have the toiley seat move!</li>
            <li> /&gt;You know how it is when you are finishing up the job.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes the seat wants to slide off of the bowl.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Finally a product that keeps the commode seat secure.</li>
            <li> Simple to secure.  </li>
            <li> Lock the seat in position very well.</li>
            <li> They work really</li>
            <li> Installation is much simpler than I</li>
            <li> My son sits on the lid to put his socks on when he gets dressed after taking his shower and ends up loosening the whole seat from sitting on it.  </li>
            <li> bag.will be more careful about return policy.</li>
            <li> Very stable.</li>
            <li> They really do stop the rocking of the seat.  </li>
            <li> It really works, stops the seat from sliding around,</li>
            <li> These are a little bit touchy to install properly, but once in place, they are very effective.</li>
            <li> Yes these little bumpers work great, wish we would have found them 3 toilet seat ago.  </li>
            <li> This product is amazing for keeping your wooden toilet seat from sliding around.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally discuss bathroom issues, but it is very unnerving to slide sideways while taking care of business.</li>
            <li> Yes those t bumpers did the trick, they are awesome, no more slip and hopefully no more trips to the hardware store to fix the seat bolts...  </li>
            <li> Quick &amp; painless to install and haven&#x27;t looked back since.  </li>
            <li> Even high quality seats become lose sometimes, and I have used these bumpers for years to keep the seat stable and non moving when in ue.</li>
            <li> For elderly and disabled - and children that perform odd gymnastics on a toilet seat… THIS IS A MAGNIFICENT STABILIZER!  </li>
            <li> The product makes the toilet safe for those who are handicapped so that the toilet seat does not move when trying to take care of the paper work and sitting and rising the seat does not move causing embalance of the person.</li>
            <li> may come back and try if I can&#x27;t find any other suitable alternative.</li>
            <li> We were using more toilet seats than toilet paper!  </li>
            <li> you need a new seat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We had to order these after we bought two new commodes and found nothing that would stabilize the seats.</li>
            <li> We need a new bidet for master bathroom</li>
            <li> I was having to buy new ones monthly.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> sometimes the small things resolve the most aggravating problems.</li>
            <li> It would be easier just to buy a new toilet seat, which is exactly what I am going to end up doing.</li>
            <li> These things do exactly what they are supposed to do - keep the toilet seat from sliding from side to side.  </li>
            <li> the installation, while a little more involved than opening a can of beans, was still much easier than I expected.</li>
            <li> For a novice instruction were not as clear as they could be</li>
            <li> I fixed two seats.</li>
            <li> and yet they really make a big difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Eventually that action breaks the seat hinges.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> much needed accessory that everyone needs.&lt;br /&gt;Can be used over and over on different seats.</li>
            <li> harder to put on than other options that lock in the screws, plus presents one more thing that needs cleaning/disinfecting.</li>
            <li> unfortunately they just don&#x27;t fit right!  </li>
            <li> And now I also don&#x27;t have to worry about my small grand kids pinching tiny fingers when getting on and off.</li>
            <li> Easy to install and takes only a few minutes, I recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> These definitely do the trick on my new but poor-fitting seats.  </li>
            <li> Before this I tried new washers, specialized washers, but only this did the trick.</li>
            <li> I even bought new seat screws to have it only slip again.  </li>
            <li> These really should come standard with toilets or toilet seats.</li>
            <li> Because you have to screw these into the underside of your seat, I can&#x27;t consider my seats to be one piece any more (thus a little harder to clean), but no more sliding around!  </li>
            <li> When ever I change toilet seats I transfer these to the new one.  </li>
            <li> I have been searching for the right thing to stop the toilet seat from slipping.</li>
            <li> rim.&lt;br /&gt;No more broken hinges.</li>
            <li> So I had to move them around a few times until I got it in the right spot.</li>
            <li> This product eliminates the problem of the seat slipping or sliding from one side to another, which is only really a problem if you have an elongated seat.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The installation of these Safe-T-Bumpers was a little finicky, however it was not difficult.</li>
            <li> I installed these on my toilet seat some months ago and the seat is now stable and steady, even though the integrity of the seat hinges had already failed (likely due to certain of my physical characteristics which won&#x27;t be detailed here).</li>
            <li> I really like these -- they should be required on all plastic seats that seem to slide from side to side after a little use.</li>
            <li> My new toilet seat kept on slipping to one side.</li>
            <li> After going through several toilet seats, and getting tired of slipping and sliding off my perch, I knew that there had to be a better way.</li>
            <li> I recently had to replace the entire hinge assembly on the toilet seat as the shifting of the seat finally broke the hinge.  </li>
            <li> Are you tired of loose toilet seats?&lt;br /&gt;These inexpensive and easy to install devices will prevent your toilet seat from sliding sideways ever again and thus no loose seat bolts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These work very well to keep the toilet seat in place even with heavy use and larger people, even when you have to twist on the seat to reach toilet paper.</li>
            <li> What is it about toilet seats, especially those with plastic hinges, which skitter off-center?!  </li>
            <li> This simple fix for unstable toilet seat should be standard equipment on all toilet seats.</li>
            <li> you have people who weigh a lot using the toilet this is essential to keep the seat in place.  </li>
            <li> They should make this a standard feature on all toilet seats.</li>
            <li> It was not necessary to remove the toilet seat, there is no measuring required, nor do you have to use templates.</li>
            <li> But the manufacturer specifically states: &amp;#34;Suitable for all wooden toilet seats.</li>
            <li> My last set was installed on a friends toilet and she loves it also.</li>
            <li> I purchased (recently) a toilet set that said the bar on the back would keep the seat from moving around and they lied.</li>
            <li> I believe the seat underside has to be flat in order to mount these bumpers correctly.</li>
            <li> Finally you can lift the seat, and permanently attach the Safe-T-Bumpers with the included screws, as long as you don&#x27;t drop a screw in the water!</li>
            <li> They keep the toilet seat in place.  </li>
            <li> Bought one for each toilet.</li>
            <li> Amazon was so helpful in helping me find the toilet parts that I needed.</li>
            <li> No wiggly toilet seat</li>
            <li> This product prevents a toilet from seat sliding from side to side and breaking the plastic hinges.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this product, I have not had to purchase another toilet seat, or tighten the bolts connecting the seat.</li>
            <li> Now if i&#x27;m sitting on the toilet</li>
            <li> My brother sits sideways on the toilet so he can face the sink and smoke, and now he can do that without the seat cover shifting.</li>
            <li> It can be used for any toilet seat or shaped toilet bowl.  </li>
            <li> - we have one toilet which has a plastic seat with a concave underside to the seat, and I don&#x27;t think the bumpers can be mounted on it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for toilet seat stabilizers &amp; no one sells them.  </li>
            <li> If you have ever sat on a toilet seat that moves from side to side</li>
            <li> My toilet seat no longer slip and slide now</li>
            <li> It keeps the toilet seat from shifting when I transfer my paralyzed body onto the toilet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We have a water saver toilet with a plastic seat and lid.  </li>
            <li> My husband said there was no problem with the upstairs toilet</li>
            <li> The solution for creeping toilet seats THAT WORKS.</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t like the seat on the toilet to move.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who has a toilet.</li>
            <li> There is no doubt in my mind that when a toilet seat can move from side to side, it will, and over time that movement will loosen the seat&#x27;s connection to the toilet.</li>
            <li> Replaced the toilet and no matter how I tightened the bolts</li>
            <li> Keeps the toilet seat from sliding from side to side.</li>
            <li> the screws came all the way through the toilet seat.  </li>
            <li> But the toilet tool worked</li>
            <li> Have a sliding toilet seat?  </li>
            <li> I bought it with the Toilet Tool as I was determined to stop the slippage of my toilet seats at any cost!  </li>
            <li> My toilet seat wiggles no longer!</li>
            <li> This is a simple solution to an aggravating problem, a seat that keeps slipping from side to side.</li>
            <li> Over time, one bolt broke because of constant slipping (you’d tighten it up</li>
            <li> It is simple, easy to install yourself, and works as it should without disappointing.</li>
            <li> Next, set the seat down on the toilet bowl and adjust the bumpers so they sit within the bowl.</li>
            <li> this solved the moving toilet seat ... if you want to stop the slip and slid of your standard toilet seat, this little tab will stop any movement</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t stay on very long.</li>
            <li> I knew it would just break loose.  </li>
            <li> Love it, no more wobble of the toilet seat or being afraid of falling off the toilet seat &amp; hitting the floor.</li>
            <li> It takes a little caution not to drill too deep.</li>
            <li> and i need to reach down and pick up something from the floor or to pet my cat, the toilet seat doesn&#x27;t slide.</li>
            <li> I put them on two toilet seats in less than15 min.</li>
            <li> No longer have to worry about seats slipping and dumping guests.</li>
            <li> They be very small in size, good and bad in a way.</li>
            <li> A must have for those who limited mobility once they are sitting down.</li>
            <li> but once I knew the procedure  the other two sets took about 5 minutes each.</li>
            <li> Bought 2 packs, 1 of the bumpers was &#x27;softer&#x27; than the other 3.</li>
            <li> Not expensive or difficult to install.</li>
            <li> No more slide slipping with the toilet seat.  </li>
            <li> Finally, no more moving toilet seat.</li>
            <li> Bad, if you are using something like a Luxe Bidet, it raised the seat up some at the back and there is a fairly large gap.</li>
            <li> These did the trick and are a hidden gem.  </li>
            <li> No more crushed &#x27;bumpers&#x27;, or wobble.  </li>
            <li> IT also prevents the chance of a fall to those who have trouble getting up and down, and adjusting themselves for comfort.</li>
            <li> On the install, I did not get it as tight as I wanted.</li>
            <li> Tried and tried to get seat tight with no luck.</li>
            <li> (You can still attach with that screw, but you may get a little wet)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> How did I ever survive without these little gems?</li>
            <li> These little gizmos stop that from happening.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been thru at least 4 toilet seats in the past 5 yrs with my disabled daughter as she tends to \\&quot;wiggle around\\&quot; while seated.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Likely won&#x27;t work on thin seats or some novelty</li>
            <li> No more safety belts needed.</li>
            <li> No more sliding seats.</li>
            <li> No more sliping and sliding while on the throne.</li>
            <li> No more ruined seats.</li>
            <li> I usually hold the family reunions and we have an assortment of body types using the toilets.</li>
            <li> It will not affect performance, but may make repositioning difficult if I ever need to do that, or remove and re-use it on another toilet seat.  </li>
            <li> Not suitable for plastic seats.</li>
            <li> I popped these suckers on and they aren&#x27;t going anywhere.</li>
            <li> There is no more sliding!</li>
            <li> No more wobbly seats for me!  </li>
            <li> It’s quite annoying to have the toilet seat slip when you sit down.  </li>
            <li> but that stupid seat slid sideways every time I used it because our 200 year old house has slanted floors and nothing is level.</li>
            <li> We attached these to 2 of our toilets and we have had no issues with broken hinges since that time.  </li>
            <li> but it was somewhat frustrating getting them placed correctly.</li>
            <li> I hate that, until now, SAFE-T bumpers does the trick, NO MORE SLIPPING!!!</li>
            <li> I installed these about a week ago after trying something else that failed.  </li>
            <li> I am so looking forward to rec&#x27;g these stabilizers to help with the very irritating problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m probably stupid</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t you hate it when they slide over?</li>
            <li> You will no be disappointed!</li>

            <li> provided a snugger fit for bidet</li>
            <li> What is it about toilet seats, especially those with plastic hinges, which skitter off-center?!  These thingies absolutely solve the problem!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really great!</li>
            <li> The Compac Safe-T-Bumpers were relatively easy to install. The first set took about 10 minutes but once I knew the procedure  the other two sets took about 5 minutes each. They work quite well and I am pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I could not be more pleased with the prompt delivery and the quality of this product.  I could find nothing even close to this product in our local stores.....when I would ask they would say they don&#x27;t have such a product and have never heard of it.  I was so pleased with the one I ordered for my own 2 bathroom&#x27;s that I bought several more for my children&#x27;s home&#x27;s and for a select group of friend&#x27;s.  I would most definetely recommend your product.  Happy in Indiana</li>
            <li> I found these adapters over 10 years ago at a Home Depot in California.  On the east coast now, and no one seems to know about these things.  They are great!  They keep the toilet seat in place.  No shifting and no pinching your thighs or bottom.</li>
            <li> Worked as described. Bought one for each toilet.</li>
            <li> These definitely do the trick on my new but poor-fitting seats.  I bought the new seats because they were one piece (easier to clean) , and had a nice soft-return action- unfortunately they just don&#x27;t fit right!  The bumpers seem a bit bulky, but I guess that&#x27;s what&#x27;s needed to get the job done.  Because you have to screw these into the underside of your seat, I can&#x27;t consider my seats to be one piece any more (thus a little harder to clean), but no more sliding around!  Before this I tried new washers, specialized washers, but only this did the trick.</li>
            <li> We ordered it by mistake. Get no use for it</li>
            <li> This product does what it says. I have been searching for the right thing to stop the toilet seat from slipping. How many times have you sat on the toilet and the seat slips to one side? I hate that, until now, SAFE-T bumpers does the trick, NO MORE SLIPPING!!! I love it and you will too.</li>
            <li> The product makes the toilet safe for those who are handicapped so that the toilet seat does not move when trying to take care of the paper work and sitting and rising the seat does not move causing embalance of the person. Prevents falls as well.</li>
            <li> These are the best things for stopping the slip and slide off the toilet. Keeps the seat secure.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to help keep the toilet seat from slipping around and this works BEAUTIFULLY......I am disabled and really don&#x27;t need the seat moving from side to side.  And now I also don&#x27;t have to worry about my small grand kids pinching tiny fingers when getting on and off.</li>
            <li> Yes those t bumpers did the trick, they are awesome, no more slip and hopefully no more trips to the hardware store to fix the seat bolts...  thank you.</li>
            <li> This is a simple solution to an aggravating problem, a seat that keeps slipping from side to side. These were easy to install. I fixed two seats. It took me about 10 minutes for each seat, not counting getting my tools together to do the job. My wife is pleased about how sturdy the seat now feels, and that&#x27;s what matters most.</li>
            <li> Such a simple idea and yet they really make a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know how it is when you are finishing up the job.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes the seat wants to slide off of the bowl.&lt;br /&gt;Eventually that action breaks the seat hinges.&lt;br /&gt;Now you need a new seat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not with these guys installed.&lt;br /&gt;They seat stays right where it is supposed to be, centered over the bowl rim.&lt;br /&gt;No more broken hinges.</li>
            <li> Very easy to install.  No cons come to mind.  I bought 2 just in case.  These really should come standard with toilets or toilet seats.</li>
            <li> Works as intended.  However, I thought it was to stabilize the from front to back, not side to side.  But, it works to keep the seat in place.</li>
            <li> Amazon was so helpful in helping me find the toilet parts that I needed. They work wonderfully. Thank you amazon.</li>
            <li> This product is very easy to install, and it works very well.  No more slide slipping with the toilet seat.  Just as advertised.</li>
            <li> One of the best ways to stabilize a moving toilet seat. Keeps the seat centered on the bowl all the time.</li>
            <li> These things are ESSENTIAL. No wiggly toilet seat</li>
            <li> These solved a huge problem at my work. We have 3 toilets and they are used ALL the time. They kept getting jiggly and people were complaining. I popped these suckers on and they aren&#x27;t going anywhere. I&#x27;m probably stupid but I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to use the rubber band for the life of me. So I had to move them around a few times until I got it in the right spot.</li>
            <li> This product prevents a toilet from seat sliding from side to side and breaking the plastic hinges.  What can I say other than that it works nicely.</li>
            <li> This product is not &amp;#34;user-friendly&amp;#34; for the mechanically challenged. It would be easier just to buy a new toilet seat, which is exactly what I am going to end up doing.</li>
            <li> Are you tired of loose toilet seats?&lt;br /&gt;These inexpensive and easy to install devices will prevent your toilet seat from sliding sideways ever again and thus no loose seat bolts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially helpful for people with disabilities that need a secure and stable seat.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally discuss bathroom issues, but it is very unnerving to slide sideways while taking care of business. This is a very handy invention for modern society. After going through several toilet seats, and getting tired of slipping and sliding off my perch, I knew that there had to be a better way. Why toilet seat manufacturers do not include seat stabilizers, I will never know; but I am sure that in some unrecognizable way, this invention has saved my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The installation of these Safe-T-Bumpers was a little finicky, however it was not difficult. It is best to start with a clean or new toilet seat, and connect the bumpers to the toilet seat with the included rubber band. Next, set the seat down on the toilet bowl and adjust the bumpers so they sit within the bowl. Finally you can lift the seat, and permanently attach the Safe-T-Bumpers with the included screws, as long as you don&#x27;t drop a screw in the water! (You can still attach with that screw, but you may get a little wet)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product, I have not had to purchase another toilet seat, or tighten the bolts connecting the seat. A recommended purchase for every household.</li>
            <li> These work very well to keep the toilet seat in place even with heavy use and larger people, even when you have to twist on the seat to reach toilet paper.</li>
            <li> My toilet seat wiggles no longer!</li>
            <li> The best structures built always start with a solid foundation.  I recently had to replace the entire hinge assembly on the toilet seat as the shifting of the seat finally broke the hinge.  This invention (Safe-T-Bumpers) added the benefit of immovable strength to the seat.  Not only is this arrangement WAY more comfortable, the hinge assembly is no longer threatened by my weight and shiftiness. I highly recommend this as an inexpensive way to greatly improve your \\&quot;thronal\\&quot; experience..... :)</li>
            <li> Did the job it was purchased for. What else can you say. The gadget was just what was needed to correct the problem.</li>
            <li> Easy to install, inexpensive and it works.  This simple fix for unstable toilet seat should be standard equipment on all toilet seats.</li>
            <li> Now if i&#x27;m sitting on the toilet and i need to reach down and pick up something from the floor or to pet my cat, the toilet seat doesn&#x27;t slide.</li>
            <li> Finally a product that keeps the commode seat secure. Easy to install and takes only a few minutes, I recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> These are the best invention for toilet seat stabilization.  We were using more toilet seats than toilet paper!  We attached these to 2 of our toilets and we have had no issues with broken hinges since that time.  A must have for those who limited mobility once they are sitting down. Easy to install and the price is right!  Don&#x27;t think this can not be the answer.  They are!</li>
            <li> It is very easy (relatively) to attach to the toilet seat and it mostly guarantees that the seat does not slide back and forth.  For the price, a great object.</li>
            <li> Bought 2 packs, 1 of the bumpers was &#x27;softer&#x27; than the other 3. When tightening screw, it dug into the plastic. It will not affect performance, but may make repositioning difficult if I ever need to do that, or remove and re-use it on another toilet seat.  My brother sits sideways on the toilet so he can face the sink and smoke, and now he can do that without the seat cover shifting. Also, I should&#x27;ve bought these when Amazon had these as free-shipping &#x27;add-ons&#x27; because I paid $7.24 each, after shipping charges added, which was more than the cost of the seat they&#x27;re attached to.  I see they are now available for as low as $2.68 + $2 shipping, or $5.02 as an add-on item, a much better price for these.</li>
            <li> Wow! This item is so simple and so easy to install.  It does the job fabulously. You need it? Get it.</li>
            <li> These work great to stabilize a loose toilet seat.  We had to order these after we bought two new commodes and found nothing that would stabilize the seats.</li>
            <li> If you own a toilet seat that slips sideways this is the solution.  They are easy to install, and work perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;If you have people who weigh a lot using the toilet this is essential to keep the seat in place.  It can be used for any toilet seat or shaped toilet bowl.  It is simple, easy to install yourself, and works as it should without disappointing.</li>
            <li> they work great, seat doesn&#x27;t slide</li>
            <li> For elderly and disabled - and children that perform odd gymnastics on a toilet seat… THIS IS A MAGNIFICENT STABILIZER!  No more crushed &#x27;bumpers&#x27;, or wobble.  No pinched fingers or legs.  Stops the wobble, super sturdy.  Simple to secure.  Perfect.  You will no be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Easy to screw in, works great, keeps the potty from breaking or sliding to the side.&lt;br /&gt;A much needed accessory that everyone needs.&lt;br /&gt;Can be used over and over on different seats.</li>
            <li> I am pleased wirh my purchase</li>
            <li> These things do exactly what they are supposed to do - keep the toilet seat from sliding from side to side.  Only one caveat - we have one toilet which has a plastic seat with a concave underside to the seat, and I don&#x27;t think the bumpers can be mounted on it.  I believe the seat underside has to be flat in order to mount these bumpers correctly.</li>
            <li> Even high quality seats become lose sometimes, and I have used these bumpers for years to keep the seat stable and non moving when in ue. Great Purchase with secure comfort..</li>
            <li> they are great for heavy or very young or handicapt. keeps the seat in place</li>
            <li> Great Product, works great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M IN A WHEELCHAIR 24/7 AND KNOWING THE SEAT WILL NOT TWIST, FLEX, AND BREAK THE HINGES IS A GREAT FEELING. How did I ever survive without these little gems? And easy to install? I did it myself! Such great excitement from something so simple and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> When added to the Big John seat, all side-to-side movement is stopped. Installing these does take a bit more work, but using the rubber band alignment idea helps a lot.</li>
            <li> I used these to raise the front of the toilet seat after installing a bidet and they work great, easy to install and adjust</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t stop the room from spinning but It takes the wobble out your wiggle!  Everyone&#x27;s wiggle should have one of these.</li>
            <li> harder to put on than other options that lock in the screws, plus presents one more thing that needs cleaning/disinfecting.</li>
            <li> They should make this a standard feature on all toilet seats.</li>
            <li> Good item, price, and delivery time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for toilet seat stabilizers &amp; no one sells them.  Used a set years ago.  I&#x27;ve been thru at least 4 toilet seats in the past 5 yrs with my disabled daughter as she tends to \\&quot;wiggle around\\&quot; while seated. I am so looking forward to rec&#x27;g these stabilizers to help with the very irritating problem. Thank you!</li>
            <li> These really work!  My toilet seats have not had to be readjusted or tightened since we installed them more than a year ago.</li>
            <li> Finally, no more moving toilet seat.</li>
            <li> As advertised. Havn&#x27;t installed yet.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, solves the sliding seat problem but take your time installing</li>
            <li> This product is amazing for keeping your wooden toilet seat from sliding around. Helps protect hinges from breaking. Easy to install. I have them on three seat in my bathrooms now.</li>
            <li> Lock the seat in position very well.</li>
            <li> Perfect quality, price, speed etal.</li>
            <li> I installed these about a week ago after trying something else that failed.  These seem to be perfect so far.</li>
            <li> If you have ever sat on a toilet seat that moves from side to side it is so aggravating. This is the answer. After installing the safety bumpers their is no side to side movement. No more safety belts needed.</li>
            <li> Great for wheelchair users. I wish I had known about these years ago.</li>
            <li> great product, but you have to be careful not to over tighten because the screw tip can hurt the user thighs</li>
            <li> This is really a necessity for the commode seat, no more wiggling ever.&lt;br /&gt;Great product and great Amazon service, great price.</li>
            <li> These work perfectly well once you figure out how, exactly, to install them. Would have given them 5 stars but it was somewhat frustrating getting them placed correctly. Very good purchase that you will not regret.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t stay on very long.</li>
            <li> OMG, what a difference this product makes! The seat was so mobile I knew it would just break loose.  This product is wonderful. There is no more sliding! There&#x27;s no give at all!</li>
            <li> My toilet seat no longer slip and slide now and it is very safe to use for our family.The instructions are very easy to follow. This is a great product.I would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> For a novice instruction were not as clear as they could be</li>
            <li> Stable is the right word!  We have used this product in 5 homes and recommended them to others.  No longer have to worry about seats slipping and dumping guests.</li>
            <li> This product eliminates the problem of the seat slipping or sliding from one side to another, which is only really a problem if you have an elongated seat.  They were relatively easy to install and the price was right!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is probably the best tool I have.  It keeps the toilet seat from shifting when I transfer my paralyzed body onto the toilet.</li>
            <li> Perfect every tolit should have these. I have not fell off one time sense I installed them. Lol</li>
            <li> I installed these on my toilet seat some months ago and the seat is now stable and steady, even though the integrity of the seat hinges had already failed (likely due to certain of my physical characteristics which won&#x27;t be detailed here). Not only do they work, the installation, while a little more involved than opening a can of beans, was still much easier than I expected. It was not necessary to remove the toilet seat, there is no measuring required, nor do you have to use templates. All you need are the two rubber bands which are included in the kit, along with a drill and screwdriver. I even wrote the company to complement them on the innovative installation method.&lt;br /&gt;PRO:&lt;br /&gt;- They work really well.&lt;br /&gt;- Installation is much simpler than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;CON:&lt;br /&gt;- Your own tools are required: a drill and Phillips screwdriver.&lt;br /&gt;- Likely won&#x27;t work on thin seats or some novelty seats.&lt;br /&gt;TIP:&lt;br /&gt;- Be cautious with the drill so as not to push all the way through the seat.</li>
            <li> These things are great for keeping seat from sliding. Some seats have this problem and then the hinges break, but these keep the seat in place.  Have to be handy with a drill to install, only drawback, but hubby had no problem.  Only for use on wooden seat though, dont think you could drill into plastic.</li>
            <li> This product does what it says.  I read the reviews and decided to order it and just got my husband to install it recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have a water saver toilet with a plastic seat and lid.  My son sits on the lid to put his socks on when he gets dressed after taking his shower and ends up loosening the whole seat from sitting on it.  We’ve had to replace the plastic bolts holding the seat/lid in place once already.  Over time, one bolt broke because of constant slipping (you’d tighten it up and he’d loosen it up again putting his socks on).  It’s quite annoying to have the toilet seat slip when you sit down.  These did the trick and are a hidden gem.  These really would be ideal to install when you have kids, for elderly people for safety, or you have a son that insists on sitting on the lid to put his socks on.  The seat/lid no longer slips and sits in place as it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Installation was easy.  The product does what it says it does and I would definitely recommend it.  You’ll wonder how you lived without it.</li>
            <li> Even the guy that installed them for me was impressed by them.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to purchase this product, and I know there have been others on here that have successfully installed the device on their plastic seat. But the manufacturer specifically states: &amp;#34;Suitable for all wooden toilet seats. Not suitable for plastic seats. Dimensions of each bracket: - Length of side with screw holes: 4.5cm (1.75&amp;#34;); - Height: 3cm (1.25&amp;#34;); - Width: 1.7cm (0.75&amp;#34;)&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may come back and try if I can&#x27;t find any other suitable alternative.</li>
            <li> I really like these -- they should be required on all plastic seats that seem to slide from side to side after a little use.</li>
            <li> did not work out for me</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed. Well worth the money. I liked it so well I ordered others for my children. Easy to install.</li>
            <li> Have these in another bathroom and they work excellent.  We use to have to replace the seats often but not since buying these over a year ago.  We need a new bidet for master bathroom so bought these to have on hand when replacement comes in.  The bidet is so nice that we installed one in our Motor Home.  Not expensive or difficult to install.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tackled putting these on because drilling holes need to be done, will wait to make sure I want to use them..</li>
            <li> This is the best and most amazing thing ever invented. OK, that might be an exaggeration, but I feel very strongly about this. My husband said there was no problem with the upstairs toilet but that stupid seat slid sideways every time I used it because our 200 year old house has slanted floors and nothing is level. I tried the plugs that go inside the screw holes and those did not work. These worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> The solution for creeping toilet seats THAT WORKS. No more sliding seats. It takes a little caution not to drill too deep.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t use them. Didn&#x27;t realize that they sued screws.couldn&#x27;t return them so they will go in the goodwill bag.will be more careful about return policy.</li>
            <li> These were the perfect answer to my moving toilet seat. Can&#x27;t fall off the throne now. Safe for younger and older members to use also.</li>
            <li> I purchased my 3rd set of these now. The first set has kept my wife happy. She doesn&#x27;t like the seat on the toilet to move. My last set was installed on a friends toilet and she loves it also.</li>
            <li> My new toilet seat kept on slipping to one side. No matter how tighten the seat screws were it still slipped. I even bought new seat screws to have it only slip again.  Once I saw these safe-t- bumpers I thought I will try them.. Wish I saw them before. No more sliping and sliding while on the throne.</li>
            <li> This item is totally worth it. Works great for keeping toilet seats in place and not sliding all over the place when you sit down. No more ruined seats. I would recommend it to anyone who has a toilet.</li>
            <li> as a bigger Fella I felt extra protection was in order, and this product gave that protection</li>
            <li> Love it, no more wobble of the toilet seat or being afraid of falling off the toilet seat &amp; hitting the floor.</li>
            <li> These are a little bit touchy to install properly, but once in place, they are very effective. There is no doubt in my mind that when a toilet seat can move from side to side, it will, and over time that movement will loosen the seat&#x27;s connection to the toilet. When it loosens, it will allow more movement, and so on, until finally it is so loose that it&#x27;s unsafe, and you wind up replacing the whole seat. These little bumpers very effectively prevent the seat from sliding from side to side, and thereby prevent undue stress and strain on the connection to the toilet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There could be some better instructions and \\&quot;templates\\&quot; provided to place them properly, but otherwise, they are very good.</li>
            <li> this solved the moving toilet seat ... if you want to stop the slip and slid of your standard toilet seat, this little tab will stop any movement</li>
            <li> If it fits yor toilet seat you are buying a great product specially when overweight people use your toiletes.&lt;br /&gt;No more broken seats.</li>
            <li> Very stable. It makes bidet use easier with no wiggling. Inexpensive and practical indispensable bathroom accessory. Could not do without one.</li>
            <li> I have loved these!  When ever I change toilet seats I transfer these to the new one.  It is nice to sit down and have the toiley seat move!</li>
            <li> Replaced the toilet and no matter how I tightened the bolts the would very quickly loosen and the damned seat would shift.  Was told about these bay Lowes employee (whoever you were- thank you!!!) and found them on Amazon.  Quick &amp; painless to install and haven&#x27;t looked back since.  The seat stays rock solid just like it should.</li>
            <li> Wished more info had been put in the online description.  The elastic is only a temporary hold.  They work, but they aren&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li> came in a timely manner. Work wonderful Should have sold them in stores. I purchased (recently) a toilet set that said the bar on the back would keep the seat from moving around and they lied. This is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Prevents commode seat from side to side wiggle which can break the hinge. IT also prevents the chance of a fall to those who have trouble getting up and down, and adjusting themselves for comfort. Worth the money and lasts for years.</li>
            <li> Yes these little bumpers work great, wish we would have found them 3 toilet seat ago.  Easy to install.  Work great.  They really do stop the rocking of the seat.  What a great invention.</li>
            <li> Great, worked better than I thought they would.</li>
            <li> On the install, I did not get it as tight as I wanted. But it still works. They be very small in size, good and bad in a way. Good, they do not get in the way of any thing. Bad, if you are using something like a Luxe Bidet, it raised the seat up some at the back and there is a fairly large gap. If I had used Compac model, I would have been SOL. I also ordered from Amazon at the same time, &amp;#34;Toilet Seat Stoppers&amp;#34; and work great for my purpose.&lt;br /&gt;I put these on the guest bathroom toilet seat and worked good.</li>
            <li> I have a problem keeping the bolt on one side of the commode seat from stripping. I was having to buy new ones monthly. These bumpers have solved the problem! Gave some to all my family with the same problem.</li>
            <li> Where have these things been all my life!!!  I have had so many toilet seats break at the hinges just from leaning a bit while on the seat.. like to wipe etc...  these things keep the seat from scooching side to side and damaging the hinges.  I&#x27;ll never be without these again.  sometimes the small things resolve the most aggravating problems. what an easy fix.</li>
            <li> great product - works great</li>
            <li> These are so great for stabilizing the toilet seat. Don&#x27;t you hate it when they slide over? These little gizmos stop that from happening. Easy to put on, too.</li>
            <li> Does what they&#x27;re  supposed to do. Keeps the toilet seat from sliding from side to side. Easy to install, just need a drill and a screwdriver.</li>
            <li> Tried and tried to get seat tight with no luck. I happened upon these while researching on the net&lt;br /&gt;and figured for the price they were worth a try. They installed quickly and easily and solved the&lt;br /&gt;problem of the shifting seat right away. Simple but effective.</li>
            <li> the screws came all the way through the toilet seat.  don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> I bought it with the Toilet Tool as I was determined to stop the slippage of my toilet seats at any cost!  But the toilet tool worked so well I didn&#x27;t have to use this.</li>
            <li> I usually hold the family reunions and we have an assortment of body types using the toilets. I put these on before my last reunion and it withstood the largest of them. The seats stay in place. They are easy to install and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> No more wobbly seats for me!  These things work.  This is the fourth or fifth set we&#x27;ve gotten as we add them to additional toilets.</li>
            <li> It really works, stops the seat from sliding around,</li>
            <li> The seat my builders installed does not have a very secure mounting and would work itself loose over time.  The bumpers solved my problem.  They were easy to install.</li>
            <li> These little gadgets work great and solved one of my biggest pet peeves. So easy to install- I put them on two toilet seats in less than15 min.</li>
            <li> Have a sliding toilet seat?  This is the best thing since sliced bread</li>
            <li> It held the seat in place. It stopped the seat from sliding and wobbling when I sit on the seat.</li>
            <li> arrived quickly and are very good quality</li>
