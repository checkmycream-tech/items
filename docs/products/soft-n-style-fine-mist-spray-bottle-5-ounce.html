            <li>I love these!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great spray bottle for that, since it sprays a light mist so I can avoid overwatering my plant.</li>
            <li>Considering this was $2, this is quite nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the kind that breaks apart when peeled.</li>
            <li>In the photo it looks kind of milky</li>

            <li>These are nice and sturdy--</li>
            <li>These are really nice, they&#x27;re thicker than I thought , nice for spritzing oil  on body ,or for  some hair products if not to thick..good deal..</li>
            <li>Makes a nice mist.</li>
            <li>Good fine spray that comes out.</li>
            <li>This was the best by far.</li>
            <li>But this works great and does exactly what I need it to do.</li>
            <li>This spray bottle has no hard-to-manage trigger so it is very comfortable to use in any position.</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made product.</li>
            <li>, I noticed a lot of reviewers saying beware, this is a very light spray...</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made, I wouldn&#x27;t buy again or recommend them.</li>
            <li>It sprays a nice, fine mist.</li>
            <li>Otherwise provides a nice, fine mist.</li>
            <li>Barring that, if all you&#x27;re looking for is a light spray bottle then this is the one!</li>
            <li>Love this bottle just wish the cap would work</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d pay a couple cents more to support them using a quality UPC sticker or just plastering that on the bag instead of the bottle itself.</li>
            <li>nothing special..saw better at the dollar store.</li>
            <li>I wanted this bottle to be more of a spray</li>
            <li>Enjoy it!</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This spray bottle works good with water, but will not work with oil, I was trying to come up with a fine mist sprayer for oil, but this ones does not work for that, but less dense liquids work perfect with this.</li>
            <li>Works fine, nice fine mist.</li>
            <li>This sprayer does not provide a fine mist -- it is more of a squirt.  </li>
            <li>Cheap but OK.</li>
            <li>It puts out the perfect mist and DOES NOT LEAK like so many other spray bottles!  </li>
            <li>They made this one RIGHT!!  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and fill.  </li>
            <li>Great for taking along some of your favorite perfume in a smaller, easier to deal with container.  </li>
            <li>you can easily see what is inside.</li>
            <li>No leaks, no fuss, and fits easily in my diaper bag.</li>
            <li>But still going strong</li>
            <li>It is easy to handle, easy to store and sprays a fine mist on my hair and not a stream that leaves marks.  </li>
            <li>Super fine mist, holds up well!</li>
            <li>The bottle looks sturdy and well made and it sprays a fine mist.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It produces a fine mist.  </li>
            <li>It works fine, but you can&#x27;t take it on an airplane.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had any issues, sprays a fine mist.</li>
            <li>People that are reporting mist that isn&#x27;t &#x27;fine&#x27; perhaps are using a liquid that is too viscous.</li>
            <li>This worked just fine.</li>
            <li>The spray functioned just fine</li>
            <li>Really fine mist and quality product.</li>
            <li>This product worked fine for a couple weeks.  </li>
            <li>simple product but worked great.</li>
            <li>The bottle is nice looking, but turned out not to be very durable.</li>
            <li>This spray bottle is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I put these in our office restrooms filled with bathroom spray.  </li>
            <li>This is a great bottle and I will use it from here on out to pour my hairspray into since my store bought bottle seems to squirt out in big streaks.  </li>
            <li>The cap stays secure.</li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>This is a great little bottle and arrived all safe and sound.</li>
            <li>It worked better when I first used it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it to spray distilled vinegar to clean and to spray water to alleviate bed-hair when I don&#x27;t have time to shower in the morning.</li>
            <li>I am using the bottle to hold disinfectant that is being used to clean CPR manikins after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>very clear appearance to the bottle looks nice.</li>
            <li>I use this mister to  spray acrylic paint palette and paper to keep paint moist, or to create special effects.  </li>
            <li>it makes it so much easier to moisturize my hair in braids, and to make sure i am evenly coating all of my hair.</li>
            <li>Cheap but worth the price.</li>
            <li>This is surprisingly sturdy feeling for the price, and it even has a cute little cap.</li>
            <li>Once I cut them down to the correct length they worked great.</li>
            <li>It is very tiny but good for a purse if totally empty with no water in it because top falls off easily</li>
            <li>Great little spray bottle.</li>
            <li>I filled it with the liquid and used a permanent marker to write directly on the bottle, which took the ink just fine - no need to use a label/tape on it.</li>
            <li>This bottle does what it says, sprays a fine mist, which is nice and not too wet.</li>
            <li>This is a great spray bottle for anything really, it&#x27;s not cheaply made either.</li>
            <li>I can also see this spray bottle being useful for hair care and cooking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it with water and essential oils to make my own &#x27;Poo-Pourri&#x27;.</li>
            <li>For the price and delivery time, I don&#x27;t think it was worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth the cost and the wait.</li>
            <li>This is just the right size for spraying my hair with water before putting on curlers.</li>
            <li>This was the right product at the price we wanted.</li>
            <li>Great small spray bottle that I use to mist my orchids</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a sprayer with a very fine mist, then do not buy this one, as its mist is standard.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Soft N Style Fine Mist 5 ounce Spray Bottle.  </li>
            <li>I needed something to spray my orchid (Phalaenopsis) and this [[ASIN:B001CYC4I4 Soft &#x27;n Style Fine Mist Spray Bottle / 5 oz.</li>
            <li>Good quality but a little overpriced.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>Broke after first use.....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely buy more of these.</li>
            <li>I placed some water in the bottle just to test it out first.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is made of a harder plastic which is nice.  </li>
            <li>I bought this bottle to use for hair styling products, and the bottle itself holds a few ounces and is a good size for a travel accessory bag.</li>
            <li>This bottle has a very fine mist and has sprayed with no trouble so far.</li>
            <li>I found it to be much more powerful than I expected.</li>
            <li>The tube that connects to the stray top and into the bottle was way too long and needed to be cut for the bottle to work.</li>
            <li>I bought three different spray bottles, trying to find one that would be easy to use.</li>
            <li>I bought this a couple of months ago and the top of the spray was loose and I just tried using it and noticed that it doesn&#x27;t work because of the loose top</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a smooth spray and will probably last forever.</li>
            <li>When I bought it, the price was quite reasonable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a lot of bottle over the years that the pump doesn&#x27;t work very well or at all on.</li>
            <li>It holds about a cup of water, so it doesn&#x27;t have to be refilled very often.</li>
            <li>Very fine,even mist.</li>
            <li>I mean, I think that is a good thing, because I can saturate my hair with it, but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small enough to be unobtrusive, yet feels good in the hand and sprays the perfect mist for a smallish cutting board.  </li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and go to ANY home, grocery, dollar store and buy something better for less money.</li>
            <li>It holds a decent amount of liquid too, so it doesn&#x27;t run out too</li>
            <li>I saw similar bottles, but better quality, I assume, at Target for a dollar, in the mixed item bins as you walk in the door.</li>
            <li>spray is really a decent mist (not an ungainly stream) and the spring mechanism works</li>
            <li>I love this little bottle.  </li>
            <li>Of course sending it back would cost me another $3 and isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>Further, it is very cheaply made, and the stem is far too long for the bottle.</li>
            <li>I filled this bottle with automotive detailing liquid to use on our cars when they get a bird dropping or other stain on the paint.</li>
            <li>I needed a new bottle for my hairspray.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is very clear.  </li>
            <li>small enough to store easily but holds just the right amount.</li>
            <li>I noted that someone say the spray is not fine enough, but the two I have a very fine mist.</li>
            <li>I like that it is clear too, so</li>
            <li>The material is transparent and clear unlike in the picture -</li>
            <li>We fill it with a natural bathroom spray rather than using the overlarge 22 oz bottle.</li>
            <li>No issues with it so far.</li>
            <li>I have been using this frequently for over a month and the pump is leaking.</li>
            <li>when you press down on the pump, solution will dribble out regardless of how full you fill the bottle.</li>
            <li>I was able to &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; the large dent out, but these are thicker plastic that the norm, and the bottle was left with only small dent.</li>
            <li>This is so much more convenient to use for those small touch ups in lieu of getting out the big 32 ounce spay bottle.</li>
            <li>only thing to keep in mind is that this spray bottle only sprays a light mist -- there are no settings to change the amount of mist like some of the other spray bottles you may see on the market.</li>
            <li>Other than that, all I can say is that it is exactly what it says it is, and functions as spray bottle should.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used this to put various substances in my hair, and the spray is so wide and strong that my shirt/skin is wet when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s actually crystal clear,</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t produce a mist, and barely gets any liquid out of the bottle anymore.</li>
            <li>The nozzle provides a very fine mist, and the tube goes firmly to the bottom so that not a drop is wasted.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice until it was full of water sitting on my counter next to my electronics - which were then sitting in a pool of water a few hours later.</li>
            <li>Long delivery time, product shipped in soft sided envelope and arrived dented.</li>
            <li>It sprays a single straight line of fluid with zero spread and certainly no misting.</li>

            <li> They made this one RIGHT!!  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and fill.  </li>
            <li> Great for taking along some of your favorite perfume in a smaller, easier to deal with container.  </li>
            <li> you can easily see what is inside.</li>
            <li> No leaks, no fuss, and fits easily in my diaper bag.</li>
            <li> But still going strong</li>
            <li> It is easy to handle, easy to store and sprays a fine mist on my hair and not a stream that leaves marks.  </li>
            <li> Super fine mist, holds up well!</li>
            <li> The bottle looks sturdy and well made and it sprays a fine mist.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It produces a fine mist.  </li>
            <li> It works fine, but you can&#x27;t take it on an airplane.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had any issues, sprays a fine mist.</li>
            <li> People that are reporting mist that isn&#x27;t &#x27;fine&#x27; perhaps are using a liquid that is too viscous.</li>
            <li> This worked just fine.</li>
            <li> The spray functioned just fine</li>
            <li> Really fine mist and quality product.</li>
            <li> This product worked fine for a couple weeks.  </li>
            <li> simple product but worked great.</li>
            <li> The bottle is nice looking, but turned out not to be very durable.</li>
            <li> This spray bottle is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I put these in our office restrooms filled with bathroom spray.  </li>
            <li> This is a great bottle and I will use it from here on out to pour my hairspray into since my store bought bottle seems to squirt out in big streaks.  </li>
            <li> The cap stays secure.</li>
            <li> but so far so good.</li>
            <li> This is a great little bottle and arrived all safe and sound.</li>
            <li> It worked better when I first used it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it to spray distilled vinegar to clean and to spray water to alleviate bed-hair when I don&#x27;t have time to shower in the morning.</li>
            <li> I am using the bottle to hold disinfectant that is being used to clean CPR manikins after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> very clear appearance to the bottle looks nice.</li>
            <li> I use this mister to  spray acrylic paint palette and paper to keep paint moist, or to create special effects.  </li>
            <li> it makes it so much easier to moisturize my hair in braids, and to make sure i am evenly coating all of my hair.</li>
            <li> Cheap but worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is surprisingly sturdy feeling for the price, and it even has a cute little cap.</li>
            <li> Once I cut them down to the correct length they worked great.</li>
            <li> It is very tiny but good for a purse if totally empty with no water in it because top falls off easily</li>
            <li> Great little spray bottle.</li>
            <li> I filled it with the liquid and used a permanent marker to write directly on the bottle, which took the ink just fine - no need to use a label/tape on it.</li>
            <li> This bottle does what it says, sprays a fine mist, which is nice and not too wet.</li>
            <li> This is a great spray bottle for anything really, it&#x27;s not cheaply made either.</li>
            <li> I can also see this spray bottle being useful for hair care and cooking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it with water and essential oils to make my own &#x27;Poo-Pourri&#x27;.</li>
            <li> For the price and delivery time, I don&#x27;t think it was worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth the cost and the wait.</li>
            <li> This is just the right size for spraying my hair with water before putting on curlers.</li>
            <li> This was the right product at the price we wanted.</li>
            <li> Great small spray bottle that I use to mist my orchids</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a sprayer with a very fine mist, then do not buy this one, as its mist is standard.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Soft N Style Fine Mist 5 ounce Spray Bottle.  </li>
            <li> I needed something to spray my orchid (Phalaenopsis) and this [[ASIN:B001CYC4I4 Soft &#x27;n Style Fine Mist Spray Bottle / 5 oz.</li>
            <li> Good quality but a little overpriced.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Broke after first use.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely buy more of these.</li>
            <li> I placed some water in the bottle just to test it out first.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is made of a harder plastic which is nice.  </li>
            <li> I bought this bottle to use for hair styling products, and the bottle itself holds a few ounces and is a good size for a travel accessory bag.</li>
            <li> This bottle has a very fine mist and has sprayed with no trouble so far.</li>
            <li> I found it to be much more powerful than I expected.</li>
            <li> The tube that connects to the stray top and into the bottle was way too long and needed to be cut for the bottle to work.</li>
            <li> I bought three different spray bottles, trying to find one that would be easy to use.</li>
            <li> I bought this a couple of months ago and the top of the spray was loose and I just tried using it and noticed that it doesn&#x27;t work because of the loose top</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a smooth spray and will probably last forever.</li>
            <li> When I bought it, the price was quite reasonable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of bottle over the years that the pump doesn&#x27;t work very well or at all on.</li>
            <li> It holds about a cup of water, so it doesn&#x27;t have to be refilled very often.</li>
            <li> Very fine,even mist.</li>
            <li> I mean, I think that is a good thing, because I can saturate my hair with it, but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough to be unobtrusive, yet feels good in the hand and sprays the perfect mist for a smallish cutting board.  </li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and go to ANY home, grocery, dollar store and buy something better for less money.</li>
            <li> It holds a decent amount of liquid too, so it doesn&#x27;t run out too</li>
            <li> I saw similar bottles, but better quality, I assume, at Target for a dollar, in the mixed item bins as you walk in the door.</li>
            <li> spray is really a decent mist (not an ungainly stream) and the spring mechanism works</li>
            <li> I love this little bottle.  </li>
            <li> Of course sending it back would cost me another $3 and isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> Further, it is very cheaply made, and the stem is far too long for the bottle.</li>
            <li> I filled this bottle with automotive detailing liquid to use on our cars when they get a bird dropping or other stain on the paint.</li>
            <li> I needed a new bottle for my hairspray.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is very clear.  </li>
            <li> small enough to store easily but holds just the right amount.</li>
            <li> I noted that someone say the spray is not fine enough, but the two I have a very fine mist.</li>
            <li> I like that it is clear too, so</li>
            <li> The material is transparent and clear unlike in the picture -</li>
            <li> We fill it with a natural bathroom spray rather than using the overlarge 22 oz bottle.</li>
            <li> No issues with it so far.</li>
            <li> I have been using this frequently for over a month and the pump is leaking.</li>
            <li> when you press down on the pump, solution will dribble out regardless of how full you fill the bottle.</li>
            <li> I was able to &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; the large dent out, but these are thicker plastic that the norm, and the bottle was left with only small dent.</li>
            <li> This is so much more convenient to use for those small touch ups in lieu of getting out the big 32 ounce spay bottle.</li>
            <li> only thing to keep in mind is that this spray bottle only sprays a light mist -- there are no settings to change the amount of mist like some of the other spray bottles you may see on the market.</li>
            <li> Other than that, all I can say is that it is exactly what it says it is, and functions as spray bottle should.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used this to put various substances in my hair, and the spray is so wide and strong that my shirt/skin is wet when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s actually crystal clear,</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t produce a mist, and barely gets any liquid out of the bottle anymore.</li>
            <li> The nozzle provides a very fine mist, and the tube goes firmly to the bottom so that not a drop is wasted.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice until it was full of water sitting on my counter next to my electronics - which were then sitting in a pool of water a few hours later.</li>
            <li> Long delivery time, product shipped in soft sided envelope and arrived dented.</li>
            <li> It sprays a single straight line of fluid with zero spread and certainly no misting.</li>
            <li> This is just a cheap, small, plastic spray bottle that can be purchased at any dollar store for less, and without the wait.</li>
            <li> This is pretty much a standard spray bottle, though one thing is that the tube that sucks the liquid up is very long, like longer than the bottle is tall by several inches, so you don&#x27;t have the short little tube where you have to refill it when there is still liquid on the bottom.</li>
            <li> but the bottles that I got have a draw straw that is way too long.</li>
            <li> The spray does not work unless you shorten the valve (cut it), because it&#x27;s way too long, and even then, only works if you unscrew the lid for some sort of pressurization purposes unknown to me.</li>
            <li> This bottle came a little bigger then exppected.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quicker than expected considering where it&#x27;s from.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this over the last few months in the kitchen to spray vinegar on our butcher block for cleaning purposes.  </li>
            <li> It got crushed in on the bottom of one side while in my backpack.</li>
            <li> Therefore, it was not really what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Not much to say.</li>
            <li> The mist comes out wide and even.  </li>
            <li> Product came as expected and I have not had any problems with it whatsoever.</li>
            <li> not too small yet not too big.</li>
            <li> If you are in the market for a spray bottle this is the one, money well spent!</li>
            <li> I would give them 5 stars for the cost, however one of them does not work as well as the other two.</li>
            <li> The tiny mist spray bottle seemed overpriced for how small it was..</li>
            <li> Occasionally it would jam and you&#x27;d have to hit the trigger really hard to make anything come out.  </li>
            <li> Probably not worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really mess that up.</li>
            <li> I give friends little spray bottles of Magnesium Oil to help with their aging problems.</li>
            <li> I paid a little over $3.00 for this product and another $3 for shipping.</li>
            <li> It is a sturdy little bottle.</li>
            <li> This one has not let me down!</li>
            <li> The nozzles on all of them either didn&#x27;t work to begin with or stopped working after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> The spraying mechanism broke within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have a few liquid things I can put in it</li>
            <li> They are inexpensive but don&#x27;tr waste your time.</li>
            <li> I have small hands</li>
            <li> I needed a small squirt bottle.</li>
            <li> I was too lazy to go to target and purchase one.</li>
            <li> hard on the thumb/finger though if u need to spray alot.</li>
            <li> and now I can&#x27;t return it because it&#x27;s too late.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this bottle had an unseen pinhole in the center of the bottom of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Loses a star for the UPC sticker.</li>
            <li> I wrap my hair every night and i apply a very small amount of olive in my hands a run it through the tips of my hair to keep it moisturized.</li>
            <li> This is a ridiculous purchase to make here.</li>
            <li> The others all had a trigger mechanism which was very hard to use.</li>
            <li> Poor quality it seems.</li>
            <li> Used this for a bulk thing of leave in conditioner I bought (it&#x27;s thin).</li>
            <li> This was frustrating but workable, until at around 1 month the nozzle started flying out when I would try to un-jam it.  </li>
            <li> Nothing visually or physically wrong with it that I can SEE, but it doesn&#x27;t work anymore.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this was just past the 30 day mark for me, so it was not eligible for replacement :(</li>
            <li> Too bad I already lost it.  </li>
            <li> Ordered December 10th and received them January 6th and since than all the Spray Pumps went bad.</li>
            <li> It is absolutely worthless.</li>
            <li> Scraping it off leaves the nasty adhesive residue.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Easy to use and fill.  Pump worked great.  simple product but worked great. Had no problems with this at all.</li>
            <li> Works great for spritzing my Trombone, (one for my practice room so I don&#x27;t misplace the one for gigs).  Shipping was quicker than expected considering where it&#x27;s from.</li>
            <li> Super fine mist, holds up well!</li>
            <li> The bottle looks sturdy and well made and it sprays a fine mist.&lt;br /&gt;I bought two and wish I had gotten more!</li>
            <li> I bought three different spray bottles, trying to find one that would be easy to use. This was the best by far. The others all had a trigger mechanism which was very hard to use. I have small hands so I had to use both hands to spray. This spray bottle has no hard-to-manage trigger so it is very comfortable to use in any position. If you use a spray bottle for your hair, this one&#x27;s a winner!</li>
            <li> I bought this bottle to use for hair styling products, and the bottle itself holds a few ounces and is a good size for a travel accessory bag. However, the pump broke within a couple of weeks. The spritzer portion stopped moving back up after you press it. The bottle is nice looking, but turned out not to be very durable.</li>
            <li> Considering this was $2, this is quite nice. It sprays a nice, fine mist. I&#x27;ve used it to spray distilled vinegar to clean and to spray water to alleviate bed-hair when I don&#x27;t have time to shower in the morning.</li>
            <li> The sprayer stopped working after a while.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect spray bottle for my use!  It puts out the perfect mist and DOES NOT LEAK like so many other spray bottles!  They made this one RIGHT!!  I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> This bottle does what it says, sprays a fine mist, which is nice and not too wet. It holds a decent amount of liquid too, so it doesn&#x27;t run out too soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a tip: put a half-teaspoon of baking soda in it, then fill with water. Now spray that on your underarms, feet, shoes, whatever you want deodorized.</li>
            <li> I need something to mist my plants with, and this turned out to be the perfect bottle for that. Very happy</li>
            <li> After about a week of use it stopped spraying. I have tried washing out the sprayer and everything. Nothing works! Very cheaply made product.</li>
            <li> Definitely not a &amp;#34;fine mist&amp;#34;. It sprays a single straight line of fluid with zero spread and certainly no misting.</li>
            <li> Like to keep a spray bottle with glass cleaner in each vehicle for cleaning inside of windshield, eye glasses, etc.&lt;br /&gt;These worked perfectly!!</li>
            <li> This is a great spray bottle.  It&#x27;s the perfect size for traveling.  Great for taking along some of your favorite perfume in a smaller, easier to deal with container.  The nozzle doesn&#x27;t get clogged either.</li>
            <li> Great...just as advertized</li>
            <li> This product works as it should.  I am recently switching to glass bottles to reduce chemical leaching, but all in all this product does what it says.</li>
            <li> I give friends little spray bottles of Magnesium Oil to help with their aging problems. These squirt bottles are perfect for that.</li>
            <li> I got this spray bottle to water my plant, which only needed a couple sprays of water once a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great spray bottle for that, since it sprays a light mist so I can avoid overwatering my plant. I can also see this spray bottle being useful for hair care and cooking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing to keep in mind is that this spray bottle only sprays a light mist -- there are no settings to change the amount of mist like some of the other spray bottles you may see on the market. Barring that, if all you&#x27;re looking for is a light spray bottle then this is the one!</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought it was but it works well. I use it to water my plants every day but you could find it at the store for cheaper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this over the last few months in the kitchen to spray vinegar on our butcher block for cleaning purposes.  It works well.  It&#x27;s small enough to be unobtrusive, yet feels good in the hand and sprays the perfect mist for a smallish cutting board.  Anything bigger than 15-20&amp;#34; and you might want to get a bigger version.</li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to do.  I&#x27;ve only had it about a month but so far so good.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a sprayer with a very fine mist, then do not buy this one, as its mist is standard. Additional details can be found in my comparison review between this and the very superior [[ASIN:B007T79U5I Ultra Mist Water Bottle]] at that product&#x27;s customer review page.</li>
            <li> I bought this a couple of months ago and the top of the spray was loose and I just tried using it and noticed that it doesn&#x27;t work because of the loose top and now I can&#x27;t return it because it&#x27;s too late.  DON&#x27;T BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK!!</li>
            <li> Perfect size and quality for me. I buy my hairspray buy the liter, so I often need extra spray bottles. These are very nice quality, they also come with a plastic cover over the spray nozzle. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this bottle had an unseen pinhole in the center of the bottom of the bottle. I didn&#x27;t notice until it was full of water sitting on my counter next to my electronics - which were then sitting in a pool of water a few hours later. Poor quality it seems.</li>
            <li> This is just a cheap, small, plastic spray bottle that can be purchased at any dollar store for less, and without the wait. The spray does not work unless you shorten the valve (cut it), because it&#x27;s way too long, and even then, only works if you unscrew the lid for some sort of pressurization purposes unknown to me. The bottle collapsed on all sides after three sprays, that&#x27;s how thin and cheap the plastic is. This is a ridiculous purchase to make here. Do yourself a favor and go to ANY home, grocery, dollar store and buy something better for less money. I saw similar bottles, but better quality, I assume, at Target for a dollar, in the mixed item bins as you walk in the door.</li>
            <li> This is surprisingly sturdy feeling for the price, and it even has a cute little cap. This is pretty much a standard spray bottle, though one thing is that the tube that sucks the liquid up is very long, like longer than the bottle is tall by several inches, so you don&#x27;t have the short little tube where you have to refill it when there is still liquid on the bottom. Other than that, all I can say is that it is exactly what it says it is, and functions as spray bottle should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, one thing, I noticed a lot of reviewers saying beware, this is a very light spray... I found it to be much more powerful than I expected. I used this to put various substances in my hair, and the spray is so wide and strong that my shirt/skin is wet when I&#x27;m done. I mean, I think that is a good thing, because I can saturate my hair with it, but just so you know.</li>
            <li> I use cloth diapers and cloth wipes and needed a spray bottle for when I&#x27;m on the go for the &amp;#34;dirty diapers&amp;#34;. This spray bottle is fantastic. The size is perfect. not too small yet not too big. Its very easy to press and the mist is great. Whether you use it for cloth wipes or anything else its awesome :)</li>
            <li> Love this bottle just wish the cap would work so I could take it with me on the go</li>
            <li> Loses a star for the UPC sticker. It&#x27;s the kind that breaks apart when peeled. Scraping it off leaves the nasty adhesive residue. I&#x27;d pay a couple cents more to support them using a quality UPC sticker or just plastering that on the bag instead of the bottle itself.</li>
            <li> Sprayer broke after a day.</li>
            <li> This bottle has a very fine mist and has sprayed with no trouble so far. I like that it is clear too, so you can easily see what is inside.</li>
            <li> I filled this bottle with automotive detailing liquid to use on our cars when they get a bird dropping or other stain on the paint. This is so much more convenient to use for those small touch ups in lieu of getting out the big 32 ounce spay bottle.</li>
            <li> I purchased this spray bottle to hold my postpardum bottom spray and now use it to hold a wipes solution for baby when we are on the go. No leaks, no fuss, and fits easily in my diaper bag.</li>
            <li> I put these in our office restrooms filled with bathroom spray.  The nozzles on all of them either didn&#x27;t work to begin with or stopped working after a few uses.  Very cheaply made, I wouldn&#x27;t buy again or recommend them.</li>
            <li> Broke after first use..... Very cheap! Squirtier stopped working and it was dropped on the floor and blusted and now leaks.</li>
            <li> I paid a little over $3.00 for this product and another $3 for shipping. I just tried using it, and the atomizer part doesn&#x27;t work. It is absolutely worthless. Of course sending it back would cost me another $3 and isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> I needed a small squirt bottle. This is the perfect size and it does not drip like some bottles do.</li>
            <li> This is a great spray bottle for anything really, it&#x27;s not cheaply made either. In the photo it looks kind of milky but it&#x27;s actually crystal clear, I&#x27;d definitely buy more of these.</li>
            <li> been using this for a month or so now, and the cap comes off now&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pain to use at the moment</li>
            <li> The bottle doesn&#x27;t spray or even squirt... when you press down on the pump, solution will dribble out regardless of how full you fill the bottle. Further, it is very cheaply made, and the stem is far too long for the bottle.</li>
            <li> The spraying mechanism broke within a few weeks. It doesn&#x27;t produce a mist, and barely gets any liquid out of the bottle anymore. Nothing visually or physically wrong with it that I can SEE, but it doesn&#x27;t work anymore.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Soft N Style Fine Mist 5 ounce Spray Bottle.  I placed some water in the bottle just to test it out first.  It is the perfect product for what I needed.  Thank you</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to like? It does a nice job spraying. No leaks.</li>
            <li> If you are in the market for a spray bottle this is the one, money well spent!</li>
            <li> This is compact.  The bottle is very clear.  It produces a fine mist.  We fill it with a natural bathroom spray rather than using the overlarge 22 oz bottle.</li>
            <li> I would give them 5 stars for the cost, however one of them does not work as well as the other two.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive spray bottle that... sprays well.</li>
            <li> This spray bottle works good with water, but will not work with oil, I was trying to come up with a fine mist sprayer for oil, but this ones does not work for that, but less dense liquids work perfect with this.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the bottle - it gives a fine mist spray as indicated and the build quality is good. The material is transparent and clear unlike in the picture - which is what I prefer. I am using the bottle to hold disinfectant that is being used to clean CPR manikins after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the product.</li>
            <li> The title says this bottle is 2.6 oz. But what&#x27;s listed in the product description and what you get is a 5 oz bottle. It works fine, but you can&#x27;t take it on an airplane.</li>
            <li> Used this for a bulk thing of leave in conditioner I bought (it&#x27;s thin). Haven&#x27;t had any issues, sprays a fine mist.</li>
            <li> I needed a new bottle for my hairspray.  I love this little bottle.  It is easy to handle, easy to store and sprays a fine mist on my hair and not a stream that leaves marks.  This is a great bottle and I will use it from here on out to pour my hairspray into since my store bought bottle seems to squirt out in big streaks.  This is a great little bottle and arrived all safe and sound.</li>
            <li> The tiny mist spray bottle seemed overpriced for how small it was..nothing special..saw better at the dollar store. It is very tiny but good for a purse if totally empty with no water in it because top falls off easily</li>
            <li> Works great in my golf bag to assist with cleaning my clubs; combined with a frogger brush.</li>
            <li> Worked for what I needed. However, it is not as durable as I needed it to be. It got crushed in on the bottom of one side while in my backpack. The good news is that it still functions but it will not stand vertically.</li>
            <li> Works fine, nice fine mist. I use it with water and essential oils to make my own &#x27;Poo-Pourri&#x27;. People that are reporting mist that isn&#x27;t &#x27;fine&#x27; perhaps are using a liquid that is too viscous.</li>
            <li> I needed something to spray my orchid (Phalaenopsis) and this [[ASIN:B001CYC4I4 Soft &#x27;n Style Fine Mist Spray Bottle / 5 oz. (B44)]] does the job perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;The spray is really a decent mist (not an ungainly stream) and the spring mechanism works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> I bought this bottle as a replacement bottle for some hair product of mine. It does exactly what I need it to do and sprays a perfect mist. The cap stays secure. No issues with it so far.</li>
            <li> I purchased this so I could take a travel-size bottle of &amp;#34;wrinkle-release&amp;#34; with me when I travel by air. This worked just fine. I filled it with the liquid and used a permanent marker to write directly on the bottle, which took the ink just fine - no need to use a label/tape on it. The spray functioned just fine and I didn&#x27;t have to carry a big bottle unneccessarily.</li>
            <li> there is not muc to say about this. It works fine… its a spray bottle</li>
            <li> Does exactly what a small spray bottle should. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> This sprayer does not provide a fine mist -- it is more of a squirt.  Therefore, it was not really what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!!  Too bad I already lost it.  Just ordered me another one.  This is the perfect mist that I was looking for.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this it was to fill with olive oil. I wrap my hair every night and i apply a very small amount of olive in my hands a run it through the tips of my hair to keep it moisturized. I wanted this bottle to be more of a spray but it isn&#x27;t. When i use it it&#x27;s a concentrated stream not a &amp;#34;spritz&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Although the offer was in two boxes, it came as promised.</li>
            <li> I use this for an aromatherapy spray. It is a sturdy little bottle. It didn&#x27;t come with a cap but I had one from a (different brand) bottle that stopped working. It&#x27;s a smooth spray and will probably last forever.</li>
            <li> The atomizer is really good and the bottle doesn&#x27;t fell cheep either but the bottles that I got have a draw straw that is way too long. Once I cut them down to the correct length they worked great.</li>
            <li> Great small spray bottle that I use to mist my orchids but it will function with everything from h2o to perfume, to bug spray.  I noted that someone say the spray is not fine enough, but the two I have a very fine mist.</li>
            <li> I use these bottle to hold scent killer spray that I can pack into the stand with me to respray myself once I get situated.</li>
            <li> Good quality but a little overpriced.  The bottle is made of a harder plastic which is nice.  Good fine spray that comes out.</li>
            <li> These are nice and sturdy-- i store homemade and storebought mixtures in these bottles for my hair and skin-- it makes it so much easier to moisturize my hair in braids, and to make sure i am evenly coating all of my hair.</li>
            <li> Great little spray bottle. Really fine mist and quality product. Do a great job. My bet is You will like these.</li>
            <li> This is just what I needed and it works great. I have a few liquid things I can put in it and it does the job!</li>
            <li> Not much to say. Item is as described. When I bought it, the price was quite reasonable. The quality seems good for the price.</li>
            <li> Ordered December 10th and received them January 6th and since than all the Spray Pumps went bad. They are inexpensive but don&#x27;tr waste your time. JUNK</li>
            <li> Long delivery time, product shipped in soft sided envelope and arrived dented. I was able to &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; the large dent out, but these are thicker plastic that the norm, and the bottle was left with only small dent. The tube that connects to the stray top and into the bottle was way too long and needed to be cut for the bottle to work. For the price and delivery time, I don&#x27;t think it was worth the purchase. Life and learn.</li>
            <li> Cheap but OK. You get what you pay for.. . . .  . . . . asdfg asdfg asdfg asfg</li>
            <li> Cheap but worth the price.</li>
            <li> Great product I suppose-- I was too lazy to go to target and purchase one. Took weeks to arrive though. Probably not worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really mess that up. But this works great and does exactly what I need it to do. Enjoy it!</li>
            <li> This bottle came a little bigger then exppected. Love it, good mist, everything is good about it. So if you want a mist bottle I recommend  this one</li>
            <li> This product worked fine for a couple weeks.  Occasionally it would jam and you&#x27;d have to hit the trigger really hard to make anything come out.  This was frustrating but workable, until at around 1 month the nozzle started flying out when I would try to un-jam it.  Unfortunately, this was just past the 30 day mark for me, so it was not eligible for replacement :(</li>
            <li> It worked better when I first used it. But still going strong</li>
            <li> This broke literally the second time I went to use it. I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love these! They are a great size, and work great.</li>
            <li> These are really nice, they&#x27;re thicker than I thought , nice for spritzing oil  on body ,or for  some hair products if not to thick..good deal..~!~</li>
            <li> This bottle works wonderfully. I&#x27;ve had a lot of bottle over the years that the pump doesn&#x27;t work very well or at all on. This one has not let me down!</li>
            <li> This is just the right size for spraying my hair with water before putting on curlers. Comes with cap that prevents it from spilling into curler bag.</li>
            <li> My wife wanted a mister to set her mineral makeup. This was the right product at the price we wanted. The nozzle provides a very fine mist, and the tube goes firmly to the bottom so that not a drop is wasted. It holds about a cup of water, so it doesn&#x27;t have to be refilled very often.</li>
            <li> I use this with Witch Hazel. Love it. Makes a nice mist.</li>
            <li> I use this mister to  spray acrylic paint palette and paper to keep paint moist, or to create special effects.  The mist comes out wide and even.  It&#x27;s perfect for my purposes.</li>
            <li> Purchased a 3 pack and all three bottles &amp;#34;spit&amp;#34; liquid. There is no mist at all. These are junk avoid at all cost!</li>
            <li> works great, spritz my plants with it, perfect. hard on the thumb/finger though if u need to spray alot.</li>
            <li> Product came as expected and I have not had any problems with it whatsoever. I use it to mist my plants and it works well doing so.</li>
            <li> I bought this bottle for misting my face with an olive oil and water solution and this bottle is perfect!</li>
            <li> we use our homemade diaper spray solution and needed a spray bottle for it. this works great. small enough to store easily but holds just the right amount. its never leaked and still sprays so for the price it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> perfect for rubbing alcohol to spray makeup and tools for cleaning and sanitizing. very clear appearance to the bottle looks nice. fin mist.</li>
            <li> I have been using this frequently for over a month and the pump is leaking. Otherwise provides a nice, fine mist.</li>
            <li> Really good spray bottle. Very fine,even mist. Worth the cost and the wait.</li>
