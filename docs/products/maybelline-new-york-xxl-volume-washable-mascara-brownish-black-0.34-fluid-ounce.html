            <li>you know I am cute</li>
            <li>I have been having a lot  of eye infections so I am using more organic products now.</li>
            <li>Just ok.. I dont mind it on occasion</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara and was vert dissapointed when I could not find it anyplace in the stores,,was very surprised and happy to see it on line</li>
            <li>Removes easily with soap and water or oil-free eye makeup remover,  I don&#x27;t have the fullest lashes</li>
            <li>It stays on until it is washed off easily.  </li>
            <li>This mascara will build up a fair amount of volume - more than I want, actually!  </li>
            <li>And everyone noticed right away that I was wearing makeup!</li>
            <li>When I found it on amazon for such a good price, I ordered five tubes.  </li>
            <li>Not bad I like the product and price.</li>
            <li>It came rather quickly</li>
            <li>gives me full lashes right away.</li>
            <li>but it dried up real quick and didn&#x27;t do anything amazing for me.</li>
            <li>and it was shipped out super fast.  </li>
            <li>Received a different kind of Maybelline mascara than what I ordered; however would have cost too much to return</li>
            <li>Brown does not accentuate eyes very much.</li>
            <li>The only mascara I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t smudge is Cargo better than waterproof</li>
            <li>It makes my lashes look LONG :)</li>
            <li>The price was right &amp; I highly recommend purchasing this product from this seller.  </li>
            <li>I love how long it makes my lashes look!</li>
            <li>REALLY BUMMED ME OUT.</li>
            <li>It separates your lashes well and applies a reasonable amount of mascara with one application.</li>
            <li>I got used to that really fast and would buy again.</li>
            <li>Shiping was fast, I would recomend for everyone to buy this product.</li>
            <li>Not so much with this product.</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara I received from the seller.  </li>
            <li>so much had to buy for a friend in fla who couldnt find it</li>
            <li>only black &amp; since I&#x27;m not a brunette, have blue eyes &amp; am older, so I thought it better to stick w/a good thing for me.  </li>
            <li>I tried using my old mascara after using this, but there was no comparison.</li>
            <li>&amp; I could tell it was new &amp; not something old that was sitting around for a long time.  </li>
            <li>and instead i felt like i was just coating my lashes with barely noticeable mascara.  </li>
            <li>but after a couple of coats my skimpy lashes look if not exactly luxurious then certainly thicker and longer.</li>

            <li> If there&#x27;s any downside at all, it&#x27;s that it doesn&#x27;t last terribly long, probably because it&#x27;s a two-in-one product.  </li>
            <li> I wear (brownish black), so I tried a variety of other mascaras and nothing came close to making my eyes stand out as much as this product.  </li>
            <li> it seems a lil dry.  </li>

            <li> I AM A STRAWBERRY BLONDE, AND PERFER TO WEAR BROWNISH BLACK MASCARA.</li>
            <li> just brush on the white step one then immediately apply step two the brownish black color.</li>
            <li> I expected lengthening mascara</li>
            <li> but it does not really add any volume to my eye lashes.</li>
            <li> I find that it smudged just as much as other mascaras and coat number 2 made no difference.  </li>
            <li> so this is typical.  </li>
            <li> A disappointment in that Mabelline is usually a pretty reliable product.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if its older, or if I got a bad batch, or if this is just the mascara, but it flakes in my eyes and it takes several coats to even start to look like there is anything on my lashes.</li>
            <li> Only bad thing is was the package looked old.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;base coat\\&quot; makes a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> I recommend just ordering a few tubes at once</li>
            <li> I ordered this for myself as it&#x27;s hard to find this color instead of</li>
            <li> Not thrilled at all with this mascara.  </li>
            <li> I mean it&#x27;s mascara</li>
            <li> and it is very hard to find now...............</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> Sweep microfiber basecoat onto lashes to build dramatic volume.</li>
            <li> This mascara became impossible to find in stores in the color</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I hate removing it because I feel like I am pulling my eyelashes out.  </li>

            <li> I love this mascara and was vert dissapointed when I could not find it anyplace in the stores,,was very surprised and happy to see it on line</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It makes my lashes look LONG :)&lt;br /&gt; o o o o o o o o o o o</li>
            <li> I AM A STRAWBERRY BLONDE, AND PERFER TO WEAR BROWNISH BLACK MASCARA. THIS IS THE ONLY ONE I CAN FIND AND TO FIND OUT IT WAS BEING DISCONTINUED IN THE STORES REALLY BUMMED ME OUT. GLAD I FOUND IT ON YOUR WEBSITE, PLEASE DON&#x27;T GET RID OF IT!</li>
            <li> Maravillosos comprenlo.</li>
            <li> Its a great mascara and it was shipped out super fast.  The product is long lasting &amp; I would definitely reorder it.</li>
            <li> And everyone noticed right away that I was wearing makeup! My mom said &amp;#34;Did you do some thing different? Are you wearing makeup?&amp;#34; Then asked what I was wearing and wanted to buy some too!  Only bad thing is was the package looked old. I found out that the product is discontinued so I&#x27;m not sure how old it is.</li>
            <li> Not thrilled at all with this mascara.  I don&#x27;t know if its older, or if I got a bad batch, or if this is just the mascara, but it flakes in my eyes and it takes several coats to even start to look like there is anything on my lashes.</li>
            <li> I expected lengthening mascara and instead i felt like i was just coating my lashes with barely noticeable mascara.  I have used products like this before (Loreal) that worked much better.</li>
            <li> I ordered the XXL Maybelline Mascara through Amazon because I wasn&#x27;t able to find it in my area.  I&#x27;m love this mascara because of having two ends.  Step 1: Sweep microfiber basecoat onto lashes to build dramatic volume. Step 2: Follow with microfiber topcoat to lock on super-intense color. Removes easily with soap and water or oil-free eye makeup remover,  I don&#x27;t have the fullest lashes so having one end helping to build volume is great.  This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered this mascara and plan to order in the future.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I only use one side of it (the lengthening  side) but after a couple of coats my skimpy lashes look if not exactly luxurious then certainly thicker and longer.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with this product. It separates your lashes well and applies a reasonable amount of mascara with one application.</li>
            <li> OFast shipping.  So that was really nice ibdont like the #2 part it seems a lil dry.  So try it for yourself.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and just what I wanted!!!This product is something I have used for years and it is very hard to find now...............</li>
            <li> This is the only mascara I like because of the white basecoat.  Since it has been discontinued, I bought a life time supply for the next 20 years!  Do not use my name in the review.</li>
            <li> I bought six of these and have never tried it before. gives me full lashes right away. dont need to wait to apply second coat. just brush on the white step one then immediately apply step two the brownish black color. washes off  nicely too. the tube was slightly clumsy at first as it opens on both ends. I got used to that really fast and would buy again.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite mascara for years.  The \\&quot;base coat\\&quot; makes a huge difference.  This mascara became impossible to find in stores in the color I wear (brownish black), so I tried a variety of other mascaras and nothing came close to making my eyes stand out as much as this product.  When I found it on amazon for such a good price, I ordered five tubes.  If there&#x27;s any downside at all, it&#x27;s that it doesn&#x27;t last terribly long, probably because it&#x27;s a two-in-one product.  I recommend just ordering a few tubes at once so you always have a spare.</li>
            <li> This product works beautifully.  I am extremely happy with it.  It stays on until it is washed off easily.  The cost was unbeatable and the quality ois outstanding.  I am thinking of stocking up on this product, and would recommend it to anyone who wears make-up.</li>
            <li> This mascara will build up a fair amount of volume - more than I want, actually!  It does tend to flake a bit.</li>
            <li> I alway love this mascara and I still love it and it give me a cute look buy you know I am cute</li>
            <li> I gave this a go but it dried up real quick and didn&#x27;t do anything amazing for me. I have been having a lot  of eye infections so I am using more organic products now.</li>
            <li> Came unsealed. Don&#x27;t know if I should use it.</li>
            <li> Just ok.. I dont mind it on occasion but it does not really add any volume to my eye lashes. Brown does not accentuate eyes very much.</li>
            <li> Not bad I like the product and price. Shiping was fast, I would recomend for everyone to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Too gloppy for me.  A disappointment in that Mabelline is usually a pretty reliable product.  Not so much with this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for myself as it&#x27;s hard to find this color instead of only black &amp; since I&#x27;m not a brunette, have blue eyes &amp; am older, so I thought it better to stick w/a good thing for me.  I really like this mascara I received from the seller.  It came rather quickly &amp; I could tell it was new &amp; not something old that was sitting around for a long time.  The price was right &amp; I highly recommend purchasing this product from this seller.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Received a different kind of Maybelline mascara than what I ordered; however would have cost too much to return so I&#x27;m just dealing with it.  Not happy.</li>
            <li> I get raccoon eyes when I wear this products.  I get raccoom eyes with lots of mascara so this is typical.  I find that it smudged just as much as other mascaras and coat number 2 made no difference.  The only mascara I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t smudge is Cargo better than waterproof but I hate removing it because I feel like I am pulling my eyelashes out.  I&#x27;m trying the Clinique no smudge and it&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li> this is great i like it so much had to buy for a friend in fla who couldnt find it</li>
            <li> I love how long it makes my lashes look! I tried using my old mascara after using this, but there was no comparison.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was a great deal but I honestly don&#x27;t care for it.  I mean it&#x27;s mascara and sure it works nice but I don&#x27;t like the double sided deal.</li>
