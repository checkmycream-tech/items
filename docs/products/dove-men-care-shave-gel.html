    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I am very happy with this product.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>That said, it&#x27;s some of the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was very impressed with the men+care shave gel.  </li>
            <li>Hubby said this Dove Shave Gel is awesome.  </li>
            <li>Not the best shave gel but does the trick.</li>
            <li>The men in our lives deserve great skin too!</li>
            <li>I have always liked Dove products, so was very happy when I saw they came out with a mens line to buy for my son.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Smells great and leathers up my face.</li>
            <li>Great gel.  </li>
            <li>This product worked out great for him.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great.</li>
            <li>Great stuff and smells great.</li>
            <li>This will be a great product.</li>
            <li>This is a great shave gel/foam.</li>
            <li>And comnined with the Dove Men after shave balm, my skin felt and looked great.</li>
            <li>This would make a very nice gift for my husband.</li>
            <li>I tend to like shaving products that mostly stay in gel or lotion form, since they lead to the best outcomes.  </li>
            <li>Much more impressed by Dove Men&#x27;s shave gel than their \\&quot;Hydrate\\</li>
            <li>I like shaving with Hydrate gel because everything else I&#x27;ve tried doesn&#x27;t feel good while shaving.</li>
            <li>Also leaves skin feeling good, without drying.  </li>
            <li>Good Product.</li>
            <li>it foams and the product looks good on my counter.</li>
            <li>Just the right texture and amount of lather for a perfect shave with no bumps or nicks.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant and relaxing, the gel turns into an incredibly rich cream-like lather, and boy does it soothe skin!</li>
            <li>I got to say this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell to it too...</li>
            <li>really liked this shaving gel.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Also it smells nice.</li>
            <li>Known for products that are kind to our skin, this shaving gel follows the rest of the product family under the toughest conditions -</li>
            <li>Though it&#x27;s written in a dated style, and could do with more illustrations, it makes a good primer for shaving techniques your daddy never taught</li>
            <li>It even smells nice.</li>
            <li>However, what I&#x27;ve written here should constitute a good learning kit, as I&#x27;ve found it all, working together, conspires to give me a shave that&#x27;s a pleasure while it&#x27;s in process, and leaves my skin baby smooth afterward.</li>

            <li>After using this shaving gel with Schick Hydro 5 Blade Razor I get a good clean shaving.</li>
            <li>Really love this shaving gel.</li>
            <li>This requires mixing in your hand or on your face and is just more work in the morning that I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>The more \\&quot;hydrating\\&quot; shave gels/</li>
            <li>but the Axe shave gels all have a stronger, more noticeable scent.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I have been impressed with all the Dove for Men products I have tried and definitely will be using them again.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>Sooooo much better than the Nivea for Men</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, many shaving products but none have worked.</li>
            <li>Perhaps is was because I&#x27;d been burned by so many inferior products in the past.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only does it deliver the perfect amount every time, but it doesn&#x27;t leave any residual gel on the dispenser to clog it up.</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;Quality of lather is OK for price paid</li>
            <li>Gillette seems to be better for me.</li>
            <li>good-quality stuff is pricy, but I&#x27;ve found it worthwhile.</li>
            <li>good-quality stuff is pricy, but I&#x27;ve found it worthwhile.</li>
            <li>I like how it doesn&#x27;t need a lot of foam to be effective and it leaves my skin feeling moisturized and smooth .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several products for men, looking for the best thing to use to shave with.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve use Neutrogena for awhile which is pretty good</li>
            <li>This is a really nice shaving gel that works quickly and well.</li>
            <li>I recently tried DOVE&#x27;s MEN +CARE Hydrate+ shaving gel and found it to be very good for lubricating the skin so the razor can glide smoothly and do its&#x27; job more</li>
            <li>The Dove Men+Care shaving cream is a great for those who have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable and comparable to others and the Dove name is one that I always get good quality with.</li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t like this quite as much as I like Axe shaving gel, this is still quite a good shaving gel.</li>
            <li>The razor glide is very smooth and painful/irritating razor pull is non-existent, a feeling I haven&#x27;t experienced since before I started growing facial hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shaving Made Easy -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy on my face and to shave with.</li>
            <li>Nothing strong or offensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This shave gel is very gentle on the skin and has a nice smell.  </li>
            <li>It has a great fragrance and pretty much what you expect out of Dove.</li>
            <li>This does just as well, and it&#x27;s way less in price - great buy!</li>
            <li>The advantage here, besides light weight and easy grip, is the changeable single-edge blade.</li>
            <li>goes on really well and creates a nice foam, easy to shave with.</li>
            <li>I am able to get the smooth super close shave I need.  </li>
            <li>Very comfortable shave, won&#x27;t dry skin, eliminates razor burn, smells great, rinses clean and won&#x27;t kill the wallet.</li>
            <li>Evalley Men&#x27;s Stainless Steel Shaving Cup]], which, being metal, retains the heat of your hot-water shave quite nicely, and helps me work up a rich lather that&#x27;s both easy to use, and a pleasure to apply.</li>

            <li>/&gt;Pleasant scent&lt;br /&gt;Quick and easy clean</li>
            <li>My face is smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very expensive and it works better than most shaving creams I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Both were good at protecting my face and leaving it feeling shaved close but not tight or \\&quot;burned\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>The dove gel is a quick and easy clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the first thing I love about the gel.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but judging from the results I got from the shave gel, I&#x27;m excited to see how this product delivers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it did not irritate my skin and the remainder washed off cleanly.  </li>
            <li>As far as being cost-effective, you won&#x27;t find a better product!</li>
            <li>Straight razors are more unique.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll look twice at their products in the future after the good results I got</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll look twice at their products in the future after the good results I got here.</li>
            <li>a small amount of product foams to create enough to cover your face, and is a perfect match for any razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a close shave that leaves your face feeling smooth, this product gives amazing per use value from the generous size can.</li>
            <li>It lathers alot and has a nice fragrance while giving him a nice clean shave and leaving his face feeling soft and not dry.  </li>
            <li>The smell is fresh and clean but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Dove Men&#x27;s Care Sensitive Shave Gel is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>We have also noticed that the hair doesn&#x27;t grow in as quickly when he uses this product, and it is softer when it does come in.</li>
            <li>The scent is mild but manly.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and clings pretty well for use.</li>
            <li>At my age, for the first time, I enjoy shaving.</li>
            <li>liked this variety a little bit better because my face felt noticeably smoother afterwards.  </li>
            <li>very manly and not feminine, which was important to my husband, as he was leery about using something that would make him smell &amp;#34;girly.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I used Gillette&#x27;s sensitive skin gel, but I won&#x27;t any more.</li>
            <li>He got a nice, close shave without any of the unpleasantness that comes with traditional shaving cream.</li>
            <li>They are both good products for the price and do much the same thing.  </li>
            <li>Dove smells really good and is very affordable for people who don&#x27;t want to spend the extra money.</li>
            <li>Scent is manly but mild; its very much like the Ocean bodywash also made by Dove.  </li>
            <li>Turns out, having a beard is more work, not less.</li>
            <li>I used to avoid shaving with manual razors at all cost because my skin gets irritated that easily, and I&#x27;ve used just about every kind of gel/cream imaginable including $6-$7 Gillette and Nivea products that are half of the size of this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line; if you are seeking relief for your sensitive skin, or just want a superior quality shave from a budget friendly product I would highly recommend you take this Dove Men+Care Sensitive shave gel into consideration.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First the gel comes out in just the right amount.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells right.</li>
            <li>The book above makes good suggestions for choosing a razor, but I&#x27;ve found satisfaction with [[ASIN:B002ONHBBW Parker&#x27;s Stainless Steel Straight Razor]].</li>
            <li>This new Dove Men+Care Sensitive Shave Gel is hands down the best shave gel I have ever used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, I was curious so I tried some of it on my legs, and it was wonderful (other than the &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; smell).</li>
            <li>Both types saturate the beard well too, helping you get a closer shave on the first pass with the razor.  </li>
            <li>The Hyrdating Gel simply felt better.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I finally found Dove Men+Care Hydrate + Shave Gel.  </li>
            <li>Shaving hasn&#x27;t been this slow-going since I first tried it as a kid; but it hasn&#x27;r.</li>
            <li>Shaving hasn&#x27;t been this slow-going since I first tried it as a kid; but it hasn&#x27;t been this pleasurable EVER.</li>
            <li>The scent is mild and barely noticeable but be warned, the button on top doesn&#x27;t need much of a touch to dispense and the gel really foams up, so you don&#x27;t need as much as you think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent is light and not strong or overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Even though their scent dissipates over time, the Dove scent is barely there, leaving you free to wear whatever scents you choose to without having to work around the spiciness of the Axe gels.  </li>
            <li>here.ove scent is barely there, leaving you free to wear whatever scents you choose to without having to work around the spiciness of the Axe gels.  </li>
            <li>first lesson with the straight razor: don&#x27;t overlook your foam.</li>
            <li>Too many shaving creams are dry, but not this one.</li>
            <li>It mostly comes down to personal budget and opinion when it comes to shaving products, but this new Dove Men+Care Sensitive Shave Gel is worth consideration if you&#x27;re looking for a nice shave gel that won&#x27;t murder your face.</li>
            <li>Overall this product resembles the quality of a product like Beard Lube by Jack Black, but at a fraction of the cost, it&#x27;s definitely the best bang for the buck in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Like all Dove products it is gentle, with little odor, it is clean, easy to apply and remove.</li>
            <li>and I really like it as well.</li>
            <li>have found that you don&#x27;t really need to use a lot of water at all to make it lather well.  </li>
            <li>In fact, it doesn&#x27;t take too much water to make it &amp;#34;too watery&amp;#34; for me.</li>
            <li>This shaving gel feels as the label reads, very hydrating.  </li>
            <li>My husband absolutely loves this shave gel.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You can really feel the hydration when you apply this shaving gel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s shave cream, what can you really say.</li>
            <li>but I also tend to use the mens shave gel when I run out of mine and have tried this to find I really like it also.  </li>
            <li>I found the lubricating quality of the gel to be higher than the normal soap foam variety.&lt;br</li>
            <li>While at the same time leaving my skin feeling hydrated and free from irritation.  </li>
            <li>&quot; You can&#x27;t do that with a straight razor.</li>
            <li>Also, the multi-stage shaving regimen is a real sensual pleasure, in a way safety rasor shaving just isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>Also, the multi-stage shaving regimen is a real sensual pleasure, in a way safety rasor shaving just isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>Most shave gels are a notch above old school shaving cream (which still works in a pinch).  </li>
            <li>Lather is good, but not so thick that you can&#x27;t see where you&#x27;re shaving like with many other shave gels &amp; creams.</li>
            <li>I felt like the razor glided very easily through without any discomfort despite the lesser &amp;#34;volume&amp;#34; of traditional shaving creams,</li>
            <li>Like many other men I cannot get a satisfactory shave using an electric razor</li>
            <li>Very gentle and not harsh, not sticky but foamy.</li>
            <li>This is nice because the closer you can shave on the first pass, the less likely you are to nick yourself or \\&quot;burn\\</li>
            <li>Final opinion will always come down to personal taste, but if you&#x27;re looking for the best bang for your buck, look absolutely no further!</li>
            <li>He said it goes on smooth and helps his face not feel dry after shaving...and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>definitely think that is product is better than Gillette or Axe, which is what he was using prior to this and seems to be comparable in price to those.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not quite as foamy as a traditional shaving cream such as barbasol, but rather a silky, creamy consistency which was refreshing.  </li>
            <li>Since it doesn&#x27;t need stropping, it&#x27;s low maintenance, and you can graduate to authentic blue steel</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a good product with only a minor downside.</li>
            <li>highly recommend you try it.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and others like it in the Dove Men+Care skin line.</li>
            <li>I purchased a can of the Sensitive variant of this Dove Men+Care shave gel, and I can&#x27;t say that it works better than any other canned goo on the shelf.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Hydrating formula seemed to do it a little bit better and therefore this is the can I would reach for when I run out of Shave Gel.  </li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great for your skin, the gel oozes out like runny snot, and runs down the side of the can and makes a mess.</li>
            <li>So far I really like this and the cent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a normal non-perfumey or non-feminine scent to it.</li>
            <li>If you manage to get any on your face, it&#x27;s pretty much the same story.</li>
            <li>I am not a big fan of gel shaving cream but this formula lathers up with only a small amount leaving my face feeling great after shaving and without much residue.  </li>
            <li>They really need to make this exact product and market it towards women, with different packaging and scent!</li>
            <li>The narrow edge and tetchy qualities make for a more intensive process.</li>
            <li>So Dove is definitely doing something right to have earned a spot as a mainstay in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>It gives me a remarkably smooth shave compared to other gels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would recommend either one to someone looking to try out a new shave gel or somebody looking for a gel that will help them get a closer hsave without irritation.  </li>
            <li>If you really want to shave with a straight razor, may I suggest starting with the book [[ASIN:1475109849 The Art of Shaving:</li>
            <li>Having all four is something of an indulgence, but especially if you want to look professional and trustworthy--or if you want to have your sweetheart touch your face plenty--the indulgence is worth it.</li>
            <li>Having all four is something of an indulgence, but especially if you want to look professional and trustworthy--or if you want to have your sweetheart touch your face plenty--the indulgence is worth it.</li>
            <li>Surprise was the first reaction, and those who would comply would always say the same thing..</li>
            <li>I found this to be better than the quality of the shave gel that I usually get.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve have some aftershaves that were terribly messy and a real hassle too clean up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the appropriate amount of masculine, but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>First published in 1905, it offers step-by-step instructions in actually shaving without nicking yourself like a pincushion.</li>
            <li>scent is pleasant, vaguely aftershave-ish, without being too overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>A co-worker talked up the value of a single-edge straight razor to maintain a crisp, professional-looking edge on my facial hair, especially for men like me with wiry beard hair and copious neck beard.</li>
            <li>/&gt;\\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li>/&gt;After shaving, My skin feels baby soft.</li>
            <li>soft skin</li>
            <li>B00A0J09F2 Dove Men+Care Sensitive + Shave Gel]]</li>
            <li>am personally a big fan or Dove products and I really like this shave gel because it worked for my problem.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much issue with hydration nor was that something specific I was wanting from this product</li>
            <li>Overall, I really like this shave gel from Dove and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>To say that my skin is sensitive is an understatement.</li>
            <li>The scent was reasonably subdued and did not linger after the final rinse.  </li>
            <li>At my age, I&#x27;m finally learning to shave with a straight razor.</li>
            <li>Also, turns out, shaving with a straight razor isn&#x27;t essentially similar to shaving with a disposable safety</li>
            <li>/&gt;Obviously, this isn&#x27;t a complete instruction on straight-razor shaving.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Obviously, this isn&#x27;t a complete instruction on straight-razor shaving.</li>
            <li>but the Dove gel far surpasses it.</li>
            <li>Both have a mild scent that is much less noticeable than the Axe Shave Gels.  </li>
            <li>Simply rub it in your hands then apply it as you normally would.</li>
            <li>Another thing I liked is the unique pump on the top, which seems to prevent that slow, annoying leakage of additional foam after you&#x27;re done dispensing, which is a great touch because I always found that so annoying.  </li>
            <li>It was a experiment in which I approach a complete stranger of the opposite sex, and after a couple minutes of talking, invite them to feel my face.</li>
            <li>I recommend this shave gel to anyone, especially if you have have sensitive skin and crave that close shave.</li>
            <li>The smell is barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>Kind of REALLY expensive for canned shave gel that doesn&#x27;t outperform others.</li>
            <li>Disposable safety razors are all more or less the same, and all equally annoying; you can get a good shave, but at the cost of tender, abraded skin.</li>
            <li>Lots of stubble left following a shave with a brand new, out-of-the-box</li>
            <li>and unlike some other gels, it doesn&#x27;t get very sticky on your face.  </li>
            <li>If you brish the cream directly onto your skin, it won&#x27;t foam up, and it&#x27;ll actually make shaving more difficult, not less.</li>
            <li>If you brish the cream directly onto your skin, it won&#x27;t foam up, and it&#x27;ll actually make shaving more difficult, not less.</li>
            <li>Left no feelings of irritation and left the skin feeling soft with no razor burn.</li>
            <li>It leaves his face moisturized and hydrated and not dry and peeling.</li>
            <li>It is thick, rich, and does not dry out in the middle of a shave.</li>
            <li>They would generally dissipate and go away the next day or so</li>
            <li>I am not  a fan, foam never gets rich or thick, seems like the container is not pressurized enough</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;- Call me crazy, but when I see a product marked \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot; with a white label of some kind, I assume the product will be fragrance-free and possibly dye-free.</li>
            <li>As someone who has always suffered with dry sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The razor just glides over it, and it is very soothing if you shave a little closer than you intended.</li>
            <li>It only takes a little but works really well.  </li>
            <li>You only have to use a little bit of this in order to cover your whole face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> I am very happy with this product.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> That said, it&#x27;s some of the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with the men+care shave gel.  </li>
            <li> Hubby said this Dove Shave Gel is awesome.  </li>
            <li> Not the best shave gel but does the trick.</li>
            <li> The men in our lives deserve great skin too!</li>
            <li> I have always liked Dove products, so was very happy when I saw they came out with a mens line to buy for my son.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Smells great and leathers up my face.</li>
            <li> Great gel.  </li>
            <li> This product worked out great for him.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.</li>
            <li> Great stuff and smells great.</li>
            <li> This will be a great product.</li>
            <li> This is a great shave gel/foam.</li>
            <li> And comnined with the Dove Men after shave balm, my skin felt and looked great.</li>
            <li> This would make a very nice gift for my husband.</li>
            <li> I tend to like shaving products that mostly stay in gel or lotion form, since they lead to the best outcomes.  </li>
            <li> Much more impressed by Dove Men&#x27;s shave gel than their \\&quot;Hydrate\\</li>
            <li> I like shaving with Hydrate gel because everything else I&#x27;ve tried doesn&#x27;t feel good while shaving.</li>
            <li> Also leaves skin feeling good, without drying.  </li>
            <li> Good Product.</li>
            <li> it foams and the product looks good on my counter.</li>
            <li> Just the right texture and amount of lather for a perfect shave with no bumps or nicks.</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant and relaxing, the gel turns into an incredibly rich cream-like lather, and boy does it soothe skin!</li>
            <li> I got to say this product is amazing.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell to it too...</li>
            <li> really liked this shaving gel.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Also it smells nice.</li>
            <li> Known for products that are kind to our skin, this shaving gel follows the rest of the product family under the toughest conditions -</li>
            <li> Though it&#x27;s written in a dated style, and could do with more illustrations, it makes a good primer for shaving techniques your daddy never taught</li>
            <li> It even smells nice.</li>
            <li> However, what I&#x27;ve written here should constitute a good learning kit, as I&#x27;ve found it all, working together, conspires to give me a shave that&#x27;s a pleasure while it&#x27;s in process, and leaves my skin baby smooth afterward.</li>

            <li> After using this shaving gel with Schick Hydro 5 Blade Razor I get a good clean shaving.</li>
            <li> Really love this shaving gel.</li>
            <li> This requires mixing in your hand or on your face and is just more work in the morning that I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> The more \\&quot;hydrating\\&quot; shave gels/</li>
            <li> but the Axe shave gels all have a stronger, more noticeable scent.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I have been impressed with all the Dove for Men products I have tried and definitely will be using them again.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Sooooo much better than the Nivea for Men</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, many shaving products but none have worked.</li>
            <li> Perhaps is was because I&#x27;d been burned by so many inferior products in the past.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not only does it deliver the perfect amount every time, but it doesn&#x27;t leave any residual gel on the dispenser to clog it up.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;Quality of lather is OK for price paid</li>
            <li> Gillette seems to be better for me.</li>
            <li> good-quality stuff is pricy, but I&#x27;ve found it worthwhile.</li>
            <li> good-quality stuff is pricy, but I&#x27;ve found it worthwhile.</li>
            <li> I like how it doesn&#x27;t need a lot of foam to be effective and it leaves my skin feeling moisturized and smooth .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several products for men, looking for the best thing to use to shave with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use Neutrogena for awhile which is pretty good</li>
            <li> This is a really nice shaving gel that works quickly and well.</li>
            <li> I recently tried DOVE&#x27;s MEN +CARE Hydrate+ shaving gel and found it to be very good for lubricating the skin so the razor can glide smoothly and do its&#x27; job more</li>
            <li> The Dove Men+Care shaving cream is a great for those who have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable and comparable to others and the Dove name is one that I always get good quality with.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t like this quite as much as I like Axe shaving gel, this is still quite a good shaving gel.</li>
            <li> The razor glide is very smooth and painful/irritating razor pull is non-existent, a feeling I haven&#x27;t experienced since before I started growing facial hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shaving Made Easy -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy on my face and to shave with.</li>
            <li> Nothing strong or offensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This shave gel is very gentle on the skin and has a nice smell.  </li>
            <li> It has a great fragrance and pretty much what you expect out of Dove.</li>
            <li> This does just as well, and it&#x27;s way less in price - great buy!</li>
            <li> The advantage here, besides light weight and easy grip, is the changeable single-edge blade.</li>
            <li> goes on really well and creates a nice foam, easy to shave with.</li>
            <li> I am able to get the smooth super close shave I need.  </li>
            <li> Very comfortable shave, won&#x27;t dry skin, eliminates razor burn, smells great, rinses clean and won&#x27;t kill the wallet.</li>
            <li> Evalley Men&#x27;s Stainless Steel Shaving Cup]], which, being metal, retains the heat of your hot-water shave quite nicely, and helps me work up a rich lather that&#x27;s both easy to use, and a pleasure to apply.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Pleasant scent&lt;br /&gt;Quick and easy clean</li>
            <li> My face is smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very expensive and it works better than most shaving creams I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Both were good at protecting my face and leaving it feeling shaved close but not tight or \\&quot;burned\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> The dove gel is a quick and easy clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the first thing I love about the gel.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but judging from the results I got from the shave gel, I&#x27;m excited to see how this product delivers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it did not irritate my skin and the remainder washed off cleanly.  </li>
            <li> As far as being cost-effective, you won&#x27;t find a better product!</li>
            <li> Straight razors are more unique.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll look twice at their products in the future after the good results I got</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll look twice at their products in the future after the good results I got here.</li>
            <li> a small amount of product foams to create enough to cover your face, and is a perfect match for any razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a close shave that leaves your face feeling smooth, this product gives amazing per use value from the generous size can.</li>
            <li> It lathers alot and has a nice fragrance while giving him a nice clean shave and leaving his face feeling soft and not dry.  </li>
            <li> The smell is fresh and clean but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> Dove Men&#x27;s Care Sensitive Shave Gel is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> We have also noticed that the hair doesn&#x27;t grow in as quickly when he uses this product, and it is softer when it does come in.</li>
            <li> The scent is mild but manly.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and clings pretty well for use.</li>
            <li> At my age, for the first time, I enjoy shaving.</li>
            <li> liked this variety a little bit better because my face felt noticeably smoother afterwards.  </li>
            <li> very manly and not feminine, which was important to my husband, as he was leery about using something that would make him smell &amp;#34;girly.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I used Gillette&#x27;s sensitive skin gel, but I won&#x27;t any more.</li>
            <li> He got a nice, close shave without any of the unpleasantness that comes with traditional shaving cream.</li>
            <li> They are both good products for the price and do much the same thing.  </li>
            <li> Dove smells really good and is very affordable for people who don&#x27;t want to spend the extra money.</li>
            <li> Scent is manly but mild; its very much like the Ocean bodywash also made by Dove.  </li>
            <li> Turns out, having a beard is more work, not less.</li>
            <li> I used to avoid shaving with manual razors at all cost because my skin gets irritated that easily, and I&#x27;ve used just about every kind of gel/cream imaginable including $6-$7 Gillette and Nivea products that are half of the size of this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line; if you are seeking relief for your sensitive skin, or just want a superior quality shave from a budget friendly product I would highly recommend you take this Dove Men+Care Sensitive shave gel into consideration.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First the gel comes out in just the right amount.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells right.</li>
            <li> The book above makes good suggestions for choosing a razor, but I&#x27;ve found satisfaction with [[ASIN:B002ONHBBW Parker&#x27;s Stainless Steel Straight Razor]].</li>
            <li> This new Dove Men+Care Sensitive Shave Gel is hands down the best shave gel I have ever used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, I was curious so I tried some of it on my legs, and it was wonderful (other than the &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; smell).</li>
            <li> Both types saturate the beard well too, helping you get a closer shave on the first pass with the razor.  </li>
            <li> The Hyrdating Gel simply felt better.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I finally found Dove Men+Care Hydrate + Shave Gel.  </li>
            <li> Shaving hasn&#x27;t been this slow-going since I first tried it as a kid; but it hasn&#x27;r.</li>
            <li> Shaving hasn&#x27;t been this slow-going since I first tried it as a kid; but it hasn&#x27;t been this pleasurable EVER.</li>
            <li> The scent is mild and barely noticeable but be warned, the button on top doesn&#x27;t need much of a touch to dispense and the gel really foams up, so you don&#x27;t need as much as you think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent is light and not strong or overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Even though their scent dissipates over time, the Dove scent is barely there, leaving you free to wear whatever scents you choose to without having to work around the spiciness of the Axe gels.  </li>
            <li> here.ove scent is barely there, leaving you free to wear whatever scents you choose to without having to work around the spiciness of the Axe gels.  </li>
            <li> first lesson with the straight razor: don&#x27;t overlook your foam.</li>
            <li> Too many shaving creams are dry, but not this one.</li>
            <li> It mostly comes down to personal budget and opinion when it comes to shaving products, but this new Dove Men+Care Sensitive Shave Gel is worth consideration if you&#x27;re looking for a nice shave gel that won&#x27;t murder your face.</li>
            <li> Overall this product resembles the quality of a product like Beard Lube by Jack Black, but at a fraction of the cost, it&#x27;s definitely the best bang for the buck in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Like all Dove products it is gentle, with little odor, it is clean, easy to apply and remove.</li>
            <li> and I really like it as well.</li>
            <li> have found that you don&#x27;t really need to use a lot of water at all to make it lather well.  </li>
            <li> In fact, it doesn&#x27;t take too much water to make it &amp;#34;too watery&amp;#34; for me.</li>
            <li> This shaving gel feels as the label reads, very hydrating.  </li>
            <li> My husband absolutely loves this shave gel.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You can really feel the hydration when you apply this shaving gel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shave cream, what can you really say.</li>
            <li> but I also tend to use the mens shave gel when I run out of mine and have tried this to find I really like it also.  </li>
            <li> I found the lubricating quality of the gel to be higher than the normal soap foam variety.&lt;br</li>
            <li> While at the same time leaving my skin feeling hydrated and free from irritation.  </li>
            <li> &quot; You can&#x27;t do that with a straight razor.</li>
            <li> Also, the multi-stage shaving regimen is a real sensual pleasure, in a way safety rasor shaving just isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> Also, the multi-stage shaving regimen is a real sensual pleasure, in a way safety rasor shaving just isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> Most shave gels are a notch above old school shaving cream (which still works in a pinch).  </li>
            <li> Lather is good, but not so thick that you can&#x27;t see where you&#x27;re shaving like with many other shave gels &amp; creams.</li>
            <li> I felt like the razor glided very easily through without any discomfort despite the lesser &amp;#34;volume&amp;#34; of traditional shaving creams,</li>
            <li> Like many other men I cannot get a satisfactory shave using an electric razor</li>
            <li> Very gentle and not harsh, not sticky but foamy.</li>
            <li> This is nice because the closer you can shave on the first pass, the less likely you are to nick yourself or \\&quot;burn\\</li>
            <li> Final opinion will always come down to personal taste, but if you&#x27;re looking for the best bang for your buck, look absolutely no further!</li>
            <li> He said it goes on smooth and helps his face not feel dry after shaving...and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> definitely think that is product is better than Gillette or Axe, which is what he was using prior to this and seems to be comparable in price to those.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite as foamy as a traditional shaving cream such as barbasol, but rather a silky, creamy consistency which was refreshing.  </li>
            <li> Since it doesn&#x27;t need stropping, it&#x27;s low maintenance, and you can graduate to authentic blue steel</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a good product with only a minor downside.</li>
            <li> highly recommend you try it.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and others like it in the Dove Men+Care skin line.</li>
            <li> I purchased a can of the Sensitive variant of this Dove Men+Care shave gel, and I can&#x27;t say that it works better than any other canned goo on the shelf.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Hydrating formula seemed to do it a little bit better and therefore this is the can I would reach for when I run out of Shave Gel.  </li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great for your skin, the gel oozes out like runny snot, and runs down the side of the can and makes a mess.</li>
            <li> So far I really like this and the cent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a normal non-perfumey or non-feminine scent to it.</li>
            <li> If you manage to get any on your face, it&#x27;s pretty much the same story.</li>
            <li> I am not a big fan of gel shaving cream but this formula lathers up with only a small amount leaving my face feeling great after shaving and without much residue.  </li>
            <li> They really need to make this exact product and market it towards women, with different packaging and scent!</li>
            <li> The narrow edge and tetchy qualities make for a more intensive process.</li>
            <li> So Dove is definitely doing something right to have earned a spot as a mainstay in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> It gives me a remarkably smooth shave compared to other gels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would recommend either one to someone looking to try out a new shave gel or somebody looking for a gel that will help them get a closer hsave without irritation.  </li>
            <li> If you really want to shave with a straight razor, may I suggest starting with the book [[ASIN:1475109849 The Art of Shaving:</li>
            <li> Having all four is something of an indulgence, but especially if you want to look professional and trustworthy--or if you want to have your sweetheart touch your face plenty--the indulgence is worth it.</li>
            <li> Having all four is something of an indulgence, but especially if you want to look professional and trustworthy--or if you want to have your sweetheart touch your face plenty--the indulgence is worth it.</li>
            <li> Surprise was the first reaction, and those who would comply would always say the same thing..</li>
            <li> I found this to be better than the quality of the shave gel that I usually get.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve have some aftershaves that were terribly messy and a real hassle too clean up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the appropriate amount of masculine, but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> First published in 1905, it offers step-by-step instructions in actually shaving without nicking yourself like a pincushion.</li>
            <li> scent is pleasant, vaguely aftershave-ish, without being too overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> A co-worker talked up the value of a single-edge straight razor to maintain a crisp, professional-looking edge on my facial hair, especially for men like me with wiry beard hair and copious neck beard.</li>

            <li> am personally a big fan or Dove products and I really like this shave gel because it worked for my problem.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much issue with hydration nor was that something specific I was wanting from this product</li>
            <li> Overall, I really like this shave gel from Dove and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> To say that my skin is sensitive is an understatement.</li>
            <li> The scent was reasonably subdued and did not linger after the final rinse.  </li>
            <li> At my age, I&#x27;m finally learning to shave with a straight razor.</li>
            <li> Also, turns out, shaving with a straight razor isn&#x27;t essentially similar to shaving with a disposable safety</li>
            <li> /&gt;Obviously, this isn&#x27;t a complete instruction on straight-razor shaving.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Obviously, this isn&#x27;t a complete instruction on straight-razor shaving.</li>
            <li> but the Dove gel far surpasses it.</li>
            <li> Both have a mild scent that is much less noticeable than the Axe Shave Gels.  </li>
            <li> Simply rub it in your hands then apply it as you normally would.</li>
            <li> Another thing I liked is the unique pump on the top, which seems to prevent that slow, annoying leakage of additional foam after you&#x27;re done dispensing, which is a great touch because I always found that so annoying.  </li>
            <li> It was a experiment in which I approach a complete stranger of the opposite sex, and after a couple minutes of talking, invite them to feel my face.</li>
            <li> I recommend this shave gel to anyone, especially if you have have sensitive skin and crave that close shave.</li>
            <li> The smell is barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> Kind of REALLY expensive for canned shave gel that doesn&#x27;t outperform others.</li>
            <li> Disposable safety razors are all more or less the same, and all equally annoying; you can get a good shave, but at the cost of tender, abraded skin.</li>
            <li> Lots of stubble left following a shave with a brand new, out-of-the-box</li>
            <li> and unlike some other gels, it doesn&#x27;t get very sticky on your face.  </li>
            <li> If you brish the cream directly onto your skin, it won&#x27;t foam up, and it&#x27;ll actually make shaving more difficult, not less.</li>
            <li> If you brish the cream directly onto your skin, it won&#x27;t foam up, and it&#x27;ll actually make shaving more difficult, not less.</li>
            <li> Left no feelings of irritation and left the skin feeling soft with no razor burn.</li>
            <li> It leaves his face moisturized and hydrated and not dry and peeling.</li>
            <li> It is thick, rich, and does not dry out in the middle of a shave.</li>
            <li> They would generally dissipate and go away the next day or so</li>
            <li> I am not  a fan, foam never gets rich or thick, seems like the container is not pressurized enough</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;- Call me crazy, but when I see a product marked \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot; with a white label of some kind, I assume the product will be fragrance-free and possibly dye-free.</li>
            <li> As someone who has always suffered with dry sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The razor just glides over it, and it is very soothing if you shave a little closer than you intended.</li>
            <li> It only takes a little but works really well.  </li>
            <li> You only have to use a little bit of this in order to cover your whole face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got in the habit of dry-shaving several years ago, but especially if you have thick, wiry facial hair like me, you absolutely need a foam.</li>
            <li> When I first used this shave gel, I made the mistake of pressing done on the nozzle too hard.</li>
            <li> ; Even if you are a typical man&#x27;s man, who isn&#x27;t all that into grooming and beauty products, you should still give this a try if you have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too expensive for what you get.&lt;br /&gt;However, it does give a smooth shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As for the shaving experience, I don&#x27;t believe there is anything noticeably different other than the fact that it provides a close shave.</li>
            <li> I usually use lotion after I shave because my face gets a bit sensitive, but it felt like I didn&#x27;t need it as my face felt lubricated even after I washed up.  </li>
            <li> Usually my skin feels irritated after I shave but with the Dove shaving cream it felt soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> it simply doesn&#x27;t stay on it but runs down like water.</li>
            <li> creams typically have a certain level of thickness that at least implies you&#x27;re getting a moisturizing/hydrating</li>
            <li> the Residue is minimal.</li>
            <li> With any other shaving cream I would get lot of cuts on face.</li>
            <li> I compared these every other day for two weeks before reaching that conclusion.  </li>
            <li> In my experience, Dove Men+ products are gentler on my skin than some of the other brands.  </li>
            <li> Because he is now looking for a new job, he needed to get rid of the perma stubble that the electric shaver leaves behind.</li>
            <li> He usually uses electric shavers or clippers because he has extremely sensitive skin, and shaving manually will usually result in a rash or pain.</li>
            <li> It was thick, heavy, and didn&#x27;t lather up much; \\&quot;shaving\\&quot; only served to remove the foam, leaving hair behind virtually intact.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Went on well, made shaving less of a chore.</li>

            <li> Unlike the other Dove Men facial products, the shave gel is &amp;#34;blend&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;average.&amp;#34; I fail to distinguish the uniqueness of the product from other brands.</li>
            <li> Just a little dab is all you need of this shaving cream to get it to cover all your face.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, you&#x27;ll cut yourself repeatedly, and scrape off layers of epidermis without cutting much hair.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have always liked Dove products, so was very happy when I saw they came out with a mens line to buy for my son.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This goes on really well and creates a nice foam, easy to shave with. It leaves his face moisturized and hydrated and not dry and peeling. It doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin and I find that he has less cuts than with the other products he&#x27;s used.  I have also used this product to shave my legs with and I really like it as well. Others have said they do not like the smell of it, but I don&#x27;t find that it has a bad smell to it at all. It&#x27;s just a normal non-perfumey or non-feminine scent to it. Nothing strong or offensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely think that is product is better than Gillette or Axe, which is what he was using prior to this and seems to be comparable in price to those.</li>
            <li> Unlike the other Dove Men facial products, the shave gel is &amp;#34;blend&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;average.&amp;#34; I fail to distinguish the uniqueness of the product from other brands. There is also something awkward and inconsistent about the dispenser and how the gel is dispensed.</li>
            <li> Again, a solid dove product.</li>
            <li> Dove Men&#x27;s Care Sensitive Shave Gel is great for sensitive skin. It provides a close shave without the burn. Left no feelings of irritation and left the skin feeling soft with no razor burn. The scent is light and not strong or overwhelming. Very gentle and not harsh, not sticky but foamy. Packaging was well done. No problems using this product in the shower.</li>
            <li> Terrible product.  While I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great for your skin, the gel oozes out like runny snot, and runs down the side of the can and makes a mess. If you manage to get any on your face, it&#x27;s pretty much the same story. It just runs off your face. Thumbs down.</li>
            <li> I had a rash after using it.</li>
            <li> Really love this shaving gel. Smells great and leathers up my face. With any other shaving cream I would get lot of cuts on face. After using this shaving gel with Schick Hydro 5 Blade Razor I get a good clean shaving. I also bought the Dove face lotion to go with this.</li>
            <li> Great gel.  I don&#x27;t usually use shaving gel from a bottle, opting for a shaving cream or soap, but when I have to, this is my go to.  It gives me a remarkably smooth shave compared to other gels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that you don&#x27;t really need to use a lot of water at all to make it lather well.  In fact, it doesn&#x27;t take too much water to make it &amp;#34;too watery&amp;#34; for me.</li>
            <li> I am not  a fan, foam never gets rich or thick, seems like the container is not pressurized enough so you wait for some of the substance to come out and wait and wait, once you apply the gel it to your face it simply doesn&#x27;t stay on it but runs down like water. It also has distinctive smell that is not appealing at all, very disappointing. I have to say it is probably worst shave cream I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> It was a experiment in which I approach a complete stranger of the opposite sex, and after a couple minutes of talking, invite them to feel my face. Surprise was the first reaction, and those who would comply would always say the same thing..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Wow, your skin is sooo soft!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know right.&lt;br /&gt;After shaving, My skin feels baby soft. That&#x27;s the first thing I love about the gel. the second thing is the smells.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is pleasant, vaguely aftershave-ish, without being too overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;And the Residue is minimal. I&#x27;ve have some aftershaves that were terribly messy and a real hassle too clean up. The dove gel is a quick and easy clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if every order comes with a bonus, but along with my shave gel, I received a small travel size bottle of dove men care \\&quot;aqua impact\\&quot; body and face wash. I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but judging from the results I got from the shave gel, I&#x27;m excited to see how this product delivers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note,&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t already exfoliate on a regular basis, the gel might promote some exfoliating activity. My suggestion is to use a moisturizer immediately after shaving for a week or so, or till your skin catches up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to recap:&lt;br /&gt;Baby soft skin&lt;br /&gt;Pleasant scent&lt;br /&gt;Quick and easy clean up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend you try it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a MESS. Container dispenses from two outlets and each with a different creme. This requires mixing in your hand or on your face and is just more work in the morning that I don&#x27;t like. Too expensive for what you get.&lt;br /&gt;However, it does give a smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m gone from this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased a can of the Sensitive variant of this Dove Men+Care shave gel, and I can&#x27;t say that it works better than any other canned goo on the shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few observations:&lt;br /&gt;- For shave gel, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s quite runny. The more \\&quot;hydrating\\&quot; shave gels/creams typically have a certain level of thickness that at least implies you&#x27;re getting a moisturizing/hydrating product.&lt;br /&gt;- Call me crazy, but when I see a product marked \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot; with a white label of some kind, I assume the product will be fragrance-free and possibly dye-free. Neither is the case here.&lt;br /&gt;- Lots of stubble left following a shave with a brand new, out-of-the-box Gillette Mach3 Power.&lt;br /&gt;- Kind of REALLY expensive for canned shave gel that doesn&#x27;t outperform others.</li>
            <li> I like shaving with Hydrate gel because everything else I&#x27;ve tried doesn&#x27;t feel good while shaving.</li>
            <li> Dove has upped the ante in the men&#x27;s skin care game.  This shaving gel feels as the label reads, very hydrating.  I am not a big fan of gel shaving cream but this formula lathers up with only a small amount leaving my face feeling great after shaving and without much residue.  This is a winner and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I tend to like shaving products that mostly stay in gel or lotion form, since they lead to the best outcomes.  Dove&#x27;s Neb care is in the middle of that spectrum.  It will keep your face from drying out in the winter months... and some of you know this, but others don&#x27;t....  dint use soap like its going out of style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion relieves razor burn and has a protective coating daily.  The lotion is opaque white and its a think comfy loincloth.</li>
            <li> It only takes a little but works really well.  Simply rub it in your hands then apply it as you normally would. Lather is good, but not so thick that you can&#x27;t see where you&#x27;re shaving like with many other shave gels &amp; creams. Also leaves skin feeling good, without drying.  Scent is manly but mild; its very much like the Ocean bodywash also made by Dove.  Good Product.</li>
            <li> Review by my husband, John: \\&quot;Previously I used Gillette&#x27;s sensitive skin gel, but I won&#x27;t any more. This is a really nice shaving gel that works quickly and well. The razor just glides over it, and it is very soothing if you shave a little closer than you intended. Like all Dove products it is gentle, with little odor, it is clean, easy to apply and remove. I am very happy with this product.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my husband. He usually uses electric shavers or clippers because he has extremely sensitive skin, and shaving manually will usually result in a rash or pain. Because he is now looking for a new job, he needed to get rid of the perma stubble that the electric shaver leaves behind. This product worked out great for him. He got a nice, close shave without any of the unpleasantness that comes with traditional shaving cream. We have also noticed that the hair doesn&#x27;t grow in as quickly when he uses this product, and it is softer when it does come in. It has a nice smell to it too...very manly and not feminine, which was important to my husband, as he was leery about using something that would make him smell &amp;#34;girly.&amp;#34; Even if you are a typical man&#x27;s man, who isn&#x27;t all that into grooming and beauty products, you should still give this a try if you have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I was curious so I tried some of it on my legs, and it was wonderful (other than the &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; smell). Just the right texture and amount of lather for a perfect shave with no bumps or nicks. They really need to make this exact product and market it towards women, with different packaging and scent!</li>
            <li> Its Shave Gel. It works. Its a little thinner lather than other shave gels but it gets the job done. I like the fragrance.</li>
            <li> My husband absolutely loves this shave gel.  He said it goes on smooth and helps his face not feel dry after shaving...and lasts all day. The scent is mild but manly.  Just a little dab is all you need of this shaving cream to get it to cover all your face.  This is his brand from now on.</li>
            <li> I tried this [[ASIN:B00A0J09C0 Dove Men+Care Hydrate + Shave Gel]] along with the [[ASIN:B00A0J09F2 Dove Men+Care Sensitive + Shave Gel]] and I find that I prefer THIS variety.  They are both good products for the price and do much the same thing.  I would recommend either one to someone looking to try out a new shave gel or somebody looking for a gel that will help them get a closer hsave without irritation.  Both have a mild scent that is much less noticeable than the Axe Shave Gels.  Both types saturate the beard well too, helping you get a closer shave on the first pass with the razor.  This is nice because the closer you can shave on the first pass, the less likely you are to nick yourself or \\&quot;burn\\&quot; your face with repeated swipes of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked this variety a little bit better because my face felt noticeably smoother afterwards.  Both were good at protecting my face and leaving it feeling shaved close but not tight or \\&quot;burned\\&quot;.  This Hydrating formula seemed to do it a little bit better and therefore this is the can I would reach for when I run out of Shave Gel.  I think the razor you use makes a difference as does whether or not you use a post shave balm so when I tried them side by side, I used the same razor, [[ASIN:B003987CL0 Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor, 1-count Package]] and I refrained from using any post-shave balm or moisturizer.  The Hyrdating Gel simply felt better.  I compared these every other day for two weeks before reaching that conclusion.  It could be the Sunflower Oil in the formulation that helps give you the extra smoothness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering that the Dove Shave Gel is priced competatively with brands I have used for years with lesser results, it makes sense to switch and never look back.  I like the Axe shave gels I have tried, such as the [[ASIN:B00A0J08H6 Axe Shave Gel, Chilled, 7 Ounce]] but the Axe shave gels all have a stronger, more noticeable scent.  Even though their scent dissipates over time, the Dove scent is barely there, leaving you free to wear whatever scents you choose to without having to work around the spiciness of the Axe gels.  I never thought of Dove as a men&#x27;s line before but I&#x27;ll look twice at their products in the future after the good results I got here.ove scent is barely there, leaving you free to wear whatever scents you choose to without having to work around the spiciness of the Axe gels.  I never thought of Dove as a men&#x27;s line before but I&#x27;ll look twice at their products in the future after the good results I got here.</li>
            <li> This is one of the smoothest and silkiest shave gel I have ever used. Went on well, made shaving less of a chore. And afterward, my face felt moisturized without me needing to go to the lotion as I usually have to. The scent is mild and barely noticeable but be warned, the button on top doesn&#x27;t need much of a touch to dispense and the gel really foams up, so you don&#x27;t need as much as you think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I have been impressed with all the Dove for Men products I have tried and definitely will be using them again.</li>
            <li> I got to say this product is amazing. This is my go to shaving gel for my guy. LOVE IT</li>
            <li> When I first used this shave gel, I made the mistake of pressing done on the nozzle too hard. This bottle dispenses quite a bit of shaving cream with just a small push. That said, it&#x27;s some of the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can really feel the hydration when you apply this shaving gel. Too many shaving creams are dry, but not this one. You only have to use a little bit of this in order to cover your whole face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked this shaving gel. It&#x27;s not very expensive and it works better than most shaving creams I&#x27;ve used. If you&#x27;ve had problems with your shaving creams, give this one a try.</li>
            <li> This new Dove Men+Care Sensitive Shave Gel is hands down the best shave gel I have ever used. It mostly comes down to personal budget and opinion when it comes to shaving products, but this new Dove Men+Care Sensitive Shave Gel is worth consideration if you&#x27;re looking for a nice shave gel that won&#x27;t murder your face. The smell is pleasant and relaxing, the gel turns into an incredibly rich cream-like lather, and boy does it soothe skin! I used to avoid shaving with manual razors at all cost because my skin gets irritated that easily, and I&#x27;ve used just about every kind of gel/cream imaginable including $6-$7 Gillette and Nivea products that are half of the size of this. So Dove is definitely doing something right to have earned a spot as a mainstay in my bathroom. The razor glide is very smooth and painful/irritating razor pull is non-existent, a feeling I haven&#x27;t experienced since before I started growing facial hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line; if you are seeking relief for your sensitive skin, or just want a superior quality shave from a budget friendly product I would highly recommend you take this Dove Men+Care Sensitive shave gel into consideration. As far as being cost-effective, you won&#x27;t find a better product! Very comfortable shave, won&#x27;t dry skin, eliminates razor burn, smells great, rinses clean and won&#x27;t kill the wallet. Final opinion will always come down to personal taste, but if you&#x27;re looking for the best bang for your buck, look absolutely no further!</li>
            <li> Sooooo much better than the Nivea for Men shave gel I had before this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shave gel, and it works well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shave cream, what can you really say. It smells nice and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00A0J09C0 Dove Men+ Care Hydrate + Shave Gel]] solved a problem for me that shaving used to cause.  While shaving, I would be these small rash type patches just at the base of my neck from irritation after shaving.  They would generally dissipate and go away the next day or so but they were somewhat embarrassing in public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am personally a big fan or Dove products and I really like this shave gel because it worked for my problem.  In my experience, Dove Men+ products are gentler on my skin than some of the other brands.  This shave gel is very gentle on the skin and has a nice smell.  It goes on smooth and clings pretty well for use. I don&#x27;t have much issue with hydration nor was that something specific I was wanting from this product so I can&#x27;t comment on that.  Overall, I really like this shave gel from Dove and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with the men+care shave gel.  It&#x27;s not quite as foamy as a traditional shaving cream such as barbasol, but rather a silky, creamy consistency which was refreshing.  I felt like the razor glided very easily through without any discomfort despite the lesser &amp;#34;volume&amp;#34; of traditional shaving creams, and unlike some other gels, it doesn&#x27;t get very sticky on your face.  The smell is fresh and clean but not overpowering.  I usually use lotion after I shave because my face gets a bit sensitive, but it felt like I didn&#x27;t need it as my face felt lubricated even after I washed up.  Another thing I liked is the unique pump on the top, which seems to prevent that slow, annoying leakage of additional foam after you&#x27;re done dispensing, which is a great touch because I always found that so annoying.  Overall this product resembles the quality of a product like Beard Lube by Jack Black, but at a fraction of the cost, it&#x27;s definitely the best bang for the buck in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been walking through the desert of inadequate skin care for years and have just discovered an oasis. To say that my skin is sensitive is an understatement. I&#x27;ve tried many, many shaving products but none have worked. Then I found Dove when I least expected it. I knew their soap could hydrate the heck out of my skin but for reasons I can&#x27;t remember I was skeptical about their shaving gel. Perhaps is was because I&#x27;d been burned by so many inferior products in the past.&lt;br /&gt;First the gel comes out in just the right amount. Some dispensers have a hair trigger that leaves you with a handful of product when all you needed was a dollop. Not this bottle. The engineering/design team deserves a raise. Not only does it deliver the perfect amount every time, but it doesn&#x27;t leave any residual gel on the dispenser to clog it up. Also it smells nice. You&#x27;d think something that worked this well at protecting your skin to have a medical smell. Nope. This stuff smells right. It&#x27;s the appropriate amount of masculine, but not overwhelming. And have I mentioned that it works.. No more irritation for me. My face is smooth. My skin is hydrated. Do yourself a favor and give this a try.</li>
            <li> Unexpectedly slow outflow like&lt;br /&gt;Any low quality product.&lt;br /&gt;Quality of lather is OK for price paid</li>
            <li> Hubby said this Dove Shave Gel is awesome.  It lathers alot and has a nice fragrance while giving him a nice clean shave and leaving his face feeling soft and not dry.  I don&#x27;t know about the rest of you ladies but I also tend to use the mens shave gel when I run out of mine and have tried this to find I really like it also.  They should just call this His &amp; Hers Shave Gel by Dove.  The price is reasonable and comparable to others and the Dove name is one that I always get good quality with.</li>
            <li> I found this to be better than the quality of the shave gel that I usually get. It has a great fragrance and pretty much what you expect out of Dove.</li>
            <li> Not the best shave gel but does the trick. Seems a little bit watered down, really thin. Gillette seems to be better for me.</li>
            <li> REVIEW: DOVE Men +Care Shave Gel Hydrate+&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I certainly do not enjoy shaving every morning but since I have no desire to sport a beard or moustache there seems to be no alternative.  Like many other men I cannot get a satisfactory shave using an electric razor so I have no option but to use the traditional method.  I recently tried DOVE&#x27;s MEN +CARE Hydrate+ shaving gel and found it to be very good for lubricating the skin so the razor can glide smoothly and do its&#x27; job more efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the essential lubricating quality it did not irritate my skin and the remainder washed off cleanly.  The scent was reasonably subdued and did not linger after the final rinse.  I found the lubricating quality of the gel to be higher than the normal soap foam variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rate this product 9.5 on a scale of 10.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. It&#x27;s not overly scented, so I&#x27;ve found myself &#x27;borrowing it&#x27; in the shower. Great stuff and smells great.</li>
            <li> Tried this instead of my usual gilette and that was a mistake. This stuff broke my face out and caused me to rash.</li>
            <li> As someone who has always suffered with dry sensitive skin.  I am so glad I finally found Dove Men+Care Hydrate + Shave Gel.  I am able to get the smooth super close shave I need.  While at the same time leaving my skin feeling hydrated and free from irritation.  I recommend this shave gel to anyone, especially if you have have sensitive skin and crave that close shave.</li>
            <li> The men in our lives deserve great skin too! Got this for my husband and it&#x27;s so much cheaper than going to like Sephora or somewhere and splurging on crazy expensive shave cream or gel. This does just as well, and it&#x27;s way less in price - great buy!</li>
            <li> The Dove brand carries with it the trust that you are about to use a product that won&#x27;t disappoint. Known for products that are kind to our skin, this shaving gel follows the rest of the product family under the toughest conditions - a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a small amount of product foams to create enough to cover your face, and is a perfect match for any razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a close shave that leaves your face feeling smooth, this product gives amazing per use value from the generous size can.</li>
            <li> At my age, I&#x27;m finally learning to shave with a straight razor. A co-worker talked up the value of a single-edge straight razor to maintain a crisp, professional-looking edge on my facial hair, especially for men like me with wiry beard hair and copious neck beard. Turns out, having a beard is more work, not less. Also, turns out, shaving with a straight razor isn&#x27;t essentially similar to shaving with a disposable safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dad shoved a Schick razor in my hand when I was 14, and said \\&quot;go for it.\\&quot; You can&#x27;t do that with a straight razor. The narrow edge and tetchy qualities make for a more intensive process. If you really want to shave with a straight razor, may I suggest starting with the book [[ASIN:1475109849 The Art of Shaving: Shaving Made Easy - What the man who shaves ought to know.]]. First published in 1905, it offers step-by-step instructions in actually shaving without nicking yourself like a pincushion. Though it&#x27;s written in a dated style, and could do with more illustrations, it makes a good primer for shaving techniques your daddy never taught you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, you&#x27;ll need to pick a razor. Disposable safety razors are all more or less the same, and all equally annoying; you can get a good shave, but at the cost of tender, abraded skin. Straight razors are more unique. The book above makes good suggestions for choosing a razor, but I&#x27;ve found satisfaction with [[ASIN:B002ONHBBW Parker&#x27;s Stainless Steel Straight Razor]]. The advantage here, besides light weight and easy grip, is the changeable single-edge blade. Since it doesn&#x27;t need stropping, it&#x27;s low maintenance, and you can graduate to authentic blue steel later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first lesson with the straight razor: don&#x27;t overlook your foam. I got in the habit of dry-shaving several years ago, but especially if you have thick, wiry facial hair like me, you absolutely need a foam. Otherwise, you&#x27;ll cut yourself repeatedly, and scrape off layers of epidermis without cutting much hair. Safety razor foam won&#x27;t work, not well anyway. I tried using [[ASIN:B00A0J09C0 Dove Men+Care Shave Gel]], as I&#x27;m a fan of Dove Men+Care overall; but this was a real disappointment. It was thick, heavy, and didn&#x27;t lather up much; \\&quot;shaving\\&quot; only served to remove the foam, leaving hair behind virtually intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good-quality stuff is pricy, but I&#x27;ve found it worthwhile. I sprung for [[ASIN:B00A6UKMM0 The Art of Shaving Kit]], which includes a pre-shave oil, thick shaving cream, a badger hair brush, and aftershave. Having all four is something of an indulgence, but especially if you want to look professional and trustworthy--or if you want to have your sweetheart touch your face plenty--the indulgence is worth it. Also, the multi-stage shaving regimen is a real sensual pleasure, in a way safety rasor shaving just isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One warning: the kit mentioned above doesn&#x27;t include a cup for your shaving cream. If you brish the cream directly onto your skin, it won&#x27;t foam up, and it&#x27;ll actually make shaving more difficult, not less. I got the [[ASIN:B00HV6L3DE Evalley Men&#x27;s Stainless Steel Shaving Cup]], which, being metal, retains the heat of your hot-water shave quite nicely, and helps me work up a rich lather that&#x27;s both easy to use, and a pleasure to apply. Several people have complained that the cup is too small, but I say: too small for what? If your brush fits in, and it holds all your foam, then it&#x27;s done what you bought it to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, this isn&#x27;t a complete instruction on straight-razor shaving. That&#x27;s what the book is for. I only intend to recommend which products have worked for me. I&#x27;m still re-learning the science of shaving. However, what I&#x27;ve written here should constitute a good learning kit, as I&#x27;ve found it all, working together, conspires to give me a shave that&#x27;s a pleasure while it&#x27;s in process, and leaves my skin baby smooth afterward. Shaving hasn&#x27;t been this slow-going since I first tried it as a kid; but it hasn&#x27;r. Safety razor foam won&#x27;t work, not well anyway. I tried using [[ASIN:B00A0J09C0 Dove Men+Care Shave Gel]], as I&#x27;m a fan of Dove Men+Care overall; but this was a real disappointment.

Shaving hasn&#x27;t been this slow-going since I first tried it as a kid; but it hasn&#x27;t been this pleasurable EVER. At my age, for the first time, I enjoy shaving. And now, you can too.</li>
            <li> This shave gel is different from store brands. I like how it doesn&#x27;t need a lot of foam to be effective and it leaves my skin feeling moisturized and smooth . As for the shaving experience, I don&#x27;t believe there is anything noticeably different other than the fact that it provides a close shave. The smell is barely noticeable. The only downside is that after you use the gel there is an excess amount that comes out. Overall, it&#x27;s a good product with only a minor downside.</li>
            <li> This will be a great product. I have been buying dove products all my life.Dove smells really good and is very affordable for people who don&#x27;t want to spend the extra money.This would make a very nice gift for my husband.</li>
            <li> Much more impressed by Dove Men&#x27;s shave gel than their \\&quot;Hydrate\\&quot; face wash.  Most shave gels are a notch above old school shaving cream (which still works in a pinch).  While I don&#x27;t like this quite as much as I like Axe shaving gel, this is still quite a good shaving gel.</li>
            <li> This is a great shave gel/foam. It is thick, rich, and does not dry out in the middle of a shave. It even smells nice. I&#x27;ve use Neutrogena for awhile which is pretty good but the Dove gel far surpasses it. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The Dove Men+Care shaving cream is a great for those who have sensitive skin. After using this my skin was the softest it has ever been after shaving. Usually my skin feels irritated after I shave but with the Dove shaving cream it felt soft and refreshed. And comnined with the Dove Men after shave balm, my skin felt and looked great. I highly recommend this product and others like it in the Dove Men+Care skin line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several products for men, looking for the best thing to use to shave with. So far I really like this and the cent. It&#x27;s really easy on my face and to shave with. I like that it foams and the product looks good on my counter.</li>
