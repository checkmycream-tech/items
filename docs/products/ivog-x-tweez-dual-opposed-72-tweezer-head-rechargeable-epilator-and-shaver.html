            <li>I have been looking for something like this for quite a while and am thrilled that I found it!</li>
            <li>it arrived, it looked awesome: shaving unit, epilator, and more for just $40?</li>
            <li>It holds the charge good.</li>
            <li>I was looking to find a good epilator at an affordable cost.  </li>
            <li>After reading the reviews the ivog seemed like a good choice, even though I had never heard of this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>to the wise.</li>
            <li>Reviews were so good for this unit.</li>
            <li>It worked good in the beginning but broke after just two weeks of use.</li>
            <li>First of all, I must say Ivog customer service is awesome.</li>
            <li>I also recommend Exfoliating your skin first for best results.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>: this products is great and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>amazing, and</li>
            <li>power that the cordless has is amazing</li>
            <li>life is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>and I do not have the guts to effectively pull a wax strip.</li>
            <li>Good product I should of bought one that was water proof, I would be able to use for more purposes, brut this one is doing what it&#x27;s supposed to be doing.</li>
            <li>an epilator, it is extremely good, and produces excellent results, although not all functions have been tested to date, such as the hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>so far great product!!</li>
            <li>Great first experience.</li>
            <li>The design was nice because it fits comfortably in my hands, which makes it very easily to maneuver.</li>
            <li>I thought I would be able to replace the product  by ivog, but they didn&#x27;t give that as an option.</li>
            <li>Another four weeks to get a quality product from a better company, I hope.</li>
            <li>I am extremely satisfied with product.</li>
            <li>I mostly use epilator.</li>
            <li>Compared to my braun, it takes me 1/5 of the time and has 1/10th of the pain and does a much better job on most areas.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>There were so many to choose from</li>
            <li>and I was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I thought with 72 tweezers it would have been a better unit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so satisfied with the performance of this product.</li>
            <li>NOW THAT I HAVE HAD FOR MANY YEARS AND LOVE IT</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m completely in love with it.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>It DID come charged so I was able to try to for a bit.</li>
            <li>I used it on my chin and don&#x27;t have too many hairs</li>
            <li>It works okay, but after 3 uses, one side broke.  </li>
            <li>Opposed 72 Tweezer Head Epilator is quite simply the best epilator I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It does not work better.</li>
            <li>While researching, I bought this one based on the reviews, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>it was doing a pretty good job at removing the hair.  </li>
            <li>This was not how I hoped it would be, when I got it I was so excited!</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s rechargeable and light weight.</li>
            <li>If you want a good, fast, reliable epilator, go with Emjoi.</li>
            <li>The unit itself is well designed with the 72 head, and fits easily in the hand,&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>great, this one grasped the fine hair much better than the emjoi and only required 2 passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bikini</li>
            <li>The tweezers are great and don&#x27;t really break any hairs if you use the right setting for the area</li>
            <li>I have tried some different brand and I have found the best one, thanks!</li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s supposed to feel like when you have 72 tweezers working quickly to pull out all the hair!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, has plenty of power in its two power settings, and the 72 tweezer heads significantly reduce the amount of time epilating takes.</li>
            <li>It works great, can&#x27;t be plugged in and used at the same time.</li>
            <li>a fabulous job-</li>
            <li>My jaw line is every bit as smooth as when my hairdresser finishes a wax treatment at the salon.</li>
            <li>Well, this epilator has done such a great job...</li>
            <li>Cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>The light came on like</li>
            <li>but I could not believe how smooth my skin was after.</li>
            <li>first time I used this epilator on my legs, I wasn&#x27;t sure I was using it correctly because it didn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>Ok... I have to say it hurts a LOT the first time.</li>
            <li>WORTH IT!</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t know how to clean them out.</li>
            <li>even when i got a small thread from my shirt caught in it, the epilator didn&#x27;t break which I was super impressed with.</li>
            <li>It worked just as expected and I am happy I got this.</li>
            <li>Also, I was able to make it through the whole area in one sitting.</li>
            <li>* misunderstood the product description that says, \\&quot;iVog X-Tweez can be used wirelessly after charging it for about 6 hrs, it can work for 30-40 minutes after a full charge.</li>
            <li>The ivog xtweex is well priced than many of the other epilators on the market, but the superior performance makes it well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a long time user of epilators and was lured by the 72 tweezer head (which was pretty great as far as speed and comfort for the kind of device it is)</li>
            <li>This conked off so quickly.</li>
            <li>and I can maintain myself fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Secondly, this is my very first epilator.</li>
            <li>My legs do not always come smooth, but since this is my first epilator I think this could be my inexperience.</li>
            <li>The iVog has a very fast rotation and a large number of tweezers, which pulls the hair out faster, thus reducing the pain and making it more efficient.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t owned for very long and have only used this Epilator twice but was very happy with how it worked.....</li>
            <li>But overall most of my upper lip hairs are gone which is a good thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My old one works so much better, so</li>
            <li>I think of this as my own personal torture device.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do much better on my legs than my 10 year old epilator, but since it was supposed to work both on battery AND plugged in, I figured it was somewhat of an upgrade.</li>
            <li>In the spots that I had used it the day before, it actually felt good, but I do have a decent pain tolerance.</li>
            <li>the package arrived the epilator seemed to be charged, so I used it right away.  </li>
            <li>I gave it a couple of days, because I didn&#x27;t want to irritate my legs right away.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised the product arrived quickly and was charged so my wife was able to use it immediately straight out of the package.</li>
            <li>I could barely feel it pulling out the hairs, even though it was doing so much more efficiently than the braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks iVog!</li>
            <li>I have owned many different brands and if his review is favorable then I will buy one for myself.</li>
            <li>First I thought it makes no difference, but it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i thought i would try this one first.</li>
            <li>am returning this product because you can&#x27;t use it with the cord, and It doesn&#x27;t charge up enough to be able to use it.  </li>
            <li>area did hurt the first time I did it; but it was tolerable...</li>
            <li>This was my first time using an epilator</li>
            <li>My face is so soft &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>Expect a lot of skin irritation the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And, it worked subpar for the first week.</li>
            <li>This was my first epilator.</li>
            <li>and my legs are still so much smoother than shaving!</li>
            <li>After that, it is really like doing touchups and doesn&#x27;t hurt at all!  </li>
            <li>When I first tried it out on my legs</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like it right now</li>
            <li>All in all, a very positive step forward, and highly recommended.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a 1/10 compared to my much cheaper first epilator that lasted 8 years.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Well, although it was nice to have the cordless feature, its absolutely not worth it.</li>
            <li>So far not bad.</li>
            <li>just be sure that your skin is 100% dry before you begin or it will really hurt and won&#x27;t be very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;fine hair on arms and stomach:&lt;br /&gt;Worked</li>
            <li>I have a pretty high tolerance for pain</li>
            <li>My underarms have become so much lighter now</li>
            <li>This worked really well for my arms and some hairs on my stomach as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really pick up the hairs from the roots but instead just broke them or didn&#x27;t get picked up at all.  </li>
            <li>But it really gets the job done.</li>
            <li>iVog fits very well into my lifestyle, and I have saved its cost already in waxings at the salon.</li>
            <li>Take your time and do as much as you can.</li>
            <li>And when you plug it in, it will not go as fast.</li>
            <li>HAIRS ARE MUCH SOFTER THEN.</li>
            <li>This epilator did a fantastic job and equals one that I have that sold at double the price.  </li>
            <li>I took the whole thing apart, cleaned it out, tried to figure it out.</li>
            <li>So, my roommate uses &amp;#34;Soft Caress&amp;#34; by emjoi, and I really wanted to buy an epilator after hearing her rave about it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I wore jeans instead of shorts, and I charged it the whole night.</li>
            <li>I returned mine and bought a Panasonic ES-ED90-P which I&#x27;m really looking forward to owning instead.</li>
            <li>WAY TOO MUCH MONEY.</li>
            <li>But as I used it, it wasn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;pulling&amp;#34; the hairs as it said.</li>
            <li>It does the job very well on her face and legs.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>then I had to quit because the pain became too much to handle</li>
            <li>So In the beginning i loved epilating it kept the hair off for at least 8 days</li>
            <li>I would have loved to exchange it for a replacement to give it another shot, but Amazon would only refund my purchase and said I could purchase it again, however since I originally got it for 25% off I wasn&#x27;t going to pay full price for something that had already failed to perform well.</li>
            <li>JUST REMEMBER THAT IT WORKS BETTER AFTER A HOT SHOWER AND FULLY DRIED OFF.</li>
            <li>It was a total waste of my money and anguish I had, using it.&lt;br /&gt;I have used other products and have them working for 7/9 years, still in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>Even with it pulling it pulled more hairs at a time, the speed made it hurt less than the braun I had been using.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I know that it&#x27;s going to hurt less after the first time</li>
            <li>I used it maybe twice and was highly dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this seller to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Were my expectations too high?</li>
            <li>It will hurt the first time, but not as much the second time.&lt;br /&gt;-Think about purchasing a lotion that has a hair growth inhibitor in it.</li>
            <li>The price of getting an upper body wax for a man on a consistent basis is too much.</li>
            <li>you know anything about epilating, 5 minutes barely gets you pass your first leg.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, its cordless, which is a huge plus compared to the other one she had, so she can now use the epilator where ever it is convenient for her, not bound by where the plugs are.</li>
            <li>Well, it should be pretty obvious because it&#x27;s ripping out your hair at a high speed...</li>
            <li>It took several passes, but my skin was left smooth.</li>
            <li>so of course the hair will grow back consistently.  </li>
            <li>DID try this on my face, and it does remove the small amounts of hair on my upperlip, but it does hurt a lot more than the rest of my body.  </li>
            <li>So, I used it for three days to get the first initial procedure done.  </li>
            <li>I have an old braun silk, that is probably 5 years old.  </li>
            <li>There was an issue with my package, I sincerely believe my local post office misplaced my package.</li>
            <li>My leg hair is course and thick and the follicles are more... dispersed than they would be under my arms.  </li>
            <li>I loved this epilator for about three and a half weeks, as it was less painful and more effective than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-You will NOT get every single hair the first time.</li>
            <li>WITH MY OLDER ONES, JUST ON MY LEGS BOTH LOWER AND UPPER.</li>
            <li>I notified Ivog customer service, their response was prompt and a new package was shipped to me via UPS 2nd day air.</li>
            <li>Even though this epilator cost a little more than some of the other ones listed on Amazon here, I bought it thinking that since it was a 72 head tweezer it would work better/more efficient.</li>
            <li>I used this product a total of 3 times and it seemed to be working good meaning removing hair , it was somewhat painful the first couple times.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 53, and I finally have soft, hair-free legs and underarms!  </li>
            <li>Well I was a little scared at first because i&#x27;ve never owned an epilator before, but so far this product has done wonders, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin</li>
            <li>The choice was clear, I can pay 50-100$ a month for a wax, spend a half hour a day shaving to maintain a constant chest stubble, or endure a little pain for a half hour a week and look good.</li>
            <li>Opposed 72 Tweezer Head Epilator&amp;#34; but the price bumped up $25 since the last time I purchased it, so when my current Emjoi&#x27;s tweezer head was worn out I decided to buy a new Epilator.</li>
            <li>This has been a great and less expensive alternative to waxing for me.</li>
            <li>However, some times I don&#x27;t have enough time, so I have an option to use a shaver.&lt;br /&gt;The head of the epilator is wide, so the process goes fast.</li>
            <li>WAY TOO MUCH MONEY, DOES NOT PERFORM AS I EXPECTED, SENT IT BACK.</li>
            <li>Okay so I bought this back in December 2013 because I&#x27;m tired of shaving my hooha</li>
            <li>It barely tweezes my under arms, I have to run the head over my legs several times to tweeze all the hairs and it still misses spots.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the device itself is a lot bigger than the emjoi with half as many tweezers and as such I found it more painful than the emjoi ap18</li>
            <li>Right now I am not sure if I would ever buy another iVog.</li>
            <li>It loses power in 30-40 minutes, barely enough time to get both full legs, bikini, and underarms done.</li>
            <li>During my first use on my underarms, it felt like little shocks!</li>
            <li>Large, to heavy, did not take hair off.  </li>
            <li>I suppose I&#x27;ll have to wait until the other stops and order a new one.</li>

            <li> an epilator, it is extremely good, and produces excellent results, although not all functions have been tested to date, such as the hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> so far great product!!</li>
            <li> Great first experience.</li>
            <li> The design was nice because it fits comfortably in my hands, which makes it very easily to maneuver.</li>
            <li> I thought I would be able to replace the product  by ivog, but they didn&#x27;t give that as an option.</li>
            <li> Another four weeks to get a quality product from a better company, I hope.</li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfied with product.</li>
            <li> I mostly use epilator.</li>
            <li> Compared to my braun, it takes me 1/5 of the time and has 1/10th of the pain and does a much better job on most areas.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There were so many to choose from</li>
            <li> and I was pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I thought with 72 tweezers it would have been a better unit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so satisfied with the performance of this product.</li>
            <li> NOW THAT I HAVE HAD FOR MANY YEARS AND LOVE IT</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m completely in love with it.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> It DID come charged so I was able to try to for a bit.</li>
            <li> I used it on my chin and don&#x27;t have too many hairs</li>
            <li> It works okay, but after 3 uses, one side broke.  </li>
            <li> Opposed 72 Tweezer Head Epilator is quite simply the best epilator I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It does not work better.</li>
            <li> While researching, I bought this one based on the reviews, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> it was doing a pretty good job at removing the hair.  </li>
            <li> This was not how I hoped it would be, when I got it I was so excited!</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s rechargeable and light weight.</li>
            <li> If you want a good, fast, reliable epilator, go with Emjoi.</li>
            <li> The unit itself is well designed with the 72 head, and fits easily in the hand,&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> great, this one grasped the fine hair much better than the emjoi and only required 2 passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bikini</li>
            <li> The tweezers are great and don&#x27;t really break any hairs if you use the right setting for the area</li>
            <li> I have tried some different brand and I have found the best one, thanks!</li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s supposed to feel like when you have 72 tweezers working quickly to pull out all the hair!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, has plenty of power in its two power settings, and the 72 tweezer heads significantly reduce the amount of time epilating takes.</li>
            <li> It works great, can&#x27;t be plugged in and used at the same time.</li>
            <li> a fabulous job-</li>
            <li> My jaw line is every bit as smooth as when my hairdresser finishes a wax treatment at the salon.</li>
            <li> Well, this epilator has done such a great job...</li>
            <li> Cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> The light came on like</li>
            <li> but I could not believe how smooth my skin was after.</li>
            <li> first time I used this epilator on my legs, I wasn&#x27;t sure I was using it correctly because it didn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> Ok... I have to say it hurts a LOT the first time.</li>
            <li> WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know how to clean them out.</li>
            <li> even when i got a small thread from my shirt caught in it, the epilator didn&#x27;t break which I was super impressed with.</li>
            <li> It worked just as expected and I am happy I got this.</li>
            <li> Also, I was able to make it through the whole area in one sitting.</li>
            <li> * misunderstood the product description that says, \\&quot;iVog X-Tweez can be used wirelessly after charging it for about 6 hrs, it can work for 30-40 minutes after a full charge.</li>
            <li> The ivog xtweex is well priced than many of the other epilators on the market, but the superior performance makes it well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time user of epilators and was lured by the 72 tweezer head (which was pretty great as far as speed and comfort for the kind of device it is)</li>
            <li> This conked off so quickly.</li>
            <li> and I can maintain myself fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, this is my very first epilator.</li>
            <li> My legs do not always come smooth, but since this is my first epilator I think this could be my inexperience.</li>
            <li> The iVog has a very fast rotation and a large number of tweezers, which pulls the hair out faster, thus reducing the pain and making it more efficient.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t owned for very long and have only used this Epilator twice but was very happy with how it worked.....</li>
            <li> But overall most of my upper lip hairs are gone which is a good thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My old one works so much better, so</li>
            <li> I think of this as my own personal torture device.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do much better on my legs than my 10 year old epilator, but since it was supposed to work both on battery AND plugged in, I figured it was somewhat of an upgrade.</li>
            <li> In the spots that I had used it the day before, it actually felt good, but I do have a decent pain tolerance.</li>
            <li> the package arrived the epilator seemed to be charged, so I used it right away.  </li>
            <li> I gave it a couple of days, because I didn&#x27;t want to irritate my legs right away.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised the product arrived quickly and was charged so my wife was able to use it immediately straight out of the package.</li>
            <li> I could barely feel it pulling out the hairs, even though it was doing so much more efficiently than the braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks iVog!</li>
            <li> I have owned many different brands and if his review is favorable then I will buy one for myself.</li>
            <li> First I thought it makes no difference, but it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i thought i would try this one first.</li>
            <li> am returning this product because you can&#x27;t use it with the cord, and It doesn&#x27;t charge up enough to be able to use it.  </li>
            <li> area did hurt the first time I did it; but it was tolerable...</li>
            <li> This was my first time using an epilator</li>
            <li> My face is so soft &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> Expect a lot of skin irritation the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And, it worked subpar for the first week.</li>
            <li> This was my first epilator.</li>
            <li> and my legs are still so much smoother than shaving!</li>
            <li> After that, it is really like doing touchups and doesn&#x27;t hurt at all!  </li>
            <li> When I first tried it out on my legs</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like it right now</li>
            <li> All in all, a very positive step forward, and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a 1/10 compared to my much cheaper first epilator that lasted 8 years.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Well, although it was nice to have the cordless feature, its absolutely not worth it.</li>
            <li> So far not bad.</li>
            <li> just be sure that your skin is 100% dry before you begin or it will really hurt and won&#x27;t be very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;fine hair on arms and stomach:&lt;br /&gt;Worked</li>
            <li> I have a pretty high tolerance for pain</li>
            <li> My underarms have become so much lighter now</li>
            <li> This worked really well for my arms and some hairs on my stomach as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really pick up the hairs from the roots but instead just broke them or didn&#x27;t get picked up at all.  </li>
            <li> But it really gets the job done.</li>
            <li> iVog fits very well into my lifestyle, and I have saved its cost already in waxings at the salon.</li>
            <li> Take your time and do as much as you can.</li>
            <li> And when you plug it in, it will not go as fast.</li>
            <li> HAIRS ARE MUCH SOFTER THEN.</li>
            <li> This epilator did a fantastic job and equals one that I have that sold at double the price.  </li>
            <li> I took the whole thing apart, cleaned it out, tried to figure it out.</li>
            <li> So, my roommate uses &amp;#34;Soft Caress&amp;#34; by emjoi, and I really wanted to buy an epilator after hearing her rave about it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I wore jeans instead of shorts, and I charged it the whole night.</li>
            <li> I returned mine and bought a Panasonic ES-ED90-P which I&#x27;m really looking forward to owning instead.</li>
            <li> WAY TOO MUCH MONEY.</li>
            <li> But as I used it, it wasn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;pulling&amp;#34; the hairs as it said.</li>
            <li> It does the job very well on her face and legs.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> then I had to quit because the pain became too much to handle</li>
            <li> So In the beginning i loved epilating it kept the hair off for at least 8 days</li>
            <li> I would have loved to exchange it for a replacement to give it another shot, but Amazon would only refund my purchase and said I could purchase it again, however since I originally got it for 25% off I wasn&#x27;t going to pay full price for something that had already failed to perform well.</li>
            <li> JUST REMEMBER THAT IT WORKS BETTER AFTER A HOT SHOWER AND FULLY DRIED OFF.</li>
            <li> It was a total waste of my money and anguish I had, using it.&lt;br /&gt;I have used other products and have them working for 7/9 years, still in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Even with it pulling it pulled more hairs at a time, the speed made it hurt less than the braun I had been using.</li>
            <li> Fortunately I know that it&#x27;s going to hurt less after the first time</li>
            <li> I used it maybe twice and was highly dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this seller to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Were my expectations too high?</li>
            <li> It will hurt the first time, but not as much the second time.&lt;br /&gt;-Think about purchasing a lotion that has a hair growth inhibitor in it.</li>
            <li> The price of getting an upper body wax for a man on a consistent basis is too much.</li>
            <li> you know anything about epilating, 5 minutes barely gets you pass your first leg.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, its cordless, which is a huge plus compared to the other one she had, so she can now use the epilator where ever it is convenient for her, not bound by where the plugs are.</li>
            <li> Well, it should be pretty obvious because it&#x27;s ripping out your hair at a high speed...</li>
            <li> It took several passes, but my skin was left smooth.</li>
            <li> so of course the hair will grow back consistently.  </li>
            <li> DID try this on my face, and it does remove the small amounts of hair on my upperlip, but it does hurt a lot more than the rest of my body.  </li>
            <li> So, I used it for three days to get the first initial procedure done.  </li>
            <li> I have an old braun silk, that is probably 5 years old.  </li>
            <li> There was an issue with my package, I sincerely believe my local post office misplaced my package.</li>
            <li> My leg hair is course and thick and the follicles are more... dispersed than they would be under my arms.  </li>
            <li> I loved this epilator for about three and a half weeks, as it was less painful and more effective than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-You will NOT get every single hair the first time.</li>
            <li> WITH MY OLDER ONES, JUST ON MY LEGS BOTH LOWER AND UPPER.</li>
            <li> I notified Ivog customer service, their response was prompt and a new package was shipped to me via UPS 2nd day air.</li>
            <li> Even though this epilator cost a little more than some of the other ones listed on Amazon here, I bought it thinking that since it was a 72 head tweezer it would work better/more efficient.</li>
            <li> I used this product a total of 3 times and it seemed to be working good meaning removing hair , it was somewhat painful the first couple times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 53, and I finally have soft, hair-free legs and underarms!  </li>
            <li> Well I was a little scared at first because i&#x27;ve never owned an epilator before, but so far this product has done wonders, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin</li>
            <li> The choice was clear, I can pay 50-100$ a month for a wax, spend a half hour a day shaving to maintain a constant chest stubble, or endure a little pain for a half hour a week and look good.</li>
            <li> Opposed 72 Tweezer Head Epilator&amp;#34; but the price bumped up $25 since the last time I purchased it, so when my current Emjoi&#x27;s tweezer head was worn out I decided to buy a new Epilator.</li>
            <li> This has been a great and less expensive alternative to waxing for me.</li>
            <li> However, some times I don&#x27;t have enough time, so I have an option to use a shaver.&lt;br /&gt;The head of the epilator is wide, so the process goes fast.</li>
            <li> WAY TOO MUCH MONEY, DOES NOT PERFORM AS I EXPECTED, SENT IT BACK.</li>
            <li> Okay so I bought this back in December 2013 because I&#x27;m tired of shaving my hooha</li>
            <li> It barely tweezes my under arms, I have to run the head over my legs several times to tweeze all the hairs and it still misses spots.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the device itself is a lot bigger than the emjoi with half as many tweezers and as such I found it more painful than the emjoi ap18</li>
            <li> Right now I am not sure if I would ever buy another iVog.</li>
            <li> It loses power in 30-40 minutes, barely enough time to get both full legs, bikini, and underarms done.</li>
            <li> During my first use on my underarms, it felt like little shocks!</li>
            <li> Large, to heavy, did not take hair off.  </li>
            <li> I suppose I&#x27;ll have to wait until the other stops and order a new one.</li>
            <li> and it does not even last long enough to tweeze one leg.</li>
            <li> My underarm hair is really thick and dark compared with my light complexion, and shaving just made the stubble reappear within 24 hours.  </li>
            <li> Instead it was more like cutting them quite a disappointment to be honest.</li>
            <li> I thought I had charged it long enough, but maybe I hadn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> but it says to try it in the bath, maybe I am not soaking long enough.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The battery does last long.</li>
            <li> but I find that after 6 months the battery doesn&#x27;t last as long as it used to.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I ever used an epilator and it was a little scarey at first</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t stay on for long before I have to charge it again.</li>
            <li> If it shows low battery capacity, you can insert the AC plug into the product to work.\\&quot; Not much to misunderstand there...</li>
            <li> Other epilators could take me an hour to do my legs, since I would have to go over the same area repeatedly to get all of the hairs.</li>
            <li> My next session though I was able to finish in one sitting as it wasn&#x27;t really painful.</li>
            <li> which is the same terminology emjoi uses for their epilator - but at half the price.</li>
            <li> hate shaving but love that just shaved feeling!  </li>
            <li> I read an abundant number of reviews on other epilators that were very expensive, but customers were not very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Company emails you to buy back the product if you say you will not leave negative feedback to avoid giving unsuspecting future customers the correct impression of their product - That it does not work!  </li>
            <li> (FYI- I am not a very hairy person, I have to tweeze every few weeks only).</li>
            <li> You can not use it when your skin is wet, you can not use it without the charger, it is a bit bulky when holding compare to other products.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get any bumps when I tried this on the other parts of my body.&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL</li>
            <li> But I read other reviews and decided to stick with it.</li>
            <li> NO PAPERWORK, NO INVOICE, NO PROOF OF PURCHASE OTHER THEN THROUGH AMAZON</li>
            <li> BUT the charging part was annoying and didn&#x27;t work well while plugged in, the actual equipment felt cheap and not well made (as opposed to a Braun or a legit Epilady).</li>
            <li> The next day my legs weren&#x27;t broken out like the usually get with my old braun.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the Pain.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I have to say is......</li>
            <li> So, two months ago (December 2013), I ordered iVog&#x27;s X-Tweez epilator, which at that time had an average of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t used to epilating, any epilator will be painful for the first several uses.</li>
            <li> By subpar, I mean it took several tens of minutes to get every hair uprooted from my skin.</li>
            <li> Barely catches hair,  and one charge only lasts 20 min, with the last 5 minutes a slow useless unproductive waste.</li>
            <li> Battery life less than 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> This epilator is a step forward from her previous Epilator ,</li>
            <li> I already have another brand with less tweezers, but thought the IVog would be quicker and remove more/finer hairs.  </li>
            <li> I previously owned the &amp;#34;Emjoi AP-18 Emagine Dual</li>
            <li> /&gt;Is been a week and a half and one of the rotating tweezer heads has stopped rotating.</li>
            <li> Made me think, no matter, how hard or for how long, I used this epilator -</li>
            <li> Of course, it scared me a little.</li>
            <li> Little</li>
            <li> After a few uses, the epilator doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t was completely dead.  </li>
            <li> So i plugged it in and waited a few hours for it to charge.  </li>
            <li> I had tried this before with the braun a few times and the pain had been so unbearable</li>
            <li> Been using it for a few months</li>
            <li> YES, It&#x27;s a little painful at first.</li>
            <li> I would strongly not recommend this epilator to anyone.</li>
            <li> Be aware that if you try to return the product, the company will contact you repeatedly asking you to keep the item and not give it a bad review if they refund part of the price.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, the whole experience was frustrating and wasted a lot of my time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I first started using it, it was somewhat painful, but not unbearable.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t even start to slow down (dying) until I was done</li>
            <li> Yes, the area that you epilate is sort of raw feeling afterwards, but no more than it is if you were to get waxed.</li>
            <li> , two weeks ago (which was unfortunately past the return date), one set of the epilating blades STOPPED working.</li>
            <li> the hard facts&lt;br</li>
            <li> it was just a dull pain.</li>
            <li> Then on the third time the pain  really wasnt as bad but after using it thd third time I started getting ingrown hairs (horrible).  </li>
            <li> It DOES CHARGE but the manual said something that it needs at least 6 hours(?)</li>
            <li> Handle it like a bomb and work slowly.</li>
            <li> a slow process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery lasts about an hour</li>
            <li> Finally, no more shaving!</li>
            <li> I had used it no more than 5 times and already it is broken.</li>
            <li> I tried an epilator years ago, and it was very painful and it didn&#x27;t work very well at all.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very noisy to operate, and if you&#x27;re used to epilating, the hair removal isn&#x27;t painful.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the worst ever purchased by my for hair removal.</li>
            <li> BUT IT IS GETTING TIRED</li>
            <li> Much worse than my Braun Silk Epil.</li>
            <li> but my face is broken out with in grown hairs</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s say it was less painful than getting a tattoo.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, my initial intention was not to spend $40 to buy a shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am frustrated and unhappy with this product.</li>
            <li> Is it defective or did they write the product description wrong?</li>
            <li> I will admit though it can be extremely painful</li>
            <li> but if you use the 1st on course hair it will just be painful and</li>
            <li> I hate it, it always hurts, even though you do get used to the pain it still hurts, and it always makes my legs break out so bad.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;very very very disappointing hair removal item ever bought.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I hate hate</li>
            <li> I bought this because i HATED shaving my underarms.  </li>
            <li> DAUGHTER HATED IT.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> Awful.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now resorted to using just the shaver part of the product, which works alright albeit with a TERRIBLE battery life.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> does not work while plugged. Battery life less than 30 minutes. I Do not recommend it !!!!!!</li>
            <li> After a few uses, the epilator doesn&#x27;t work well. I charge it but it doesn&#x27;t stay on for long before I have to charge it again. I should&#x27;ve bought an epilator from a trustable brand like Panasonic or emjoi.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the worst ever purchased by my for hair removal. It did not work well ever but some how, I kept using for a while till it would just keep running and leave all the hair intact on skin. Made me think, no matter, how hard or for how long, I used this epilator - my hair were just saying &amp;#34;catch me if you can&amp;#34; and XTweeze, just gave up. It was a total waste of my money and anguish I had, using it.&lt;br /&gt;I have used other products and have them working for 7/9 years, still in perfect condition. This conked off so quickly. God knows where are they getting them assembled/ manufactured.&lt;br /&gt;very very very disappointing hair removal item ever bought.</li>
            <li> I started to use the product and the ball bearings started to pop out of the product. I thought I would be able to replace the product  by ivog, but they didn&#x27;t give that as an option. I guess I will send it back and wait two weeks for the refund and then try to find an epilator that works. Another four weeks to get a quality product from a better company, I hope. Thanks iVog!</li>
            <li> My review is subjective since I have not used it. I had never heard of this brand but I bought this as a gift for my son based on the reviews. I have owned many different brands and if his review is favorable then I will buy one for myself. I like the fact that it also has a shaver.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t owned for very long and have only used this Epilator twice but was very happy with how it worked.....so far great product!!</li>
            <li> This item only worked on my underarms and not at all on my face or my legs.  It is a tweezer machine so of course the hair will grow back consistently.  Company emails you to buy back the product if you say you will not leave negative feedback to avoid giving unsuspecting future customers the correct impression of their product - That it does not work!  BEWARE!</li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfied with product. It holds the charge good. Portable ( I don&#x27;t have to sit next to the outlet). I do not use a regular razor at all. I mostly use epilator. However, some times I don&#x27;t have enough time, so I have an option to use a shaver.&lt;br /&gt;The head of the epilator is wide, so the process goes fast. First I thought it makes no difference, but it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this because i HATED shaving my underarms.  My underarm hair is really thick and dark compared with my light complexion, and shaving just made the stubble reappear within 24 hours.  With this epilator, it removes all of the hair under my arms from the root and it doesn&#x27;t hurt me at all. My underarms have become so much lighter now and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results!  This worked really well for my arms and some hairs on my stomach as well.&lt;br /&gt;I DID try this on my face, and it does remove the small amounts of hair on my upperlip, but it does hurt a lot more than the rest of my body.  But overall most of my upper lip hairs are gone which is a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside was trying this on my legs.  My leg hair is course and thick and the follicles are more... dispersed than they would be under my arms.  It didn&#x27;t really pick up the hairs from the roots but instead just broke them or didn&#x27;t get picked up at all.  I showered and exfoliated before and after using it on my legs, but I still got bumps after using.  I didn&#x27;t get any bumps when I tried this on the other parts of my body.&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL: this products is great and easy to use.  It DOES CHARGE but the manual said something that it needs at least 6 hours(?) to be fully charged.  Just leave it on overnight and you&#x27;ll be good to use it in the morning!  None of my heads broke, and I&#x27;ve used this about three times a week for a month. even when i got a small thread from my shirt caught in it, the epilator didn&#x27;t break which I was super impressed with.</li>
            <li> It works great, can&#x27;t be plugged in and used at the same time. But it really gets the job done.</li>
            <li> the description of this product is &#x27;dual opposed 72 tweezer&#x27; which is the same terminology emjoi uses for their epilator - but at half the price. i thought i would try this one first. however if you look closely you can see that in the emjoi each metal piece is actually two tweezers in one, making this one only 36 tweezers. the device itself is a lot bigger than the emjoi with half as many tweezers and as such I found it more painful than the emjoi ap18</li>
            <li> I was looking to find a good epilator at an affordable cost.  I have an old braun silk, that is probably 5 years old.  I hate it, it always hurts, even though you do get used to the pain it still hurts, and it always makes my legs break out so bad.  I looked on amazon to find the best epilator. After reading the reviews the ivog seemed like a good choice, even though I had never heard of this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the package arrived the epilator seemed to be charged, so I used it right away.  Its didn&#x27;t hurt!  amazing, and it was doing a pretty good job at removing the hair.  So after going over both legs I decided to charge it up overnight so I would know that it was fully charged.  The next day my legs weren&#x27;t broken out like the usually get with my old braun.  I thought this was going to be the best epilator ever.&lt;br /&gt;Well I gave it a couple of days, because I didn&#x27;t want to irritate my legs right away.  I got it out and started to go over my legs, and not even 5 minutes it died.  I thought I had charged it long enough, but maybe I hadn&#x27;t. I read in the description that you could use it while plugged into the cord.  so I plugged it in and got nothing!  It didn&#x27;t was completely dead.  So i plugged it in and waited a few hours for it to charge.  I turned it on and again it seemed to work, but died after a couple of minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am returning this product because you can&#x27;t use it with the cord, and It doesn&#x27;t charge up enough to be able to use it.  Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> The iVog has a very fast rotation and a large number of tweezers, which pulls the hair out faster, thus reducing the pain and making it more efficient. Even with it pulling it pulled more hairs at a time, the speed made it hurt less than the braun I had been using. Compared to my braun, it takes me 1/5 of the time and has 1/10th of the pain and does a much better job on most areas.&lt;br /&gt;I found that the braun broke the hair off, the iVog pulls hair out at the root which leaves my legs feeling smoother longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Specific areas and pain...the hard facts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Legs:&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this epilator on my legs, I wasn&#x27;t sure I was using it correctly because it didn&#x27;t hurt. I could barely feel it pulling out the hairs, even though it was doing so much more efficiently than the braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Underarms:&lt;br /&gt;does a fabulous job- just be sure that your skin is 100% dry before you begin or it will really hurt and won&#x27;t be very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;fine hair on arms and stomach:&lt;br /&gt;Worked great, this one grasped the fine hair much better than the emjoi and only required 2 passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bikini area:&lt;br /&gt;iVog produced the smoothest result.&lt;br /&gt;This area did hurt the first time I did it; but it was tolerable...eye watering pain, not screaming in pain. Also, I was able to make it through the whole area in one sitting. I had tried this before with the braun a few times and the pain had been so unbearable I had to stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power that the cordless has is amazing it seems like its plugged into the wall power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this one over the braun or emjoi any day....the time I am saving is astounding!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Holidays</li>
            <li> Just use a razor or hair removal cream. Not worth the Pain.</li>
            <li> My 1st epilator! There were so many to choose from but I chose this one because it has 72 tweezer head! During my first use on my underarms, it felt like little shocks! Don&#x27;t worry, the pain was bearable. Let&#x27;s say it was less painful than getting a tattoo. I guess that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s supposed to feel like when you have 72 tweezers working quickly to pull out all the hair! As it progressed, I didn&#x27;t noticed the pain anymore. The design was nice because it fits comfortably in my hands, which makes it very easily to maneuver. Good value! Overall, I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Good product I should of bought one that was water proof, I would be able to use for more purposes, brut this one is doing what it&#x27;s supposed to be doing.</li>
            <li> Ok... I have to say it hurts a LOT the first time. I got red irritated bumps everywhere and considered returning. But I read other reviews and decided to stick with it. After the 3rd or 4th time using, I got used to the pain and the red bumps stopped happening. Yes, the area that you epilate is sort of raw feeling afterwards, but no more than it is if you were to get waxed. This has been a great and less expensive alternative to waxing for me.</li>
            <li> I am writing this review on behalf of my wife, who use an Epilator on a regular basis - she has used one for years, rather than shaving or waxing. This epilator is a step forward from her previous Epilator ,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, its cordless, which is a huge plus compared to the other one she had, so she can now use the epilator where ever it is convenient for her, not bound by where the plugs are. The unit itself is well designed with the 72 head, and fits easily in the hand,&lt;br /&gt;As an epilator, it is extremely good, and produces excellent results, although not all functions have been tested to date, such as the hair trimmer. All in all, a very positive step forward, and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with that purchase! I have tried some different brand and I have found the best one, thanks!</li>
            <li> I already have another brand with less tweezers, but thought the IVog would be quicker and remove more/finer hairs.  My old one works so much better, so I&#x27;ll stick with that one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.  The only negative thing I have to say is......how the hair that&#x27;s epilated is all over the product instead of going in a chamber to be cleaned out.  Also some hairs do fall into the epitaltor  and I don&#x27;t know how to clean them out.</li>
            <li> Although I use the basic razor method for my underarms, legs and bikini area, and I prefer tweezing my eyebrows, I can&#x27;t say enough about how well this unit works for my jaw line and chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, running it on your face is not a picnic, but the results make the temporary discomfort oh-so-worth-it. My jaw line is every bit as smooth as when my hairdresser finishes a wax treatment at the salon. Identical results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once in a while, it will skip a hair and not remove it. In that case, instead of going over and over the area, I just whip out the tweezers and grab the stray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The iVog fits very well into my lifestyle, and I have saved its cost already in waxings at the salon.</li>
            <li> Of course, it scared me a little. I have never used one before, but I have waxed, so I knew it was going to hurt. Well, it should be pretty obvious because it&#x27;s ripping out your hair at a high speed...However, it only hurts for a bit then you get used to it. In the spots that I had used it the day before, it actually felt good, but I do have a decent pain tolerance. I have used it twice on my legs and I have used the electric razor on my bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes&lt;br /&gt;-You will NOT get every single hair the first time. I went over my legs several times and it just doesn&#x27;t happen when you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing. Take your time and do as much as you can. You can go over it again in a day or two. It&#x27;s a long-term system&lt;br /&gt;-Battery life is AMAZING. It came to me fully charged! I used it on both legs and the shaver on my bikini area on one charge. It didn&#x27;t even start to slow down (dying) until I was done&lt;br /&gt;-Yes, it does hurt. It doesn&#x27;t take a scientist to figure that out. Be patient. It will hurt the first time, but not as much the second time.&lt;br /&gt;-Think about purchasing a lotion that has a hair growth inhibitor in it. It will make your epilations last longer</li>
            <li> This was my first time using an epilator and I was pleased with the results. I was worried about the pain but I was surpried it was just a dull pain. It took several passes, but my skin was left smooth. Great first experience.</li>
            <li> I previously owned the &amp;#34;Emjoi AP-18 Emagine Dual Opposed 72 Tweezer Head Epilator&amp;#34; but the price bumped up $25 since the last time I purchased it, so when my current Emjoi&#x27;s tweezer head was worn out I decided to buy a new Epilator. Well, although it was nice to have the cordless feature, its absolutely not worth it. It loses power in 30-40 minutes, barely enough time to get both full legs, bikini, and underarms done. And when you plug it in, it will not go as fast. I used it maybe twice and was highly dissatisfied. I instead decided to buy a replacement head for $35 on the actual emjoi store. If you want a good, fast, reliable epilator, go with Emjoi.</li>
            <li> Bought this in March 2014. It does not cut the hair as close as it should.  I can spend 40 minutes on my legs and can still feel stubby hairs. I thought with 72 tweezers it would have been a better unit. I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> First of all, I must say Ivog customer service is awesome. There was an issue with my package, I sincerely believe my local post office misplaced my package. I notified Ivog customer service, their response was prompt and a new package was shipped to me via UPS 2nd day air.I highly recommend this seller to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, this is my very first epilator. I&#x27;m so satisfied with the performance of this product. I&#x27;m a African American woman with very coarse facial hair. Let me tell you when I was finished epilating, my husband thought I had waxed my face. My face is so soft &amp; smooth. I also recommend Exfoliating your skin first for best results. I read an abundant number of reviews on other epilators that were very expensive, but customers were not very satisfied. Look no further, this product has passed the test. YES, It&#x27;s a little painful at first. You will get use to the pain as you continue to use your epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerly,&lt;br /&gt;Happy customer! 😄&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I orginally purchased this product to remove my facial hair. Well, this epilator has done such a great job...I will be epilating my legs, underarms, &amp; bikini area. 😉&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> Already explained several times. NO PAPERWORK, NO INVOICE, NO PROOF OF PURCHASE OTHER THEN THROUGH AMAZON</li>
            <li> For me it hurts enough to where you can handle it but it says to try it in the bath, maybe I am not soaking long enough. I don&#x27;t really like it right now, it is like putting it off because I want to use it but I don&#x27;t because it hurts.....Right now I am not sure if I would ever buy another iVog.</li>
            <li> I LKE IT BUT IT TOOK SOME PRACTICE TO GET USED TO IT. I HAVE ONE NOW THAT I HAVE HAD FOR MANY YEARS AND LOVE IT BUT IT IS GETTING TIRED SO I BOUGHT THIS ONE. JUST REMEMBER THAT IT WORKS BETTER AFTER A HOT SHOWER AND FULLY DRIED OFF. HAIRS ARE MUCH SOFTER THEN. I DO NOT USE IT ON THE UNDERARMS NOR DID I DO THAT WITH MY OLDER ONES, JUST ON MY LEGS BOTH LOWER AND UPPER.</li>
            <li> I loved this epilator for about three and a half weeks, as it was less painful and more effective than any other I&#x27;ve tried. But then one day the plastic became warped or something and the tweezers stopped spinning unless I squeezed it on the sides. Tried to go to the manufacturers website because they claimed there was a warranty, but the website was no longer around and I had to return it to Amazon for a refund. I would have loved to exchange it for a replacement to give it another shot, but Amazon would only refund my purchase and said I could purchase it again, however since I originally got it for 25% off I wasn&#x27;t going to pay full price for something that had already failed to perform well. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> This epilator did a fantastic job and equals one that I have that sold at double the price.  The best feature is that you can use it wireless!!!!  I have been looking for something like this for quite a while and am thrilled that I found it!</li>
            <li> Cheaply made.  Been using it for a few months and it is starting to rattle when used.  Not a quality product.</li>
            <li> I think of this as my own personal torture device. I have a pretty high tolerance for pain but this surpassed it. I had to do it in stages over a week to get my upper body done but it&#x27;s totally worth it. The price of getting an upper body wax for a man on a consistent basis is too much. Fortunately I know that it&#x27;s going to hurt less after the first time and I can maintain myself fairly quickly. The choice was clear, I can pay 50-100$ a month for a wax, spend a half hour a day shaving to maintain a constant chest stubble, or endure a little pain for a half hour a week and look good. I now spend a 10th the time and money and look better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word to the wise. Don&#x27;t try to run this thing across your belly like your getting waxed. Handle it like a bomb and work slowly. Expect a lot of skin irritation the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;++update++&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is been a week and a half and one of the rotating tweezer heads has stopped rotating. I would simply buy a replacement head but they appear to be nowhere on amazon or the internet. I suppose I&#x27;ll have to wait until the other stops and order a new one. I think it will have to be one that has replacement heads online. I did my best to figure it out. I took the whole thing apart, cleaned it out, tried to figure it out. But ultimately, I have no idea one it&#x27;s not functioning.</li>
            <li> Awful.  Much worse than my Braun Silk Epil. Barely catches hair,  and one charge only lasts 20 min, with the last 5 minutes a slow useless unproductive waste.</li>
            <li> Well I was a little scared at first because i&#x27;ve never owned an epilator before, but so far this product has done wonders, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and i&#x27;m completely in love with it. I will admit though it can be extremely painful and you definitely have to let it grow on you!</li>
            <li> So, my roommate uses &amp;#34;Soft Caress&amp;#34; by emjoi, and I really wanted to buy an epilator after hearing her rave about it. So, two months ago (December 2013), I ordered iVog&#x27;s X-Tweez epilator, which at that time had an average of 5 stars. Hoping that I would get a great product, I bought it without a beat. Little did I know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it arrived, it looked awesome: shaving unit, epilator, and more for just $40? Sign me up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT WAIT. Were my expectations too high? I admit that I was dying to get all my hair - every square inch - tweezed out, but lo and behold, when I started using the product, it worked for hmm, maybe 5 minutes? And then it stopped.&lt;br /&gt;If you know anything about epilating, 5 minutes barely gets you pass your first leg. What am I going to do with one hairy leg and one hairless leg?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I wore jeans instead of shorts, and I charged it the whole night. And, it worked subpar for the first week. By subpar, I mean it took several tens of minutes to get every hair uprooted from my skin. Needless to say, the whole experience was frustrating and wasted a lot of my time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, two weeks ago (which was unfortunately past the return date), one set of the epilating blades STOPPED working. I&#x27;ve now resorted to using just the shaver part of the product, which works alright albeit with a TERRIBLE battery life. HOWEVER, my initial intention was not to spend $40 to buy a shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am frustrated and unhappy with this product. My roommate has been using her epilator for 4 years, and it works great. Mine lasted 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not okay. I would strongly not recommend this epilator to anyone. Beware!</li>
            <li> My wife loves it! I was surprised the product arrived quickly and was charged so my wife was able to use it immediately straight out of the package.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time user of epilators and was lured by the 72 tweezer head (which was pretty great as far as speed and comfort for the kind of device it is) BUT the charging part was annoying and didn&#x27;t work well while plugged in, the actual equipment felt cheap and not well made (as opposed to a Braun or a legit Epilady). The shaver wasn&#x27;t very good. I returned mine and bought a Panasonic ES-ED90-P which I&#x27;m really looking forward to owning instead.</li>
            <li> This was my first epilator. I tried my friends epilator and realized the pain is bearable so I decided to order one for myself! I hate hate hate shaving but love that just shaved feeling!  It worked just as expected and I am happy I got this. Word of advice!!! Don&#x27;t epilate before an event because you may get red dots all over your legs from the hair being pulled out. The dots did disappear by the next day tho! Im on day three and my legs are still so much smoother than shaving! WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> WAY TOO MUCH MONEY, DOES NOT PERFORM AS I EXPECTED, SENT IT BACK. DAUGHTER HATED IT. WAY TOO MUCH MONEY.</li>
            <li> This was not how I hoped it would be, when I got it I was so excited! But as I used it, it wasn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;pulling&amp;#34; the hairs as it said. Instead it was more like cutting them quite a disappointment to be honest. I would no get this again instead I would rather got wax my leg hair.</li>
            <li> I love it! Only have to shave every 3 months or so</li>
            <li> Love this product. This is my 1st epilator and I love it. Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever shave my legs again. I love that it&#x27;s rechargeable and light weight.</li>
            <li> Reviews were so good for this unit. It DID come charged so I was able to try to for a bit. It didn&#x27;t do much better on my legs than my 10 year old epilator, but since it was supposed to work both on battery AND plugged in, I figured it was somewhat of an upgrade. HOWEVER, once the battery ran out, I plugged it in so I could use it with the adapter. The light came on like the unit was charging until I turned it on again...then it stopped working. So it doesn&#x27;t work plugged in. I guess the unit is defective, but no reason to keep it at this point. --Reviewed by account-holder&#x27;s wife.&lt;br /&gt;Editing to add that the company has begun calling me to tell me the unit is not defective, and that I don&#x27;t know how to read. They tell me *I* misunderstood the product description that says, \\&quot;iVog X-Tweez can be used wirelessly after charging it for about 6 hrs, it can work for 30-40 minutes after a full charge. If it shows low battery capacity, you can insert the AC plug into the product to work.\\&quot; Not much to misunderstand there... Also, we returned this product over six weeks ago, why are they bothering us now about it? The truth is, the product description said it did one thing and the product did not do that. Is it defective or did they write the product description wrong? Who knows, not my problem. Either way, it did not perform as described.

            <li> I used it on my chin and don&#x27;t have too many hairs but I could not believe how smooth my skin was after. This is the first time I ever used an epilator and it was a little scarey at first but then you get use to it. So far not bad.</li>
            <li> It works okay, but after 3 uses, one side broke.  Also doesn&#x27;t get all of the hair and a lot of hairs tends to break off.</li>
            <li> Purchased The iVog Xtweez dual Opposed 72 Tweezer Head Epilator is quite simply the best epilator I have ever used. It&#x27;s easy to use, has plenty of power in its two power settings, and the 72 tweezer heads significantly reduce the amount of time epilating takes. Other epilators could take me an hour to do my legs, since I would have to go over the same area repeatedly to get all of the hairs. With 72 tweezer heads and plenty of power, I think the xtweez takes under 10 minutes to do both legs. It&#x27;s not very noisy to operate, and if you&#x27;re used to epilating, the hair removal isn&#x27;t painful. If you aren&#x27;t used to epilating, any epilator will be painful for the first several uses. Even cleaning out this epilator is great.The ivog xtweex is well priced than many of the other epilators on the market, but the superior performance makes it well worth the price. I wouldn&#x27;t trade mine for anything!</li>
            <li> I purchased the epilator for my cousin she just loves it.She says it works best on the lower speed. It does the job very well on her face and legs.</li>
            <li> Even though this epilator cost a little more than some of the other ones listed on Amazon here, I bought it thinking that since it was a 72 head tweezer it would work better/more efficient. It does not work better. (FYI- I am not a very hairy person, I have to tweeze every few weeks only). It barely tweezes my under arms, I have to run the head over my legs several times to tweeze all the hairs and it still misses spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery does last long. The 2 speed option makes no difference.</li>
            <li> I used this product a total of 3 times and it seemed to be working good meaning removing hair , it was somewhat painful the first couple times. Then on the third time the pain  really wasnt as bad but after using it thd third time I started getting ingrown hairs (horrible).  So In the beginning i loved epilating it kept the hair off for at least 8 days I dont know what happened but my face is broken out with in grown hairs</li>
            <li> This epilator works great!  I tried an epilator years ago, and it was very painful and it didn&#x27;t work very well at all.  While researching, I bought this one based on the reviews, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  When I first started using it, it was somewhat painful, but not unbearable.  So, I used it for three days to get the first initial procedure done.  After that, it is really like doing touchups and doesn&#x27;t hurt at all!  I&#x27;m 53, and I finally have soft, hair-free legs and underarms!  Finally, no more shaving!</li>
            <li> This works awesome. I really like it. My legs do not always come smooth, but since this is my first epilator I think this could be my inexperience.</li>
            <li> My second epilator.&lt;br /&gt;It is a 1/10 compared to my much cheaper first epilator that lasted 8 years.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this one at all</li>
            <li> Okay so I bought this back in December 2013 because I&#x27;m tired of shaving my hooha and I do not have the guts to effectively pull a wax strip. When I first tried it out on my legs I thought &amp;#34;Well this is painless!!&amp;#34; When I tried it on my nether-regions I could only go halfway then I had to quit because the pain became too much to handle and I had to resume the next day. My next session though I was able to finish in one sitting as it wasn&#x27;t really painful. The tweezers are great and don&#x27;t really break any hairs if you use the right setting for the area you&#x27;re epilating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Legs or thinner hair: 1st speed setting&lt;br /&gt;Course hair: 2nd speed setting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use the 2nd speed on thinner hair you will experience hair breaking instead of removal but if you use the 1st on course hair it will just be painful and a slow process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery lasts about an hour but I find that after 6 months the battery doesn&#x27;t last as long as it used to. You can use it while it chargers but it doesn&#x27;t give you any power. It either charges OR it removes hair but not both at the same time so if you want to do your entire body you have to let it fully charge then start and try to get it done in an hour or you have to wait for it to charge again</li>
            <li> I had purchase this product back in April 2014. I had used it no more than 5 times and already it is broken. I do not like this product because it takes hours to charge and it does not even last long enough to tweeze one leg. You can not use it when your skin is wet, you can not use it without the charger, it is a bit bulky when holding compare to other products. Not only that, the product is now shutting off when you are tweezing so now I just don&#x27;t use it at all. I have contacted the company and still waiting on a reply. I will not suggest for any one to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Large, to heavy, did not take hair off.  Would not stay charged.</li>
            <li> It worked good in the beginning but broke after just two weeks of use.</li>
