            <li>I like it just fine...</li>
            <li>It chips just as quickly as cheaper brands and still requires more than one coat.</li>
            <li>Not that fantastic in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Nice white nail polish like most nail polish though it is tricky to apply and tends to streak.</li>
            <li>you know the drill, it is a great white and it right up there with alpine snow by OPI, had no problems</li>

            <li>Love essie nail polish and white is a need for the looks and designs I want.</li>
            <li>Product came fast and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>

            <li>The color is fine with this, but it goes on really unevenly.</li>
            <li>It Essie nail polish, it&#x27;s white, it&#x27;s expensive but somehow better than the cheap guys.</li>
            <li>But with Essie, I expect more than a few days last.</li>
            <li>I love this nail polish and use it for a lot of my manis because it&#x27;s just plain white!</li>
            <li>You have to be super careful while applying as french tips because this nail polish likes to go all over the place.</li>
            <li>I love all Essie nail polishes but the white is a little tough going on...definitely takes two coats and you have to make sure it&#x27;s not going on too thick or it will take forever to dry.</li>

            <li> Only buy if you don&#x27;t have any other white nail polish</li>
            <li> I was worried that like some other white polishes I&#x27;ve seen that it would end up looking like I&#x27;d put white out on my nails.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use Essie as long as they make it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty thick takes about two coats to make even but not gloopy!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too thick, like maybe it&#x27;s old?</li>
            <li> Speaking of the color, its a cream white color, and its usually opaque in 2 coats.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just because of the topcoat I use and the lack of a bottom coat, but the 3 times i&#x27;ve used this on myself and one time on a friend, my nails were chipped and cracked in less than 24 hours.</li>
            <li> However, this one was a little too watery.</li>
            <li> Arrived a few days after purchase, no complaints.</li>
            <li> While I was applying it, a few drops dripped onto the table.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as nice as the other Essie colors I have used.  </li>
            <li> I have several different brands of white polish but this one chips the worst.</li>
            <li> I have never experienced this with any other Essie nail polishes.</li>
            <li> Runs a little thin, but gets the job done,</li>
            <li> I wanted something very white, and almost chalky for an edgy look, but this is impossible to apply.</li>
            <li> The reason is that it is a little watery, but not too bad, Over all i would definitly suggest this to a friend</li>
            <li> Cant got wrong with essie.</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> it kinda made me mad.</li>
            <li> I was greatly disappointed!</li>
            <li> Polish chips terribly.</li>

            <li> another great essie polish. Cant got wrong with essie. Product came fast and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish and use it for a lot of my manis because it&#x27;s just plain white! But with Essie, I expect more than a few days last. I am a swimmer and this polish comes off a lot more easily than it should!</li>
            <li> when I got my package the mailman had to charge me extra for the shipping, cause they didn&#x27;t pay for all of it! it kinda made me mad. but other than that its a good nail polish.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just because of the topcoat I use and the lack of a bottom coat, but the 3 times i&#x27;ve used this on myself and one time on a friend, my nails were chipped and cracked in less than 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. It&#x27;s pretty thick takes about two coats to make even but not gloopy! Arrived a few days after purchase, no complaints.</li>

            <li> Polish chips terribly. I have several different brands of white polish but this one chips the worst.</li>
            <li> Essies white nail polish is a very good polish and it doesn&#x27;t chip a lot. I find that one coat is not enough because it is kinda streaky. After two coats, and a top coat i cannot complain! It is very pigmented and great for making small designs. I like to wear it with a matte top coat. I chose four stars for one reason only. The reason is that it is a little watery, but not too bad, Over all i would definitly suggest this to a friend and I will be re-purchasing. It also came in the mail 4 days after i ordered it!!</li>
            <li> Gorgeous color, looks great on by itself as well as working like an undercoat. Definitely a white I would recommend.</li>
            <li> The color is fine with this, but it goes on really unevenly. It&#x27;s streaky and I couldn&#x27;t get it to go on in an even coat no matter what I tried. I had to toss it out. I&#x27;m sticking with OPI nail polish from now on.</li>
            <li> Love essie nail polish and white is a need for the looks and designs I want. love love love it!</li>
            <li> Chips easily, and layers on weirdly. I love white nail polish, but this one isn&#x27;t the best. Still, I&#x27;ll give it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I was greatly disappointed! I was looking for &#x27;clear&#x27; and it turned out to be stark white. Sorry. Still looking for&#x27; clear&#x27;!</li>
            <li> Very solid white, covers in a couple coats.</li>
            <li> It Essie nail polish, it&#x27;s white, it&#x27;s expensive but somehow better than the cheap guys. I like it just fine...</li>
            <li> I ordered this polish in white (blanc). I was worried that like some other white polishes I&#x27;ve seen that it would end up looking like I&#x27;d put white out on my nails. Or that the color wouldn&#x27;t be a true white. But this polish went on very smooth and the color is wonderful. I&#x27;ve never used Essie before, but I think I&#x27;ve found a new favorite polish.</li>
            <li> This works great as a base coat for nail art but is too runny to work great as french tips. You have to be super careful while applying as french tips because this nail polish likes to go all over the place. Still great cream white to draw over and dries really fast in true Essie style!</li>
            <li> Not nearly as nice as the other Essie colors I have used.  Did not paint on smoothly or last as long without chipping.</li>
            <li> opaque with two coats... you know the drill, it is a great white and it right up there with alpine snow by OPI, had no problems</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t get all the hype aabout Essie. I loved the white, however I don&#x27;t feel like Essie is that superb of a polish. It chips just as quickly as cheaper brands and still requires more than one coat. Not that fantastic in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I love all Essie nail polishes but the white is a little tough going on...definitely takes two coats and you have to make sure it&#x27;s not going on too thick or it will take forever to dry. I will continue to shop around for the perfect white. To sum it up...I liked it but did not love it.</li>
            <li> beautiful white color!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Essie nail polish products for years and find they are the best performing for their price.  I will continue to use Essie as long as they make it.  My manicurist has recommended different colors for my French manicure over the years, but I stick with Essie Blanc for the tips and Essie Waltz for the overall nail.  Love it with my coloring.</li>
            <li> I bought Essie because I am falling in love with their nail polishes, since they are fast drying and long lasting. However, this one was a little too watery. While I was applying it, a few drops dripped onto the table. I have never experienced this with any other Essie nail polishes. Speaking of the color, its a cream white color, and its usually opaque in 2 coats. Its an okay polish, I wouldn&#x27;t re-purchase.</li>
            <li> This product has the greatest density for laying down French nails. It has great covering capacity if one prefers to lay it over areas that need concealing.</li>
            <li> Runs a little thin, but gets the job done,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like white out. I wanted something very white, and almost chalky for an edgy look, but this is impossible to apply. It&#x27;s too thick, like maybe it&#x27;s old?</li>
