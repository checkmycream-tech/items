            <li>It is almost too bright.</li>
            <li>My daughter however, thinks it is too bright.</li>

            <li>it is nicely lit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It gives off alot of good, bright light.</li>
            <li>This is a NICE mirror, basically.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own while in use</li>
            <li>For the 23 days I used it, I liked it.</li>
            <li>Because I own Ott lights for my knitting, I thought I&#x27;d try this.</li>
            <li>The mirror no longer spins on its own yet still turns easily!</li>
            <li>I love the bright light on this mirror!</li>
            <li>Very bright mirror, large mirror too.</li>
            <li>The non-magnified side was fine, and the lighting was good, as are all the Ott-lite products I have used.  </li>
            <li>The light is so bright there is no way I will miss anything.</li>
            <li>So far this is the best!</li>
            <li>I found the light to be way to bright for applying makeup.</li>
            <li>She really liked the one she had and was pleased with the replacement.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best one I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen some reviewers say the light was too bright, which just kinda confuses me-</li>
            <li>After trying many different make-up mirrors, I&#x27;m delighted to say; this one is awesome.</li>
            <li>Excellent quality, very bright light that is very close to daylight, and decent sized mirror with magnification as well....</li>
            <li>The old mirror was great and worked good for years.  </li>
            <li>I can wedge a piece of folded paper in the side to keep it in place, which is OK with me because the light is so good.</li>
            <li>The light is bright with mirrors on both sides love it.  </li>
            <li>Very happy, light is bright enough, matches my vanity desk.</li>
            <li>pretty great buy.</li>
            <li>I suppose I should have stuck with the tried and true ones, for as good as OTT lights are, this product is sub-par.</li>
            <li>Its very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light-weight and not a true glass mirror, but it&#x27;s a good size and meets her needs perfectly.</li>
            <li>The lighting is very bright and natural.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The light it gives off is VERY bright but also VERY neutral-toned.</li>
            <li>I liked the light</li>
            <li>Better then I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this mirror.</li>
            <li>I think this is the next best thing.</li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>Love this makeup mirror.</li>
            <li>She has the mirror on a dressing table and keeps her make-up in the top dresser drawer.  </li>
            <li>OUTSTANDING  </li>
            <li>, this mirror will help for sure.</li>
            <li>Tacky, cheaply made and not even good light.</li>
            <li>I have had many makeup mirrors over the years.  </li>
            <li>The magnified side does more distorting than magnifying.  </li>
            <li>there are better mirrors out there.</li>
            <li>One of the pictures had a reflection in the mirror which they tried to say was a crack, so more pictures.  </li>
            <li>After searching the net I found what I feel is the best makeup mirror I have ever had...</li>
            <li>but there should be some more tension</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Fantastic mirror!</li>
            <li>and I love how it swivels.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m able to see all the details of my face</li>
            <li>It was delivered to my house within the same week of ordering, and packaged perfectly.</li>
            <li>This mirror is substantially brighter and has a better magnifying side.</li>
            <li>and I love it so much more than I could&#x27;ve ever imagined</li>
            <li>The light is bright and fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if I am going to be able to use it or not.  </li>
            <li>Hoping I will be able to get used to it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it is a good mirror, the fact it is well lit makes it worth it.</li>
            <li>I must agree with most, the mirror does not stay put kept moving/rolling.</li>
            <li>I bought this mirror for a gift for my mother to replace a mirror I bought her many years ago.</li>
            <li>and I love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this makeup mirror.  </li>
            <li>I love this mirror.</li>
            <li>I love this makeup mirror.  </li>
            <li>Love this mirror.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Wanting something more inconspicuous</li>
            <li>I wish that I had an Ott light in the bathroom mirrors also!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I thought I would love this mirror.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic mirror for the price!</li>
            <li>It would have been a great mirror the way the lights worked, but the reflection was very distorted.  </li>
            <li>It is the perfect height for sitting at a regular chair and table.</li>
            <li>Intense bright natural lighting, so perfect for doing my makeup!</li>
            <li>the lighting its great i really recomended</li>
            <li>shape was just okay.</li>
            <li>is the best makeup mirror there is, especially for the woman who has aging eyes!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>light works gets a bit warm</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this piece and how quickly it arrived.</li>
            <li>The light itself is nice - provides a good, true light for viewing.  </li>
            <li>Great light quality, love that it is adjustable (mirror can be moved higher or lower).</li>
            <li>This light is super bright, which I appreciate because i basically do my makeup in a cave.</li>
            <li>Light was good, but didn&#x27;t make up for the distortion, and I am quite surprised as it had good reviews.</li>
            <li>I feel confident that I look well put together when using this mirror, which is more and more important as years go by.</li>
            <li>Really loveeeeee the natural daylight mirror, it is perfect, except the mirror keeps moving on its own.</li>
            <li>Additionally, if you go to the Ott-lite website, it seems that these lights are not only beautiful, bright, and as close to daylight as you can imagine indoors, but they are also full spectrum lights....</li>
            <li>The mirror(s) are clear and the light is very bright.</li>
            <li>But its an easy fix and there are many ways to solve the issue (clip, rubber band etc.).</li>
            <li>I got this because I needed a brighter light, and bright it definitely is, like overwhelmingly bright.</li>
            <li>I love this light.</li>
            <li>Reminded her that normal vision is not magnified and nobody looks at her through that kind of a lens!    </li>
            <li>The most egregious feature of this mirror for me was the blinding light.  </li>
            <li>One of the lights needs a &amp;#34;tap &amp;#34; to light up most of the time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s terrific, and I&#x27;m very pleased with the bright lighting.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find a better light for the money.</li>
            <li>and I loved it so much I needed one for my dorm room as well</li>
            <li>The service was good and was here fast.</li>
            <li>The light is ok and the size of the mirror is fine for make-up.  </li>
            <li>The lighting is great -- it&#x27;s a nice clean, white light, unlike the yellowish light of most mirrors.</li>
            <li>The light on the left wasn&#x27;t very bright.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to find a 5x mirror, as most are 10x which is too strong for me.  </li>
            <li>Great light reflect natural color of complexion &amp; hair.</li>
            <li>The left one was working and it is nice \\&quot;clean\\&quot; bright light.</li>
            <li>The lighting is terrific, the appearence of the mirror is just beautiful.  </li>
            <li>Best price on Amazon, well below average retail price.</li>
            <li>Have had for 2 years and still working fine.</li>
            <li>I have used cheap 10X magnifying mirrors that functioned fine</li>
            <li>I think it may be a full-spectrum light.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great - the magnifying mirror is such a help.  </li>
            <li>And its the kind of light that is kind of blue, not so flattering.</li>
            <li>Also made out of flimsy cheap plastic that feels really cheap.</li>
            <li>The on/off switch felt cheap</li>
            <li>and after I got my makeup on and saw what I looked like in the light of day</li>
            <li>The light hasn&#x27;t dulled.</li>
            <li>The mirror wouldn&#x27;t stay put, and the light was distracting rather than helpful.</li>
            <li>The light is a plastic, made in China POS.&lt;br /&gt;Buyer be warned if you&#x27;re looking for quality</li>
            <li>The only flaw is that the mirror won&#x27;t stay in place, I have to put a pencil to keep it in place, otherwise, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>This mirror is fantastic.</li>
            <li>The light is bright enough, unlike many make up mirrors out there</li>
            <li>The lighting on this mirror is clear and bright.  </li>
            <li>so I always have to have something between the mirror and light</li>
            <li>After 24 hours of owning this, my husband convinced me to return the mirror, calling it a cheap piece of plastic junk.</li>
            <li>The light is bright and mimics natural light, size is big enough to see your face and neck and magnifying side is very handy for me since my sight is not so good</li>
            <li>The light is wonderful on this mirror and makes me wonder how I got along without it in the past.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>but the &#x27;true&#x27; light is what I wanted.</li>
            <li>When you are satisfied with how you look up close and personal in your Ott-lite mirror (i.e. you&#x27;ve done all you can), you can be confident you look good to everyone with normal vision.</li>
            <li>It really does give me better light than led or incandescent.</li>
            <li>It is nothing like a dim Conair, it&#x27;s so much better, but don&#x27;t buy it if you don&#x27;t want to be able to see your face.  </li>
            <li>The light on this mirror is adequate but after a time, the mirror began to move while applying makeup.  </li>
            <li>and  the light is so bright that you can actually see what you are doing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love how the light panels on each side really let you get any details you might overlook otherwise.  </li>
            <li>It is well made and the light is so bright that you can actually see what you are doing.  </li>
            <li>so I would highly recommend it to anyone who needs more light when applying make-up</li>
            <li>Working well, lights are bright and she uses it regularly.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a pretty great mirror overall.</li>
            <li>Lighting is bright enough to do what you need to do.  </li>
            <li>I essentially wanted two things: bright, true-to-life colored lighting, and a design that wasn&#x27;t so hideous that I&#x27;d be embarrassed about leaving it out all the time.  </li>
            <li>and I think it was an overall good investment.</li>
            <li>This effect cannot be good over extended daily use.  </li>
            <li>I hope he never finds out how much I paid for it - thank god for Amazon&#x27;s free returns!</li>
            <li>am glad I found it for a good price through Amazon (half of the msrp)</li>
            <li>Other than that, I am very satisfied with this!</li>
            <li>The product arrived with the light in the right not working.  </li>
            <li>However, the mirror works well, the light is the right &amp;#34;color&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m not having the &amp;#34;auto flip&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This mirror is nice looking, perfect lighting for putting makeup on, and the magnification is just right, but I had to go through 2 other of the same mirror to get it right.  </li>
            <li>I experienced none of the problem&#x27;s other folks did.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just like every other mag mirror I&#x27;ve ever used and works great.</li>
            <li>and I liked the weight of the product (heavy for a makeup mirror), but I am returning it because the mirror flips on its own.  </li>
            <li>Nice build quality, only one light setting,</li>
            <li>You may get lucky</li>
            <li>So far, I love this light.  </li>
            <li>I love the natural light effect it provides</li>
            <li>I can now put on my makeup without any worry because I can see so well and realize that it will look super wherever I go.</li>
            <li>Seems like it takes a minute or two before light is fully bright but small price to pay for such a great mirror.</li>
            <li>pros: light is strong, like the flip mirror where one side is normal and</li>
            <li>What I have found is that the reviews about the mirror itself were pretty accurate.  </li>
            <li>While this mirror does give true strong natural light, and the 5x side is plenty for applying all eye makeup but</li>
            <li>It is also easily mobile if she wants to take it somewhere else.</li>
            <li>I wish I would have bought this one first!</li>
            <li>The only thing better would be to have a full vanity set-up like theatre/opera/broadway stars do!</li>
            <li>The first day I used it the right light turned off on me.</li>
            <li>The light itself is super bright and shows every little detail of your face.  </li>
            <li>My old mirror quick working after many years</li>
            <li>I have very dim light in my bedroom, and no lighted makeup mirror I bought was ever bright enough.. until this one!</li>
            <li>This is a great mirror for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>They give a &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; light that will show whether colors and textures really go together - ever put on an outfit and then look at yourself in sunlight and realize that the colors you have on don&#x27;t go together at all?</li>
            <li>The lights were not as bright as I expected</li>
            <li>I had the oval Conair light before this one and found it was clunkier and took up too much counter space.  </li>
            <li>although much nicer to look at does not give me the light I exected.  </li>
            <li>but I enjoyed my old Clairol mirror with all</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Mirror looked like you are in a fun house at the carnival.  </li>
            <li>Simple and effective,</li>
            <li>It was so distorted, it reminded me of looking into a circus fun house mirror.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>After leaving my house one too many times thinking my makeup looked fabulous only to realize I looked like a clown in the daylight, I went out in search of a lighted makeup mirror.  </li>
            <li>The mirror rotates &amp; rarely stays in place.  </li>
            <li>I love my old lighted mirror because the magnifying side is just right.  </li>
            <li>I own other Ott light products that I use for reading and crafting.  </li>
            <li>Very nice looking &amp; heavy ....</li>
            <li>and I want it to look right</li>
            <li>I like this mirror because of the natural true light, and 2 sided magnification.</li>
            <li>It has a clean modern look.</li>
            <li>This mirror does exactly what the description says it will: show the true color of makeup and clothes and give an accurate picture of what makeup looks like in natural sunlight.</li>
            <li>The light is really blue and not flattering for makeup application and not even bright enough either.</li>
            <li>Looks nice, the bend to the mirror is strange but doesn&#x27;t  bother me.</li>
            <li>If you are flip flopping about the pricelet me add that I definitely think it was worth the extra money, as it seems to be a great quality mirror, and seems pretty durable.  </li>
            <li>Disapopointed, like the like itself, but the right hand side bulb quit after the first use.</li>
            <li>It was also delivered quickly and packaged very well.</li>
            <li>This mirror replaces an old Conair that just wasn&#x27;t bright enough.</li>
            <li>Great for people who either don&#x27;t want to shell out the money for a bigger vanity mirror, or who don&#x27;t have enough space for one and still want the quality a lighted mirror provides.</li>
            <li>A large rubber band around the top half is a quick, easy fix</li>
            <li>The size of the mirror itself is great too, as most of the smaller circular mirrors are just too small for</li>
            <li>I Love the light, but like every other review I read, it won&#x27;t stay where you position it.</li>
            <li>I reccomend this mirror to any woman who is serious about having her face look beautiful.</li>
            <li>I use it to shave and it has helped me greatly with getting all those hard to visualize beard hairs on the neck and elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>I am a professional makeup artist, and I highly recommend this mirror for anyone looking for better lighting and magnification when doing their makeup, tweezing eyebrows, etc.</li>
            <li>I bought my first one at Ross for my room</li>
            <li>I love this mirror, I can actually see my face</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it will do</li>
            <li>overall, glad I bought it, but it could use some design improvements.</li>
            <li>Be sure you want this exact magnification because it makes the mirror size too small for the position you will need to be in to be able to see ...  and the lights are not adjustable.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s settings way better and the big difference in price.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this light two times and each time it quits working before it is six months old.</li>
            <li>The first one came in with the mirror cracked, the second one had a strange magnification problem that seemed distorted, but I&#x27;m glad I tried again because this final mirror is great</li>
            <li>Also, the lights are hot.</li>
            <li>I definitely have owned better mirrors then this one</li>
            <li>Satisfied that it was recently purchased they then wanted pictures of the mirror with the electrical cord cut, which I sent.  </li>
            <li>The regular side wasn&#x27;t much better.  </li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>I love the daylight spectrum bulbs in this mirror, but the actual mirror piece tilts/swivels and doesn&#x27;t click into place.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Would not have bought it if I had seen it first.</li>
            <li>I have other Ott-Lite products and purchased this due to the excellent lighting.</li>
            <li>Well all I can say is that it seems like most magnified mirrors that I&#x27;ve ever seen in that if you don&#x27;t get close enough to it, you can get a funhouse effect.  </li>
            <li>at first when i received item, one bulb was out i contacted the company, i throught</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed for atop my vanity table.</li>
            <li>so I wanted something with bright, natural light and somewhat small.</li>
            <li>I do wish the revolving mirror had a little more friction so it would stay securely in one place and angle.</li>
            <li>Lights are great as her bedroom lighting is not good.  </li>
            <li>general construction is cheap.</li>
            <li>I have had many many make up mirrors, and was always disappointed with the light not being bright enough..</li>
            <li>No settings of any kind for position or .&lt;br /&gt;Was not worth the money to me.</li>
            <li>have noticed that very few \\&quot;made in China\\&quot; products are of good quality</li>
            <li>It is very steady with a sturdy stand.</li>
            <li>At first my mirror would stay in place but after a few months it just turns on its own.</li>
            <li>The button works very well, and the cord is more than long enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was well packed and although large, is not too large.  </li>
            <li>You have to press it a certain way to get it to turn on.</li>
            <li>We found that the magnification was too large and distorted the image.  </li>
            <li>I was tempted to leave it a lesser rating but everything else about it is fine.</li>
            <li>, I was hoping to get a &#x27;good&#x27; one but had no such luck, also when we swiveled the mirror we could hear a loose object inside.</li>
            <li>Simple to use, takes up little space for it&#x27;s size and is a great value for the price.</li>
            <li>It is so much nicer to do it with an actual light</li>
            <li>My only problem with this mirror is that is HUGE and takes up too much room on my vanity.  </li>
            <li>It can&#x27;t be used even after many tries.</li>
            <li>know some people with glasses have commented on mirrors saying they are no use, but I&#x27;ve had glasses practically my whole life, and I think this mirror does the job.</li>
            <li>(I think it really depends on your eyesight).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>And for what the product does, I would say this mirror is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>The reason it didn&#x27;t get a five star rating is the mirror is very touchy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not really a problem more of an annoyance.</li>
            <li>I tried it for one day and decided it was too much a hassel to hold it and get ready and decided to return it.</li>
            <li>This has made applying makeup so much easier.</li>
            <li>Very chic look</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had Ott-lite products before and expected more.  </li>
            <li>I received this all ready to go, just pulled it out of the box and plugged it in.  </li>
            <li>The problem I have with it is that the whole thing has to stand erect or the mirror starts to tilt and does not stay in place.  </li>
            <li>Colors are totally a different color than with the light fixtures in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t put way too much on and walk into school looking like you&#x27;re caked in makeup.</li>
            <li>VERY noticeable.  </li>
            <li>HOWEVER, the magnification side of th mirror makes you feel like you&#x27;re high when you look into it!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how yellow the light was on</li>
            <li>I actually really like this lighted mirror</li>
            <li>I really wanted this mirror despite all the reviews stating that the mirror tilts on</li>
            <li>The whole thing is well made with exception of the magnifying mirror.</li>
            <li>The 10X light looked very yellow!</li>
            <li>Something internal shorted out and light stopped working.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sturdy and is very dependable.</li>
            <li>Paid too much money for this.</li>
            <li>Still using halogen desk lamp with it for extra light.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the changes for the different light settings (day,office,home...)</li>
            <li>Fast delivery as well.  </li>
            <li>And I like it so much</li>
            <li>It probably has something to do with age - we just don&#x27;t see as well without more light as we get older or at least, I don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Now in addition to the carnival mirror you actually have to be the &amp;#34;one handed makeup lady&amp;#34; at the fair as well because you&#x27;ll need the other hand to hold the mirror so you can put on your makeup.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easily adjustable and the color of the lights is very natural and not yellow tinted.</li>
            <li>I would send it back, but threw away the original packaging.  </li>
            <li>And the fact you can replace the bulbs when they burn out is a plus considering most of the other mirrors are thrown away when the lights die.  </li>
            <li>Plus has a normal wall outlet charger and not a cordless battery charger those are a pain!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this make-up mirror as I have been without one for two weeks after mine finally bit the dust.  </li>
            <li>I saw in previous posts that people had that problem too, but overall it is really nice and worth the money.</li>
            <li>Not as bright as I expected, and the mirror is somewhat loose at the swivel hinges, but otherwise it works as it should.</li>
            <li>I was really needing a new make-up mirror.  </li>
            <li>I would apply my makeup and then walk outside and all the colors looked too bold or just</li>
            <li>I mainly use this at night because thats when I have to go to work.</li>
            <li>I then went back on and luckily found this one.  </li>
            <li>I took off a star because I think the price point is a bit high.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product based on my g/f and her friend&#x27;s reaction.</li>
            <li>With all the others I had to be in a highly lit room or by a window, with this one I don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>they would send me just a new bulb and screws, but they sent me a whole new item.  </li>
            <li>I had an older makeup mirror that you could change the light to mimic outdoors, indoors, work and evening, but I never changed the setting because it was harder to see my results.  </li>
            <li>, I couldn&#x27;t really see clearly what I was doing when applying make-up.  </li>
            <li>I am SO glad I bought this and didn&#x27;t waste my money.</li>
            <li>Good, not great.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, it saves time and money to put the right amount of product on from the get-go instead of having to touch up makeup in various rooms or once you leave the house.</li>
            <li>Easy off/on switch and fold down, if desired, when not in use.</li>
            <li>It has a very nice, sturdy base and the mirror swivels easily to get to the magnification side.</li>
            <li>When I arrived to my new home I ordered another one.  </li>
            <li>The new mirror won&#x27;t stay upright; it falls into a horizontal position.  </li>
            <li>Shipped new in box, as described.</li>
            <li>Now I need a new switch and can not find one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definately going to be more careful what I order from amazon in the future.</li>
            <li>I do not even need to use the under cabinet light that I had installed prior to this mirror, for extra lighting.</li>
            <li>This light is amazing HOWEVER the fact that you have to rig it in order to get it to stay in place was disappointing.</li>
            <li>She uses two and places them right near the screw in the middle, which is the swivel point.</li>
            <li>Sits on an ottoman and tilts the mirror down slightly to get a good angle.  </li>
            <li>The magnified side of the mirror is completely UNUSABLE because the image is so distorted!</li>
            <li>I am a regular Amazon shopper and this is the first time I have been compelled to write a review.  </li>
            <li>my old make up mirror!</li>
            <li>I received this product earlier than promised and it was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>My husband had a genius idea and fixed this problem quickly with a piece of thick sticky-backed felt (the kind you stick to the bottom of chairs and other ornamental items to prevent floors and table tops from being scratched).</li>
            <li>Having experienced other magnified mirrors I was surprised how hard it is to look into this one.</li>
            <li>For being an Ott-lite, the light could be brighter, but the thing that kills this product is the 5x mirror - it is odd - no matter what distance I held my face, the image was distorted and very hard on my eyes - poor mirror design... - the whole product is a great idea because it is Ott-lite, but what a waste of production efforts with such a poor 5x mirror -- I&#x27;m sending it back and getting the Zadro SLV410 - which I have had the experience of using and loved it, and now love it even more having had this experience...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Makeup professionals will tell you that blending  your makeup is essential if you want to avoid a clown look, and this light lets me really see how  the makeup is blending with my skin so that I do not have lines where the makeup seems to abruptly stop.</li>
            <li>BUT, as a person who is prone to headaches, I&#x27;ve had absolutely no problem getting super close and putting on my eyeliner with a ton of precision on the magnified side, so</li>
            <li>This way I&#x27;m sure my makeup is right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update -- after using for several months, the tilt feature does tend to slide down on</li>
            <li>What I received was a flimsy, lightweight and cheap looking plastic mess.</li>
            <li>The mirror is nice enough, but overpriced and of pretty poor quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall it is built pretty cheap which is too bad because it looks nice.</li>
            <li>This is so bright, I can do my make up in a completely dark room and have my face look the same outside later that</li>
            <li>The unit itself was well made but too big to fit in the limited counter space in our powder room.  </li>
            <li>good, the only drawback is the mirror is a little loose</li>
            <li>The magnifying mirror is curved and it distorts the image in an odd way, unlike my last mirror which was optically much more clear.  </li>
            <li>Be smart and buy a different product or beware!!</li>
            <li>Finally a makeup mirror that is like pure daylight.</li>
            <li>but then all they did was take away from what little light was available.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I love the actual mirror and light with this product, my only complaint is similar to others, the mirror doesn&#x27;t stay put!</li>
            <li>-- of course if you&#x27;re too far away, the magnifier side WILL look distorted.  </li>
            <li>I can see the issue people had with the on/off button -- it sticks a bit, but so far hasn&#x27;t been an issue.  </li>
            <li>Shifted make-up session to 15 yr old daughter&#x27;s bedroom freeing up the bathroom counter in the process.      </li>
            <li>THIS FAR EXCEEDS MY EXPENTATIONS.</li>
            <li>I purchased this mirror last year and ready to replace it.  </li>
            <li>i do professional make up</li>
            <li>But has worked well so far.</li>
            <li>In conclusion, Ottlight makes a very inferior product and their customer service&#x27;s only job is to make you jump through hoops and hope you give up.  </li>
            <li>and she uses one of those soft headbands to keep mirror in place.</li>
            <li>does not stay in place unless you adjustment frequently.</li>
            <li>Had an old Jerdon for over 10 years, so will buy another.</li>
            <li>I like other reviews liked the lighted part and all I had to do to keep from moving was place a small makeup sponge to keep steady where I wanted.</li>
            <li>I bought it for the extra light my other mirrors dont have.</li>
            <li>My original one, purchased locally at Joann&#x27;s, was clear and sharp.  </li>
            <li>Need to get extremely close to mirror or your face is distorted like a fun house mirror.</li>
            <li>If it had a better design on the base it would be a great mirror, but for the price it is not worth it.</li>
            <li>The mirror is fine as is the lighting - only one setting - and the mirror tends to swivel down while I am using it</li>
            <li>When you look into the magnified side it is actually hard to see your face because it looks kind of foggy, not clear and up close.</li>
            <li>However, the magnifying side of the mirror can only be described as a fun house mirror with the image wide on top and bottom and narrow in the middle and if you moved it made you dizzy.  </li>
            <li>I ordered it, got it in &amp; set it up, WOW what a major difference.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this, but I ended up sending it back.  </li>
            <li>Last but not least.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had it a full month and already replacing a bulb, and they&#x27;re not cheap.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been so let down by the lighting of other table top mirrors.</li>
            <li>The only complaint that I have is the the mirror should be hinged tighter so that is stays where you position it better.</li>
            <li>heavy duty, SUPER \\&quot;regular\\&quot; mirror....</li>
            <li>Light is not very bright either.</li>
            <li>I put my other magnifier on it for higher magnification which is my preference at age 67.</li>
            <li>Next to natural sunlight</li>
            <li>Spent two months trying to find a mirror just like this not to mention reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>This purchase from Ken&#x27;s Sewing Center was absolutely a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li>I returned it and so far I haven&#x27;t received my money back.</li>
            <li>One thing that annoyed the heck out of me with this mirror is that it swivels, the mirror does not stay in place at all I literally had to take a cotton ball and wedge it at the top to keep it from moving,</li>
            <li>I own 2 makeup mirrors that are useless.</li>
            <li>I was never sure with my old mirror that I was getting it right.  </li>
            <li>I find it odd that they are aware of this problem, yet they are still producing these in this way.</li>
            <li>My dorm is dark, especially when I&#x27;m getting ready to go out at night, and now I don&#x27;t need to be worried about being accidentally heavy handed or of not knowing the true color of my makeup before I end up being photographed.</li>
            <li>My wife loves it because the lighting is so much brighter than other makeup mirrors.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the button to turn the light on doesn&#x27;t always work.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s white, doesn&#x27;t get burning hot during use, the shape is sleek, it folds all the way down</li>
            <li>While I think 10x is a bit too much, 5x is not large enough.</li>
            <li>After reading that other buyers had similar problems, it makes me wonder if there is a large batch of factory seconds out there that are being sold.  </li>
            <li>The mirror itself could be a little wider, as the width is lost due to having light bulbs on both sides</li>
            <li>First of all, I ordered solid black.</li>
            <li>I use both sides of the mirror - be warned, though, that the lighting definitely accentuates all of your features, and all of your facial &amp;#34;flaws&amp;#34;, so keep in mind that you don&#x27;t actually look like that to other people since you are normally in lower light - and my only problem is that if you flip it to the opposite side, then flip it back, the mirror will start to rotate down and you&#x27;ll have to either hold it in place or keep it at an angle above the axis.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately it arrived broken, but customer svc is great and I will receive the new one before I have to send the old one back.</li>
            <li>I bought this mirror because it had such great reviews but was disappointed and immediately returned it.</li>
            <li>The base is sturdy but that&#x27;s honestly the only positive thing I can say about this item.</li>
            <li>maybe a little too much.  </li>
            <li>After my failed attempt of tape inside of the light casing (near the middle screw), my daughter (the patience saint) used two q-tips.</li>

            <li> The magnified side is great, and the lighting is amazing.</li>
            <li> It is almost too bright.</li>

            <li> This is a nice product for aging adults with a diminishing eye site.</li>
            <li> it is nicely lit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It gives off alot of good, bright light.</li>
            <li> This is a NICE mirror, basically.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own while in use</li>
            <li> For the 23 days I used it, I liked it.</li>
            <li> Because I own Ott lights for my knitting, I thought I&#x27;d try this.</li>
            <li> The mirror no longer spins on its own yet still turns easily!</li>
            <li> I love the bright light on this mirror!</li>
            <li> Very bright mirror, large mirror too.</li>
            <li> The non-magnified side was fine, and the lighting was good, as are all the Ott-lite products I have used.  </li>
            <li> The light is so bright there is no way I will miss anything.</li>
            <li> So far this is the best!</li>
            <li> I found the light to be way to bright for applying makeup.</li>
            <li> She really liked the one she had and was pleased with the replacement.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best one I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen some reviewers say the light was too bright, which just kinda confuses me-</li>
            <li> After trying many different make-up mirrors, I&#x27;m delighted to say; this one is awesome.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, very bright light that is very close to daylight, and decent sized mirror with magnification as well....</li>
            <li> The old mirror was great and worked good for years.  </li>
            <li> I can wedge a piece of folded paper in the side to keep it in place, which is OK with me because the light is so good.</li>
            <li> The light is bright with mirrors on both sides love it.  </li>
            <li> Very happy, light is bright enough, matches my vanity desk.</li>
            <li> pretty great buy.</li>
            <li> I suppose I should have stuck with the tried and true ones, for as good as OTT lights are, this product is sub-par.</li>
            <li> Its very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light-weight and not a true glass mirror, but it&#x27;s a good size and meets her needs perfectly.</li>
            <li> The lighting is very bright and natural.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The light it gives off is VERY bright but also VERY neutral-toned.</li>
            <li> I liked the light</li>
            <li> Better then I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mirror.</li>
            <li> I think this is the next best thing.</li>
            <li> Glad</li>
            <li> Love this makeup mirror.</li>
            <li> She has the mirror on a dressing table and keeps her make-up in the top dresser drawer.  </li>
            <li> OUTSTANDING  </li>
            <li> , this mirror will help for sure.</li>
            <li> Tacky, cheaply made and not even good light.</li>
            <li> I have had many makeup mirrors over the years.  </li>
            <li> The magnified side does more distorting than magnifying.  </li>
            <li> there are better mirrors out there.</li>
            <li> One of the pictures had a reflection in the mirror which they tried to say was a crack, so more pictures.  </li>
            <li> After searching the net I found what I feel is the best makeup mirror I have ever had...</li>
            <li> but there should be some more tension</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Fantastic mirror!</li>
            <li> and I love how it swivels.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m able to see all the details of my face</li>
            <li> It was delivered to my house within the same week of ordering, and packaged perfectly.</li>
            <li> This mirror is substantially brighter and has a better magnifying side.</li>
            <li> and I love it so much more than I could&#x27;ve ever imagined</li>
            <li> The light is bright and fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if I am going to be able to use it or not.  </li>
            <li> Hoping I will be able to get used to it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it is a good mirror, the fact it is well lit makes it worth it.</li>
            <li> I must agree with most, the mirror does not stay put kept moving/rolling.</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror for a gift for my mother to replace a mirror I bought her many years ago.</li>
            <li> and I love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this makeup mirror.  </li>
            <li> I love this mirror.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup mirror.  </li>
            <li> Love this mirror.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Wanting something more inconspicuous</li>
            <li> I wish that I had an Ott light in the bathroom mirrors also!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I thought I would love this mirror.  </li>
            <li> This is a fantastic mirror for the price!</li>
            <li> It would have been a great mirror the way the lights worked, but the reflection was very distorted.  </li>
            <li> It is the perfect height for sitting at a regular chair and table.</li>
            <li> Intense bright natural lighting, so perfect for doing my makeup!</li>
            <li> the lighting its great i really recomended</li>
            <li> shape was just okay.</li>
            <li> is the best makeup mirror there is, especially for the woman who has aging eyes!</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> light works gets a bit warm</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this piece and how quickly it arrived.</li>
            <li> The light itself is nice - provides a good, true light for viewing.  </li>
            <li> Great light quality, love that it is adjustable (mirror can be moved higher or lower).</li>
            <li> This light is super bright, which I appreciate because i basically do my makeup in a cave.</li>
            <li> Light was good, but didn&#x27;t make up for the distortion, and I am quite surprised as it had good reviews.</li>
            <li> I feel confident that I look well put together when using this mirror, which is more and more important as years go by.</li>
            <li> Really loveeeeee the natural daylight mirror, it is perfect, except the mirror keeps moving on its own.</li>
            <li> Additionally, if you go to the Ott-lite website, it seems that these lights are not only beautiful, bright, and as close to daylight as you can imagine indoors, but they are also full spectrum lights....</li>
            <li> The mirror(s) are clear and the light is very bright.</li>
            <li> But its an easy fix and there are many ways to solve the issue (clip, rubber band etc.).</li>
            <li> I got this because I needed a brighter light, and bright it definitely is, like overwhelmingly bright.</li>
            <li> I love this light.</li>
            <li> Reminded her that normal vision is not magnified and nobody looks at her through that kind of a lens!    </li>
            <li> The most egregious feature of this mirror for me was the blinding light.  </li>
            <li> One of the lights needs a &amp;#34;tap &amp;#34; to light up most of the time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrific, and I&#x27;m very pleased with the bright lighting.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find a better light for the money.</li>
            <li> and I loved it so much I needed one for my dorm room as well</li>
            <li> The service was good and was here fast.</li>
            <li> The light is ok and the size of the mirror is fine for make-up.  </li>
            <li> The lighting is great -- it&#x27;s a nice clean, white light, unlike the yellowish light of most mirrors.</li>
            <li> The light on the left wasn&#x27;t very bright.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to find a 5x mirror, as most are 10x which is too strong for me.  </li>
            <li> Great light reflect natural color of complexion &amp; hair.</li>
            <li> The left one was working and it is nice \\&quot;clean\\&quot; bright light.</li>
            <li> The lighting is terrific, the appearence of the mirror is just beautiful.  </li>
            <li> Best price on Amazon, well below average retail price.</li>
            <li> Have had for 2 years and still working fine.</li>
            <li> I have used cheap 10X magnifying mirrors that functioned fine</li>
            <li> I think it may be a full-spectrum light.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s great - the magnifying mirror is such a help.  </li>
            <li> And its the kind of light that is kind of blue, not so flattering.</li>
            <li> Also made out of flimsy cheap plastic that feels really cheap.</li>
            <li> The on/off switch felt cheap</li>
            <li> and after I got my makeup on and saw what I looked like in the light of day</li>
            <li> The light hasn&#x27;t dulled.</li>
            <li> The mirror wouldn&#x27;t stay put, and the light was distracting rather than helpful.</li>
            <li> The light is a plastic, made in China POS.&lt;br /&gt;Buyer be warned if you&#x27;re looking for quality</li>
            <li> The only flaw is that the mirror won&#x27;t stay in place, I have to put a pencil to keep it in place, otherwise, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> This mirror is fantastic.</li>
            <li> The light is bright enough, unlike many make up mirrors out there</li>
            <li> The lighting on this mirror is clear and bright.  </li>
            <li> so I always have to have something between the mirror and light</li>
            <li> After 24 hours of owning this, my husband convinced me to return the mirror, calling it a cheap piece of plastic junk.</li>
            <li> The light is bright and mimics natural light, size is big enough to see your face and neck and magnifying side is very handy for me since my sight is not so good</li>
            <li> The light is wonderful on this mirror and makes me wonder how I got along without it in the past.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> but the &#x27;true&#x27; light is what I wanted.</li>
            <li> When you are satisfied with how you look up close and personal in your Ott-lite mirror (i.e. you&#x27;ve done all you can), you can be confident you look good to everyone with normal vision.</li>
            <li> It really does give me better light than led or incandescent.</li>
            <li> It is nothing like a dim Conair, it&#x27;s so much better, but don&#x27;t buy it if you don&#x27;t want to be able to see your face.  </li>
            <li> The light on this mirror is adequate but after a time, the mirror began to move while applying makeup.  </li>
            <li> and  the light is so bright that you can actually see what you are doing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love how the light panels on each side really let you get any details you might overlook otherwise.  </li>
            <li> It is well made and the light is so bright that you can actually see what you are doing.  </li>
            <li> so I would highly recommend it to anyone who needs more light when applying make-up</li>
            <li> Working well, lights are bright and she uses it regularly.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a pretty great mirror overall.</li>
            <li> Lighting is bright enough to do what you need to do.  </li>
            <li> I essentially wanted two things: bright, true-to-life colored lighting, and a design that wasn&#x27;t so hideous that I&#x27;d be embarrassed about leaving it out all the time.  </li>
            <li> and I think it was an overall good investment.</li>
            <li> This effect cannot be good over extended daily use.  </li>
            <li> I hope he never finds out how much I paid for it - thank god for Amazon&#x27;s free returns!</li>
            <li> am glad I found it for a good price through Amazon (half of the msrp)</li>
            <li> Other than that, I am very satisfied with this!</li>
            <li> The product arrived with the light in the right not working.  </li>
            <li> However, the mirror works well, the light is the right &amp;#34;color&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m not having the &amp;#34;auto flip&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This mirror is nice looking, perfect lighting for putting makeup on, and the magnification is just right, but I had to go through 2 other of the same mirror to get it right.  </li>
            <li> I experienced none of the problem&#x27;s other folks did.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like every other mag mirror I&#x27;ve ever used and works great.</li>
            <li> and I liked the weight of the product (heavy for a makeup mirror), but I am returning it because the mirror flips on its own.  </li>
            <li> Nice build quality, only one light setting,</li>
            <li> You may get lucky</li>
            <li> So far, I love this light.  </li>
            <li> I love the natural light effect it provides</li>
            <li> I can now put on my makeup without any worry because I can see so well and realize that it will look super wherever I go.</li>
            <li> Seems like it takes a minute or two before light is fully bright but small price to pay for such a great mirror.</li>
            <li> pros: light is strong, like the flip mirror where one side is normal and</li>
            <li> What I have found is that the reviews about the mirror itself were pretty accurate.  </li>
            <li> While this mirror does give true strong natural light, and the 5x side is plenty for applying all eye makeup but</li>
            <li> It is also easily mobile if she wants to take it somewhere else.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have bought this one first!</li>
            <li> The only thing better would be to have a full vanity set-up like theatre/opera/broadway stars do!</li>
            <li> The first day I used it the right light turned off on me.</li>
            <li> The light itself is super bright and shows every little detail of your face.  </li>
            <li> My old mirror quick working after many years</li>
            <li> I have very dim light in my bedroom, and no lighted makeup mirror I bought was ever bright enough.. until this one!</li>
            <li> This is a great mirror for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> They give a &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; light that will show whether colors and textures really go together - ever put on an outfit and then look at yourself in sunlight and realize that the colors you have on don&#x27;t go together at all?</li>
            <li> The lights were not as bright as I expected</li>
            <li> I had the oval Conair light before this one and found it was clunkier and took up too much counter space.  </li>
            <li> although much nicer to look at does not give me the light I exected.  </li>
            <li> but I enjoyed my old Clairol mirror with all</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Mirror looked like you are in a fun house at the carnival.  </li>
            <li> Simple and effective,</li>
            <li> It was so distorted, it reminded me of looking into a circus fun house mirror.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> After leaving my house one too many times thinking my makeup looked fabulous only to realize I looked like a clown in the daylight, I went out in search of a lighted makeup mirror.  </li>
            <li> The mirror rotates &amp; rarely stays in place.  </li>
            <li> I love my old lighted mirror because the magnifying side is just right.  </li>
            <li> I own other Ott light products that I use for reading and crafting.  </li>
            <li> Very nice looking &amp; heavy ....</li>
            <li> and I want it to look right</li>
            <li> I like this mirror because of the natural true light, and 2 sided magnification.</li>
            <li> It has a clean modern look.</li>
            <li> This mirror does exactly what the description says it will: show the true color of makeup and clothes and give an accurate picture of what makeup looks like in natural sunlight.</li>
            <li> The light is really blue and not flattering for makeup application and not even bright enough either.</li>
            <li> Looks nice, the bend to the mirror is strange but doesn&#x27;t  bother me.</li>
            <li> If you are flip flopping about the pricelet me add that I definitely think it was worth the extra money, as it seems to be a great quality mirror, and seems pretty durable.  </li>
            <li> Disapopointed, like the like itself, but the right hand side bulb quit after the first use.</li>
            <li> It was also delivered quickly and packaged very well.</li>
            <li> This mirror replaces an old Conair that just wasn&#x27;t bright enough.</li>
            <li> Great for people who either don&#x27;t want to shell out the money for a bigger vanity mirror, or who don&#x27;t have enough space for one and still want the quality a lighted mirror provides.</li>
            <li> A large rubber band around the top half is a quick, easy fix</li>
            <li> The size of the mirror itself is great too, as most of the smaller circular mirrors are just too small for</li>
            <li> I Love the light, but like every other review I read, it won&#x27;t stay where you position it.</li>
            <li> I reccomend this mirror to any woman who is serious about having her face look beautiful.</li>
            <li> I use it to shave and it has helped me greatly with getting all those hard to visualize beard hairs on the neck and elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> I am a professional makeup artist, and I highly recommend this mirror for anyone looking for better lighting and magnification when doing their makeup, tweezing eyebrows, etc.</li>
            <li> I bought my first one at Ross for my room</li>
            <li> I love this mirror, I can actually see my face</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it will do</li>
            <li> overall, glad I bought it, but it could use some design improvements.</li>
            <li> Be sure you want this exact magnification because it makes the mirror size too small for the position you will need to be in to be able to see ...  and the lights are not adjustable.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s settings way better and the big difference in price.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this light two times and each time it quits working before it is six months old.</li>
            <li> The first one came in with the mirror cracked, the second one had a strange magnification problem that seemed distorted, but I&#x27;m glad I tried again because this final mirror is great</li>
            <li> Also, the lights are hot.</li>
            <li> I definitely have owned better mirrors then this one</li>
            <li> Satisfied that it was recently purchased they then wanted pictures of the mirror with the electrical cord cut, which I sent.  </li>
            <li> The regular side wasn&#x27;t much better.  </li>
            <li> and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> I love the daylight spectrum bulbs in this mirror, but the actual mirror piece tilts/swivels and doesn&#x27;t click into place.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> Would not have bought it if I had seen it first.</li>
            <li> I have other Ott-Lite products and purchased this due to the excellent lighting.</li>
            <li> Well all I can say is that it seems like most magnified mirrors that I&#x27;ve ever seen in that if you don&#x27;t get close enough to it, you can get a funhouse effect.  </li>
            <li> at first when i received item, one bulb was out i contacted the company, i throught</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed for atop my vanity table.</li>
            <li> so I wanted something with bright, natural light and somewhat small.</li>
            <li> I do wish the revolving mirror had a little more friction so it would stay securely in one place and angle.</li>
            <li> Lights are great as her bedroom lighting is not good.  </li>
            <li> general construction is cheap.</li>
            <li> I have had many many make up mirrors, and was always disappointed with the light not being bright enough..</li>
            <li> No settings of any kind for position or .&lt;br /&gt;Was not worth the money to me.</li>
            <li> have noticed that very few \\&quot;made in China\\&quot; products are of good quality</li>
            <li> It is very steady with a sturdy stand.</li>
            <li> At first my mirror would stay in place but after a few months it just turns on its own.</li>
            <li> The button works very well, and the cord is more than long enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was well packed and although large, is not too large.  </li>
            <li> You have to press it a certain way to get it to turn on.</li>
            <li> We found that the magnification was too large and distorted the image.  </li>
            <li> I was tempted to leave it a lesser rating but everything else about it is fine.</li>
            <li> , I was hoping to get a &#x27;good&#x27; one but had no such luck, also when we swiveled the mirror we could hear a loose object inside.</li>
            <li> Simple to use, takes up little space for it&#x27;s size and is a great value for the price.</li>
            <li> It is so much nicer to do it with an actual light</li>
            <li> My only problem with this mirror is that is HUGE and takes up too much room on my vanity.  </li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t be used even after many tries.</li>
            <li> know some people with glasses have commented on mirrors saying they are no use, but I&#x27;ve had glasses practically my whole life, and I think this mirror does the job.</li>
            <li> (I think it really depends on your eyesight).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> And for what the product does, I would say this mirror is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> The reason it didn&#x27;t get a five star rating is the mirror is very touchy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really a problem more of an annoyance.</li>
            <li> I tried it for one day and decided it was too much a hassel to hold it and get ready and decided to return it.</li>
            <li> This has made applying makeup so much easier.</li>
            <li> Very chic look</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Ott-lite products before and expected more.  </li>
            <li> I received this all ready to go, just pulled it out of the box and plugged it in.  </li>
            <li> The problem I have with it is that the whole thing has to stand erect or the mirror starts to tilt and does not stay in place.  </li>
            <li> Colors are totally a different color than with the light fixtures in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t put way too much on and walk into school looking like you&#x27;re caked in makeup.</li>
            <li> VERY noticeable.  </li>
            <li> HOWEVER, the magnification side of th mirror makes you feel like you&#x27;re high when you look into it!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how yellow the light was on</li>
            <li> I actually really like this lighted mirror</li>
            <li> I really wanted this mirror despite all the reviews stating that the mirror tilts on</li>
            <li> The whole thing is well made with exception of the magnifying mirror.</li>
            <li> The 10X light looked very yellow!</li>
            <li> Something internal shorted out and light stopped working.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy and is very dependable.</li>
            <li> Paid too much money for this.</li>
            <li> Still using halogen desk lamp with it for extra light.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the changes for the different light settings (day,office,home...)</li>
            <li> Fast delivery as well.  </li>
            <li> And I like it so much</li>
            <li> It probably has something to do with age - we just don&#x27;t see as well without more light as we get older or at least, I don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Now in addition to the carnival mirror you actually have to be the &amp;#34;one handed makeup lady&amp;#34; at the fair as well because you&#x27;ll need the other hand to hold the mirror so you can put on your makeup.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easily adjustable and the color of the lights is very natural and not yellow tinted.</li>
            <li> I would send it back, but threw away the original packaging.  </li>
            <li> And the fact you can replace the bulbs when they burn out is a plus considering most of the other mirrors are thrown away when the lights die.  </li>
            <li> Plus has a normal wall outlet charger and not a cordless battery charger those are a pain!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this make-up mirror as I have been without one for two weeks after mine finally bit the dust.  </li>
            <li> I saw in previous posts that people had that problem too, but overall it is really nice and worth the money.</li>
            <li> Not as bright as I expected, and the mirror is somewhat loose at the swivel hinges, but otherwise it works as it should.</li>
            <li> I was really needing a new make-up mirror.  </li>
            <li> I would apply my makeup and then walk outside and all the colors looked too bold or just</li>
            <li> I mainly use this at night because thats when I have to go to work.</li>
            <li> I then went back on and luckily found this one.  </li>
            <li> I took off a star because I think the price point is a bit high.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product based on my g/f and her friend&#x27;s reaction.</li>
            <li> With all the others I had to be in a highly lit room or by a window, with this one I don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> they would send me just a new bulb and screws, but they sent me a whole new item.  </li>
            <li> I had an older makeup mirror that you could change the light to mimic outdoors, indoors, work and evening, but I never changed the setting because it was harder to see my results.  </li>
            <li> , I couldn&#x27;t really see clearly what I was doing when applying make-up.  </li>
            <li> I am SO glad I bought this and didn&#x27;t waste my money.</li>
            <li> Good, not great.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, it saves time and money to put the right amount of product on from the get-go instead of having to touch up makeup in various rooms or once you leave the house.</li>
            <li> Easy off/on switch and fold down, if desired, when not in use.</li>
            <li> It has a very nice, sturdy base and the mirror swivels easily to get to the magnification side.</li>
            <li> When I arrived to my new home I ordered another one.  </li>
            <li> The new mirror won&#x27;t stay upright; it falls into a horizontal position.  </li>
            <li> Shipped new in box, as described.</li>
            <li> Now I need a new switch and can not find one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definately going to be more careful what I order from amazon in the future.</li>
            <li> I do not even need to use the under cabinet light that I had installed prior to this mirror, for extra lighting.</li>
            <li> This light is amazing HOWEVER the fact that you have to rig it in order to get it to stay in place was disappointing.</li>
            <li> She uses two and places them right near the screw in the middle, which is the swivel point.</li>
            <li> Sits on an ottoman and tilts the mirror down slightly to get a good angle.  </li>
            <li> The magnified side of the mirror is completely UNUSABLE because the image is so distorted!</li>
            <li> I am a regular Amazon shopper and this is the first time I have been compelled to write a review.  </li>
            <li> my old make up mirror!</li>
            <li> I received this product earlier than promised and it was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> My husband had a genius idea and fixed this problem quickly with a piece of thick sticky-backed felt (the kind you stick to the bottom of chairs and other ornamental items to prevent floors and table tops from being scratched).</li>
            <li> Having experienced other magnified mirrors I was surprised how hard it is to look into this one.</li>
            <li> For being an Ott-lite, the light could be brighter, but the thing that kills this product is the 5x mirror - it is odd - no matter what distance I held my face, the image was distorted and very hard on my eyes - poor mirror design... - the whole product is a great idea because it is Ott-lite, but what a waste of production efforts with such a poor 5x mirror -- I&#x27;m sending it back and getting the Zadro SLV410 - which I have had the experience of using and loved it, and now love it even more having had this experience...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Makeup professionals will tell you that blending  your makeup is essential if you want to avoid a clown look, and this light lets me really see how  the makeup is blending with my skin so that I do not have lines where the makeup seems to abruptly stop.</li>
            <li> BUT, as a person who is prone to headaches, I&#x27;ve had absolutely no problem getting super close and putting on my eyeliner with a ton of precision on the magnified side, so</li>
            <li> This way I&#x27;m sure my makeup is right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update -- after using for several months, the tilt feature does tend to slide down on</li>
            <li> What I received was a flimsy, lightweight and cheap looking plastic mess.</li>
            <li> The mirror is nice enough, but overpriced and of pretty poor quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall it is built pretty cheap which is too bad because it looks nice.</li>
            <li> This is so bright, I can do my make up in a completely dark room and have my face look the same outside later that</li>
            <li> The unit itself was well made but too big to fit in the limited counter space in our powder room.  </li>
            <li> good, the only drawback is the mirror is a little loose</li>
            <li> The magnifying mirror is curved and it distorts the image in an odd way, unlike my last mirror which was optically much more clear.  </li>
            <li> Be smart and buy a different product or beware!!</li>
            <li> Finally a makeup mirror that is like pure daylight.</li>
            <li> but then all they did was take away from what little light was available.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I love the actual mirror and light with this product, my only complaint is similar to others, the mirror doesn&#x27;t stay put!</li>
            <li> -- of course if you&#x27;re too far away, the magnifier side WILL look distorted.  </li>
            <li> I can see the issue people had with the on/off button -- it sticks a bit, but so far hasn&#x27;t been an issue.  </li>
            <li> Shifted make-up session to 15 yr old daughter&#x27;s bedroom freeing up the bathroom counter in the process.      </li>
            <li> THIS FAR EXCEEDS MY EXPENTATIONS.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mirror last year and ready to replace it.  </li>
            <li> i do professional make up</li>
            <li> But has worked well so far.</li>
            <li> In conclusion, Ottlight makes a very inferior product and their customer service&#x27;s only job is to make you jump through hoops and hope you give up.  </li>
            <li> and she uses one of those soft headbands to keep mirror in place.</li>
            <li> does not stay in place unless you adjustment frequently.</li>
            <li> Had an old Jerdon for over 10 years, so will buy another.</li>
            <li> I like other reviews liked the lighted part and all I had to do to keep from moving was place a small makeup sponge to keep steady where I wanted.</li>
            <li> I bought it for the extra light my other mirrors dont have.</li>
            <li> My original one, purchased locally at Joann&#x27;s, was clear and sharp.  </li>
            <li> Need to get extremely close to mirror or your face is distorted like a fun house mirror.</li>
            <li> If it had a better design on the base it would be a great mirror, but for the price it is not worth it.</li>
            <li> The mirror is fine as is the lighting - only one setting - and the mirror tends to swivel down while I am using it</li>
            <li> When you look into the magnified side it is actually hard to see your face because it looks kind of foggy, not clear and up close.</li>
            <li> However, the magnifying side of the mirror can only be described as a fun house mirror with the image wide on top and bottom and narrow in the middle and if you moved it made you dizzy.  </li>
            <li> I ordered it, got it in &amp; set it up, WOW what a major difference.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this, but I ended up sending it back.  </li>
            <li> Last but not least.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it a full month and already replacing a bulb, and they&#x27;re not cheap.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been so let down by the lighting of other table top mirrors.</li>
            <li> The only complaint that I have is the the mirror should be hinged tighter so that is stays where you position it better.</li>
            <li> heavy duty, SUPER \\&quot;regular\\&quot; mirror....</li>
            <li> Light is not very bright either.</li>
            <li> I put my other magnifier on it for higher magnification which is my preference at age 67.</li>
            <li> Next to natural sunlight</li>
            <li> Spent two months trying to find a mirror just like this not to mention reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> This purchase from Ken&#x27;s Sewing Center was absolutely a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> I returned it and so far I haven&#x27;t received my money back.</li>
            <li> One thing that annoyed the heck out of me with this mirror is that it swivels, the mirror does not stay in place at all I literally had to take a cotton ball and wedge it at the top to keep it from moving,</li>
            <li> I own 2 makeup mirrors that are useless.</li>
            <li> I was never sure with my old mirror that I was getting it right.  </li>
            <li> I find it odd that they are aware of this problem, yet they are still producing these in this way.</li>
            <li> My dorm is dark, especially when I&#x27;m getting ready to go out at night, and now I don&#x27;t need to be worried about being accidentally heavy handed or of not knowing the true color of my makeup before I end up being photographed.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it because the lighting is so much brighter than other makeup mirrors.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the button to turn the light on doesn&#x27;t always work.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s white, doesn&#x27;t get burning hot during use, the shape is sleek, it folds all the way down</li>
            <li> While I think 10x is a bit too much, 5x is not large enough.</li>
            <li> After reading that other buyers had similar problems, it makes me wonder if there is a large batch of factory seconds out there that are being sold.  </li>
            <li> The mirror itself could be a little wider, as the width is lost due to having light bulbs on both sides</li>
            <li> First of all, I ordered solid black.</li>
            <li> I use both sides of the mirror - be warned, though, that the lighting definitely accentuates all of your features, and all of your facial &amp;#34;flaws&amp;#34;, so keep in mind that you don&#x27;t actually look like that to other people since you are normally in lower light - and my only problem is that if you flip it to the opposite side, then flip it back, the mirror will start to rotate down and you&#x27;ll have to either hold it in place or keep it at an angle above the axis.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it arrived broken, but customer svc is great and I will receive the new one before I have to send the old one back.</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror because it had such great reviews but was disappointed and immediately returned it.</li>
            <li> The base is sturdy but that&#x27;s honestly the only positive thing I can say about this item.</li>
            <li> maybe a little too much.  </li>
            <li> After my failed attempt of tape inside of the light casing (near the middle screw), my daughter (the patience saint) used two q-tips.</li>
            <li> well, so it flips on its own, leaving it useless or extremely frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> mirror itself is clear, not distorted like some of the other reviews</li>
            <li> Folds flat for storage if needed.</li>
            <li> The box it came in was not packaged well and was not marked fragile.</li>
            <li> , I purchased the black model, and it looks very chic compared to other lighted mirrors I&#x27;ve seen, so that is a plus as well.  </li>
            <li> I was definitely in the &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34; for too long!  </li>
            <li> Sad that it arrived broken, but happy that the seller refunded the sale.</li>
            <li> This was easily remedied with a tiny piece of tape and is probably a fluke with just my mirror, but it could be inconvenient if you want to switch views regularly.</li>
            <li> The light is helpful but if the mirror doesn&#x27;t stay in the spot that i need it, it&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> Put all of the other reviewers&#x27; negative comments together and that describes this mirror exactly.  </li>
            <li> The magnified side is difficult to see clearly unless you look in one certain spot.  </li>
            <li> All the other ones were the same.  </li>
            <li> For people complaining about how mirror doesn&#x27;t stay put, I can only guess they have a 2 year-old flipping the mirror endlessly, as it moves when asked, but also stays in place with no problem.</li>
            <li> Upon arrival, the right bulb was loose and rattling around behind the lens.</li>
            <li> Also 5x is not really strong enough magnification and the mirror is smaller than pictured.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, all the other issues detract from the quality of the light.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like the swivel screws are a bit loose.</li>
            <li> mirror is loose and broke on me</li>
            <li> one tiny issue I had is that the mirror tends to tilt forward and then swing down and around so that the magnifying side (that I never use) is facing me.</li>
            <li> If your sitting down putting your makeup on you can&#x27;t tilt it back and have the mirror stay in place.  </li>
            <li> I was sent a black and white pattern.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a different mirror other than the typical Conair brand.</li>
            <li> Larger mirror than the oval and round light-up ones.</li>
            <li> At first it wasn&#x27;t often and it only moved a small amount, but it kept getting worse.  </li>
            <li> the mirror in the center does not stay put.  </li>
            <li> but it makes it harder to switch magnifications.</li>
            <li> I believe it is a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I REALLY DO NOT KNOW HOW TO KEEP THE MIRROR IN ONE</li>
            <li> I received my mirror faster than I expected, and was well packaged for delivery.</li>
            <li> For this price I expected a well made and sturdy mirror.</li>
            <li> and of little use due to the issue mentioned above.</li>
            <li> saw other comments about the mirror tilting, and I do agree it is a pain at times.</li>
            <li> the other 5x magnified  cons: the mirror doesn&#x27;t stay in place.</li>
            <li> I saw other reviews that said the mirror has no lock to keep it in place after adjusting the angle.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers that the mirror does not stay put - it keeps spinning.</li>
            <li> The magnified side is like looking into a funhouse mirror - extremely distorted.</li>
            <li> , it is Brighter than the Jerdon I had and conair and all the other ones also.</li>
            <li> It makes me think of the scene from Hollow Man!).</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers that the mirror does not stay in place, but tilts like it&#x27;s top-heavy, which is why I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I am not sure who could use the extra magnified portion.  </li>
            <li> I checked out other mirrors and even bought one at Harmon, and it was like a nightlite, so I returned it.  </li>
            <li> I have no problems with the mag mirror like other reviewers did.</li>
            <li> As the other posters stated, the mirror won&#x27;t stay in a vertical position -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for some time, the mirror now needs something of a plug to stop it from rotating to the other side.</li>
            <li> While I liked the lighting &amp; overall look of this item I have to say that I was VERY disappointed w/</li>
            <li> only complaint is that now (after about a year), the screws in the mirror seem to be coming loose and the mirror will tilt slightly when I&#x27;m putting on my makeup.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The mirror is not distorted (As other reviewers erroneously stated), and is of very high quality.</li>
            <li> The bulbs are a bit &amp;#34;bright&amp;#34; and often make it hard to see what you are actually doing.  </li>
            <li> That is the only complaint.</li>
            <li> Small mirror, mirror distorts to much and poor lighting.</li>
            <li> It kept flipping down if I wasn&#x27;t holding it.</li>
            <li> and if it came down to it</li>
            <li> I can tilt the mirror up or down as needed.</li>
            <li> So if you try to keep it at an angle to do your makeup, it pivots down.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not talented enough to hold the mirror with one hand and put on makeup with the other.</li>
            <li> I can only guess how badly my makeup was applied before i could really see what I was doing.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my mother and half of the lights did not work.</li>
            <li> , the mirror itself pivots from one side to the other, requiring regular adjusting during use - rather frustrating.</li>
            <li> I wish it were a little taller --</li>
            <li> This one seems a little stronger.  </li>
            <li> Even then, it&#x27;s a little blurry.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mirror for my daughter&#x27;s room as a present,  when the mirror came it was broken</li>
            <li> therefore I wasted the money.</li>
            <li> I can also hear tiny pieces bouncing inside and behind the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried several mirrors but the lighting was so poor</li>
            <li> With all the trouble returning this item I choose to keep it,and the crack doesn&#x27;t interfere with its use.</li>
            <li> Mirror too narrow...</li>
            <li> I can honestly say this is one of the worst purchases I have made on Amazon.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now with no complaints.</li>
            <li> I could not see them as I was literally blinded for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> The problem is that it&#x27;s not balanced, and not fit in there</li>
            <li> and I have tried a few.  </li>
            <li> I purchased two others from stores which I had to take back because of poor lighting.</li>
            <li> it was way to heavy to carry in my suitcase.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money to have to pay for the return shipping.</li>
            <li> I am infatuated with this light!&lt;br</li>
            <li> All I can say about that is thank God that I didn&#x27;t buy the expensive black and white one from the Ott-lite website.</li>
            <li> The only thing is the magnified side is horrible, it doesn&#x27;t magnify like other mirrors you can find that are so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> It sits neatly on my bedroom vanity and takes up very little space when not in use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However 3 stars were given because I received it with a small crack.</li>
            <li> There is definitely something wrong with the magnified mirror that causes it to distort the image.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pointless to try to even use it because your reflection is so out of focus.</li>
            <li> In the past I have always had mirrors that also had the side mirrors.  </li>
            <li> It is beyond me how such a well-known manufacturer would use this lousy mirror.</li>
            <li> Its pointless.</li>
            <li> my mascara (I use a small 10x for that)</li>
            <li> , so I had to find a new one, since it&#x27;s impossible to apply eye makeup while wearing reading glasses.</li>
            <li> I do need a magnifying mirror and this is a major disappointment.</li>
            <li> I tried several other models before I bought this one and was disappointed.</li>
            <li> THE MIRRORS LIGHTING IS TOO BRIGHT,SO IT IS HARD TO SEE YOURSELF AS YOU PUT ON YOUR MAKEUP.</li>
            <li> Seems that since she got the mirror for her birthday in late August, she&#x27;s applying eye make-up with a lighter hand...</li>
            <li> Some people complained about the brightness at the sides.</li>
            <li> This mirror has survived two years in college with a not so delicate daughter.  </li>
            <li> no more!</li>
            <li> ii mean</li>
            <li> It was switched on for less than 3 minutes and there were some weird noises from the lights of the makeup mirror</li>
            <li> The mirror is seriously distorted.</li>
            <li> Too bad - have to send it back.  </li>
            <li> Not good at all..</li>
            <li> How disappointing but not surprising as there was absolutely no padding or protection to the box -</li>
            <li> The lighting is not bright enought to put eye makeup on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very badly distorted, so much so that I can&#x27;t use that side at all.</li>
            <li> It has made things easier to see since I have terrible lighting in my apartment and never get my makeup right.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed after the product spoilt on the first use.</li>
            <li> I have ordered one for my daughter and hope the 5x on hers is NOT distorted as she has pretty awful vision without her glasses and needs the 5x.  </li>
            <li> 5 stars is that the swivel rod in the center is a bit loose and the mirror likes to swivel around by itself randomly while you&#x27;re doing your makeup (quite annoying and creepy..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying it is a bad product but not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> The magnification is almost nonexistent and the lighting is bad and hindered by the base of the bulbs showing through the clear side panels.</li>
            <li> I was tired of it turning on and off</li>
            <li> and I was tired of my makeup being spread all over the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> Arrived broken.</li>
            <li> It arrived broken.</li>
            <li> Broken when received.</li>
            <li> The hinges are poorly made.</li>
            <li> When it arrived today, the mirror was broken.  </li>
            <li> So I have to put something behind it to keep it from turning.  </li>
            <li> It makes it incredibly frustrating to use.  </li>
            <li> it was broken upon arrival.  </li>
            <li> why do you want a lighted makeup mirror to begin with if it&#x27;s not bright!?  </li>
            <li> My old mirror had terrible lighting</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 3 differnt ones , some were to small, out of focus or bad lighting.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after about three weeks, my power button wouldn&#x27;t hold in the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Probably an unlikely defect.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed with the magnify side...</li>
            <li> Just trying to pluck my eyebrows is difficult because it doesn&#x27;t magnify well at all.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with what i paid for it.  </li>
            <li> For the expensive price, this company has some quality control issues.  </li>
            <li> As for the magnifying mirror, it is blurry and difficult to focus in on.</li>
            <li> Was not impressed.</li>
            <li> The mirror does flip around randomly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You cannot go wrong with this, I made 5 of my friends purchase it</li>
            <li> Until then, I&#x27;d been doing my makeup in the bathroom mirror, which was very frustrating.</li>
            <li> There was a small chip on the side of the mirror, which is annoying for something in this price range.</li>
            <li> The mirror was a sad disappointment.</li>
            <li> And the other side (although I hate seeing my blackheads and out of place eyebrow hairs) is fantasic!</li>
            <li> The base was sturdy but the mirror was annoying and due to this I returned the mirror.</li>
            <li> This was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I have no problem paying return shipping if it&#x27;s my fault, but when the product is defective, that&#x27;s wrong!</li>
            <li> I was afraid I would be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had been having a problem with bad lighting in my house.</li>
            <li> bad buy</li>
            <li> bad:  </li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> The lighting in my house is atrocious, and I don&#x27;t have a window where I could conveniently sit to apply makeup every morning.  </li>
            <li> Try it - you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed with this mirror.</li>
            <li> I have to use q-tips to wedge between the mirror and base to keep the mirror at the angle I need.  </li>
            <li> It has a weighted base so it won&#x27;t tip over.</li>
            <li> It can get quite annoying at times.</li>
            <li> LIKE THE SIZE AND THE BASE OF THE MIRROR,</li>
            <li> The hinge between the base and the mirror/light frame will slacken over time and I have to readjust it, despite the fact it is supposed to lock.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I hate to think my make up has not looked</li>
            <li> This is a $55.00 piece of crap.</li>
            <li> This product was so very disappointing!</li>
            <li> and I would have to say that we were very disappointed with the magnification mirror.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> (As in it looks so awful that you want to go home and change clothes?)</li>
            <li> Purchased this because the lighting in my bedroom is awful</li>
            <li> But the worst part is the mirror won&#x27;t stay put.</li>
            <li> This one is undoubtedly the worst one I have ever encountered.  </li>
            <li> Called customer service, and they are terrible.  </li>
            <li> TERRIBLE.</li>
            <li> This is terrible!</li>
            <li> Very annoying.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I liked the light and I liked the weight of the product (heavy for a makeup mirror), but I am returning it because the mirror flips on its own.  The mirror is attached at the sides which causes issues.  The mirror flips at will and will not stay in the position that I have it in.</li>
            <li> This is a great mirror for everyday use.  Doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space.  Very good lighting!  Met expectations.</li>
            <li> I bought my first one at Ross for my room and I loved it so much I needed one for my dorm room as well</li>
            <li> Very disappointed after the product spoilt on the first use. It was switched on for less than 3 minutes and there were some weird noises from the lights of the makeup mirror and it just switched off. It can&#x27;t be used even after many tries.</li>
            <li> Better then I thought it would be. I used my last lighted mirror for 25 years. I was afraid I would be disappointed. I was not disappointed. I am very happy with this mirror purchase.</li>
            <li> Called my sister, who I bought this for, and she said she loved it.  Working well, lights are bright and she uses it regularly.</li>
            <li> It really does give me better light than led or incandescent. I use it for everything from eyebrow maintenance to makeup application.&lt;br /&gt;I know some people with glasses have commented on mirrors saying they are no use, but I&#x27;ve had glasses practically my whole life, and I think this mirror does the job. (I think it really depends on your eyesight).&lt;br /&gt;I saw other comments about the mirror tilting, and I do agree it is a pain at times. But its an easy fix and there are many ways to solve the issue (clip, rubber band etc.). Its really a great value for the price.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror, I can actually see my face and I can pluck my eyebrows - great light.  It is nothing like a dim Conair, it&#x27;s so much better, but don&#x27;t buy it if you don&#x27;t want to be able to see your face.  The mirror does slide back and forth, but just put a kleenex in there to stop it.  After I bought this, I immediately ordered another one to have as a spare and that was 2 years ago.  Thought I might gift, but I&#x27;m saving it for when I need it one day.  I have vision issues and I sit at the table and put a shoe box under it and it is the perfect height to put makeup on.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mirror for my daughter&#x27;s room as a present,  when the mirror came it was broken and I could not return the item because it was passed the date therefore I wasted the money.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mirror. I had been having a problem with bad lighting in my house. I would apply my makeup and then walk outside and all the colors looked too bold or just \\&quot;off.\\&quot; I knew that it was because of the lighting. So, I hopped online and saw all the good reviews about this product. This mirror does exactly what the description says it will: show the true color of makeup and clothes and give an accurate picture of what makeup looks like in natural sunlight. So, if you don&#x27;t have a window in your bedroom or wherever you do your makeup, this would be an excellent product to try. It will help you apply the right amount of product for that flawless face. And for what the product does, I would say this mirror is reasonably priced. In my opinion, it saves time and money to put the right amount of product on from the get-go instead of having to touch up makeup in various rooms or once you leave the house. Next to natural sunlight I think this is the next best thing. I am SO glad I bought this and didn&#x27;t waste my money. It does exactly what it says it will do and I think it was an overall good investment.</li>
            <li> pros: light is strong, like the flip mirror where one side is normal and the other 5x magnified  cons: the mirror doesn&#x27;t stay in place. I wish there was a way to lock the mirror in place after rotating between the two sides.   overall, glad I bought it, but it could use some design improvements.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it arrived broken, but customer svc is great and I will receive the new one before I have to send the old one back. Upon arrival, the right bulb was loose and rattling around behind the lens. The left one was working and it is nice \\&quot;clean\\&quot; bright light. I think it may be a full-spectrum light. It has a very nice, sturdy base and the mirror swivels easily to get to the magnification side. Larger mirror than the oval and round light-up ones. Folds flat for storage if needed. I saw other reviews that said the mirror has no lock to keep it in place after adjusting the angle. This is correct, but I have found that it doesn&#x27;t move after I&#x27;ve adjusted the angle. I can see maybe where over time it may though. I assume I can find replacement bulbs at Home Depot or somewhere similar if needed. I think it&#x27;s a pretty great mirror overall. I took off a star because I think the price point is a bit high.</li>
            <li> I replaced the touch on/off mirror I had with this one.  I was tired of it turning on and off when it wasn&#x27;t supposed to.  I read all the reviews and decided to try this model.  Glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;The mirror itself is clear, not distorted like some of the other reviews -- of course if you&#x27;re too far away, the magnifier side WILL look distorted.  Just move closer, it&#x27;s not rocket science.  I can see the issue people had with the on/off button -- it sticks a bit, but so far hasn&#x27;t been an issue.  The lighting is great -- it&#x27;s a nice clean, white light, unlike the yellowish light of most mirrors. It was well packed and although large, is not too large.  I would have given it 5 stars, but nothing is perfect.  I wish it were a little taller -- just an inch or two.  I use it on my dining room table for make up application and tweezing.  It works great for my needs. Try it - you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love this makeup mirror. I experienced none of the problem&#x27;s other folks did.</li>
            <li> I love this light. The reason it didn&#x27;t get a five star rating is the mirror is very touchy. It doesn&#x27;t like to stay where I want it. It&#x27;s not really a problem more of an annoyance.</li>
            <li> I use it to shave and it has helped me greatly with getting all those hard to visualize beard hairs on the neck and elsewhere.  I do wish the revolving mirror had a little more friction so it would stay securely in one place and angle.</li>
            <li> This makeup mirror has the best lighting I&#x27;ve found.  You won&#x27;t have a makeup line or orange face after using it.  What I have found is that the reviews about the mirror itself were pretty accurate.  The reflection on the magnified side does seem distorted.  Unfortunately, after about three weeks, my power button wouldn&#x27;t hold in the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; mode, so I had to return.  Probably an unlikely defect.  If they&#x27;d just fix the mirror, I&#x27;d reorder.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed.  It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Shifted make-up session to 15 yr old daughter&#x27;s bedroom freeing up the bathroom counter in the process.      Lights are great as her bedroom lighting is not good.  Seems that since she got the mirror for her birthday in late August, she&#x27;s applying eye make-up with a lighter hand...a definite plus.    When she was thrown by the magnification, cautioned her that the magnified side of the mirror was not intended to point out \\&quot;flaws\\&quot; but rather for people who wear glasses and need the magnification to compensate when applying eye make-up.  Reminded her that normal vision is not magnified and nobody looks at her through that kind of a lens!    She has the mirror on a dressing table and keeps her make-up in the top dresser drawer.  Sits on an ottoman and tilts the mirror down slightly to get a good angle.  Her friends like it and two of their moms have asked me about the mirror since they, too, would like to reclaim their family bathrooms.     It&#x27;s light-weight and not a true glass mirror, but it&#x27;s a good size and meets her needs perfectly. It is also easily mobile if she wants to take it somewhere else.</li>
            <li> Need to get extremely close to mirror or your face is distorted like a fun house mirror.</li>
            <li> I like this mirror because of the natural true light, and 2 sided magnification. Easy off/on switch and fold down, if desired, when not in use. I would recommend this Ott-light product to a friend.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item as a gift and was well received.</li>
            <li> Mirror wouldn&#x27;t stay level at all. It kept tilting back so I had to hold in in place to use it. I tried it for one day and decided it was too much a hassel to hold it and get ready and decided to return it. Overall it is built pretty cheap which is too bad because it looks nice. Crappy thing is I had to pay for return shipping. So I order a product, it doesn&#x27;t work properly, and now I lose money on it.  I&#x27;m definately going to be more careful what I order from amazon in the future. I have no problem paying return shipping if it&#x27;s my fault, but when the product is defective, that&#x27;s wrong!</li>
            <li> Its very cheaply made. I can also hear tiny pieces bouncing inside and behind the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It however, does what its supposed to do. The mirror finish and its rotation is acceptable. The lights on either side&lt;br /&gt;are fluorescent tubes. The chrome on plastic bezels looks cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that very few \\&quot;made in China\\&quot; products are of good quality, this is not one of them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Ott lights for working in fiber art for years. They give a &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; light that will show whether colors and textures really go together - ever put on an outfit and then look at yourself in sunlight and realize that the colors you have on don&#x27;t go together at all? (As in it looks so awful that you want to go home and change clothes?) Ott lights will never let that happen.  So what does this do for your skin and makeup?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makeup professionals will tell you that blending  your makeup is essential if you want to avoid a clown look, and this light lets me really see how  the makeup is blending with my skin so that I do not have lines where the makeup seems to abruptly stop. I was never sure with my old mirror that I was getting it right.  I feel confident that I look well put together when using this mirror, which is more and more important as years go by.</li>
            <li> OUTSTANDING  I WOULD RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT TO EVERYONE I KNOW WHO USES A MAKEUP MIRROR. THIS FAR EXCEEDS MY EXPENTATIONS. THANK YOU</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and well packaged. The lights didn&#x27;t work so I had to return it. The product is also bulky so a redesign would be good.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed.  Perfect</li>
            <li> This has made applying makeup so much easier. I tried several other models before I bought this one and was disappointed. The light is so bright there is no way I will miss anything. I wish I would have bought this one first!</li>
            <li> Be sure you want this exact magnification because it makes the mirror size too small for the position you will need to be in to be able to see ...  and the lights are not adjustable.  They are just way to bright for me.  I like that it seems like an upgrade sitting on my vanity but I enjoyed my old Clairol mirror with all it&#x27;s settings way better and the big difference in price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mirror last year and ready to replace it.  It has good lighting however it tilts backwards at the slighest touch.  I have to use q-tips to wedge between the mirror and base to keep the mirror at the angle I need.  If it had a better design on the base it would be a great mirror, but for the price it is not worth it.</li>
            <li> This light is super bright, which I appreciate because i basically do my makeup in a cave. Just be prepared to see how terrible your makeup actually looks when you use this mirror, although I appreciate the clarity because it has helped me perfect my technique. My only complaint is that the button to turn the light on doesn&#x27;t always work. You have to press it a certain way to get it to turn on.</li>
            <li> Disapopointed, like the like itself, but the right hand side bulb quit after the first use.</li>
            <li> I like the regulate side of the mirror but the magnified  side I seems distorted on the edge of the mirror. I also don&#x27;t like that you can see through where the bulbs are and see the bases of the bulbs.</li>
            <li> Looks nice... One of the lights did not work.. Returned..</li>
            <li> I have purchased this light two times and each time it quits working before it is six months old. Bummer!</li>
            <li> This was a birthday gift for my son&#x27;s girlfriend. He found it on-line and knew she would love it, which she did!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mirror! I have had mine for over a year now. I have tried others before such as Conair. So far this is the best! The lighting is amazing! I can put my make up on evenly, and not have to worry about looking like a patchworked quilt! I truly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The best ever! I&#x27;ve tried 3 differnt ones , some were to small, out of focus or bad lighting. This is PERFECT!!!</li>
            <li> Perfect lighting, Perfect size and it pivots which is a great feature. The magnifying mirror is great for doing eyebrows. It has a weighted base so it won&#x27;t tip over. It also is very good quality and well built. Very chic look so if you leave it out it doesn&#x27;t look out of place or gaudy.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product - accurate lighting - i do professional make up and it&#x27;s great - the magnifying mirror is such a help.  This product is jammin -</li>
            <li> I had a Clairol make-up mirror for over 30 years and was very happy with it.  It finally broke so I was looking for a replacement.  I tried several mirrors but the lighting was so poor, I couldn&#x27;t really see clearly what I was doing when applying make-up.  It probably has something to do with age - we just don&#x27;t see as well without more light as we get older or at least, I don&#x27;t.  This Mirror by Ott-lite is perfect.  It gives off great light and it&#x27;s a good looking mirror as well.  I&#x27;ve had this mirror for over a year now and I&#x27;m very pleased with it so I would highly recommend it to anyone who needs more light when applying make-up</li>
            <li> After reading the mostly good reviews this mirror had, I decided to get one. My old mirror had terrible lighting so I wanted something with bright, natural light and somewhat small. This definitley hits the mark. I spend good money on my make up and I want it to look right, this mirror will help for sure.</li>
            <li> The light on this mirror is adequate but after a time, the mirror began to move while applying makeup.  At first it wasn&#x27;t often and it only moved a small amount, but it kept getting worse.  Eventually, I had to buy a different brand.</li>
            <li> The mirror was a sad disappointment. The Magnifying Mirror \\&quot;side\\&quot; was curved and you appeared as you would expect to look if you were in a FunHouse. Not good at all.. Nice build quality, only one light setting, and of little use due to the issue mentioned above.</li>
            <li> Purchased this because the lighting in my bedroom is awful and I was tired of my makeup being spread all over the bathroom counter. It sits neatly on my bedroom vanity and takes up very little space when not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light it gives off is VERY bright but also VERY neutral-toned. I used to often get in the car and cringe in the mirror at the color difference between my face and neck after applying my makeup in the bathroom mirror... no more! I can see everything now and my makeup application skills have definitely improved accordingly. I highly recommend this mirror!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one tiny issue I had is that the mirror tends to tilt forward and then swing down and around so that the magnifying side (that I never use) is facing me. It&#x27;s like the swivel screws are a bit loose. This was easily remedied with a tiny piece of tape and is probably a fluke with just my mirror, but it could be inconvenient if you want to switch views regularly.</li>
            <li> The hinges do not hold so the mirror is constantly tipping forward. No settings of any kind for position or .&lt;br /&gt;Was not worth the money to me.</li>
            <li> the mirror is warped... doesn&#x27;t seem to be mirror material... like paper under glass.  Not impressed with the magnify side... bad buy</li>
            <li> This is a nice product for aging adults with a diminishing eye site. However 3 stars were given because I received it with a small crack. I didn&#x27;t notice this flaw until after the boxes had been thrown away. With all the trouble returning this item I choose to keep it,and the crack doesn&#x27;t interfere with its use.</li>
            <li> Very bright mirror, large mirror too. The only thing is the magnified side is horrible, it doesn&#x27;t magnify like other mirrors you can find that are so much cheaper. When you look into the magnified side it is actually hard to see your face because it looks kind of foggy, not clear and up close. Just trying to pluck my eyebrows is difficult because it doesn&#x27;t magnify well at all. I got this because I needed a brighter light, and bright it definitely is, like overwhelmingly bright. And its the kind of light that is kind of blue, not so flattering.</li>
            <li> Extremely bright! I do not even need to use the under cabinet light that I had installed prior to this mirror, for extra lighting.</li>
            <li> Arrived broken. The light is really blue and not flattering for makeup application and not even bright enough either. Also made out of flimsy cheap plastic that feels really cheap. But the worst part is the mirror won&#x27;t stay put. It keeps falling forward so I had to tape it to the frame to keep it in place. Tacky, cheaply made and not even good light.</li>
            <li> the mirror in the center does not stay put.  I can&#x27;t keep it in one place for me to use it properly.  Not impressed with what i paid for it.  The light is helpful but if the mirror doesn&#x27;t stay in the spot that i need it, it&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror because it had such great reviews but was disappointed and immediately returned it. The magnified side of the mirror is completely UNUSABLE because the image is so distorted! This was not just a matter of me having to get used to a 5x magnified mirror - I already had one but it was un-lit. There is definitely something wrong with the magnified mirror that causes it to distort the image. I would not recommend buying this mirror because of that.</li>
            <li> This mirror is nice looking, perfect lighting for putting makeup on, and the magnification is just right, but I had to go through 2 other of the same mirror to get it right.  That&#x27;s a lot!!  The third one was the charm.  The first one came in with the mirror cracked, the second one had a strange magnification problem that seemed distorted, but I&#x27;m glad I tried again because this final mirror is great and I&#x27;m really happy with it!</li>
            <li> The product arrived with the light in the right not working.  The light on the left wasn&#x27;t very bright.  The on/off switch felt cheap and I don&#x27;t think it would last.  Returned to Amazon.  I&#x27;ve had Ott-lite products before and expected more.  This was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> This is a great makeup mirror. It&#x27;s easily adjustable and the color of the lights is very natural and not yellow tinted.</li>
            <li> I already owned an Ott-lite makeup mirror and wanted another to travel with.  This one was a different color, but otherwise the same.  However comparing the two mirrors on the magnifying side was like night and day.  My original one, purchased locally at Joann&#x27;s, was clear and sharp.  The newer one purchased here was so distorted that there was no spot on my face that was in focus.  It reminded me of a carnival funhouse mirror.  After reading that other buyers had similar problems, it makes me wonder if there is a large batch of factory seconds out there that are being sold.  The non-magnified side was fine, and the lighting was good, as are all the Ott-lite products I have used.  I returned it as defective, and Amazon accepted the return with no problem whatsoever.</li>
            <li> We found that the magnification was too large and distorted the image.  The unit itself was well made but too big to fit in the limited counter space in our powder room.  We have returned the unit for refund..</li>
            <li> This product was a gift for my mother. I wanted to try a different mirror other than the typical Conair brand. It arrived broken. Contacted the seller and they immediately issued a refund and said to dispose of the item as we wished. They couldn&#x27;t fix it. Sad that it arrived broken, but happy that the seller refunded the sale.</li>
            <li> The 1x side was &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;. The lights were not as bright as I expected and after I got my makeup on and saw what I looked like in the light of day I went back in the house and took off my makeup! Another horror was the magnification side! What a joke...remember going to the carnival and those funhouse mirrors that made you look all distorted...there you go! That&#x27;s what this is like. Now in addition to the carnival mirror you actually have to be the &amp;#34;one handed makeup lady&amp;#34; at the fair as well because you&#x27;ll need the other hand to hold the mirror so you can put on your makeup.  It kept flipping down if I wasn&#x27;t holding it. I&#x27;m not talented enough to hold the mirror with one hand and put on makeup with the other. Are you?</li>
            <li> The light is wonderful on this mirror and makes me wonder how I got along without it in the past. I agree with the other reviewers that the mirror does not stay put - it keeps spinning. This is definitely a product defect but it is fixable. I just use the cord to keep the mirror from spinning. Another option to try is to wrap some string around the spindle to tighten it up. I didn&#x27;t try this trick but it should work.</li>
            <li> There was a small chip on the side of the mirror, which is annoying for something in this price range. Also, the lights are hot. However, the mirror works well, the light is the right &amp;#34;color&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m not having the &amp;#34;auto flip&amp;#34; problem others are having.</li>
            <li> Mirror too narrow... Had to return it.</li>
            <li> Really loveeeeee the natural daylight mirror, it is perfect, except the mirror keeps moving on its own. I saw in previous posts that people had that problem too, but overall it is really nice and worth the money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have good lighting in my makeup &amp;#34;corner&amp;#34;, so this mirror works perfectly for me. The light is bright and mimics natural light, size is big enough to see your face and neck and magnifying side is very handy for me since my sight is not so good anymore.&lt;br /&gt;great product, very happy with it.</li>
            <li> The lighting is poor, and it does not provide sufficient light for placing makup. It is necessary to use additional lighting.</li>
            <li> This product was so very disappointing! The magnified side is like looking into a funhouse mirror - extremely distorted. The mirror continually spins; it doesn&#x27;t stay in place. I found the light to be way to bright for applying makeup. I can honestly say this is one of the worst purchases I have made on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I bought this and I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now with no complaints. The mirror(s) are clear and the light is very bright.</li>
            <li> i did not like this the mirror kept spinning</li>
            <li> just too bright for me</li>
            <li> Worth every penny. I used it every morning for about two months now. It&#x27;s amazing. Makes makeup application perfect. I see colors the way they are meant to be seen. The light hasn&#x27;t dulled. The damask design is very elegant!</li>
            <li> I am a regular Amazon shopper and this is the first time I have been compelled to write a review.  I have had many makeup mirrors over the years.  This one is undoubtedly the worst one I have ever encountered.  Put all of the other reviewers&#x27; negative comments together and that describes this mirror exactly.  The most egregious feature of this mirror for me was the blinding light.  When I looked away from it to find the scattered makeup items on my table I could not see them as I was literally blinded for a few seconds. This effect cannot be good over extended daily use.  The magnified side does more distorting than magnifying.  I have used cheap 10X magnifying mirrors that functioned fine but this is unusable.  I had to send this back.</li>
            <li> This mirror is very bright. Almost too bright. But has worked well so far.</li>
            <li> It works and is very bright, I am so glad I have a makeup mirror now.  Looks nice, the bend to the mirror is strange but doesn&#x27;t  bother me.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this, but I ended up sending it back.  The mirror wouldn&#x27;t stay put, and the light was distracting rather than helpful.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to do my eye makeup and for that it&#x27;s great. The lighting is very bright and natural. One thing that annoyed the heck out of me with this mirror is that it swivels, the mirror does not stay in place at all I literally had to take a cotton ball and wedge it at the top to keep it from moving, As for the magnified side of the mirror it&#x27;s pointless to try to even use it because your reflection is so out of focus. I definitely have owned better mirrors then this one and if it came down to it I don&#x27;t think I would recommend this to anyone there are better mirrors out there.</li>
            <li> You may get lucky but then again you may have the experience I had with this mirror and Ottlight customer service.  After owning it a very short time the mirror wouldn&#x27;t turn on the on/off switch was defective. I called customer service and they insisted I send numerous pictures of the mirror and labels on the bottom and my receipt.  They lost the copy of the receipt which I had to send again. Satisfied that it was recently purchased they then wanted pictures of the mirror with the electrical cord cut, which I sent.  A replacement was finally sent.  However, the magnifying side of the mirror can only be described as a fun house mirror with the image wide on top and bottom and narrow in the middle and if you moved it made you dizzy.  The regular side wasn&#x27;t much better.  I immediately emailed customer service who again wanted pictures which I sent.  One of the pictures had a reflection in the mirror which they tried to say was a crack, so more pictures.  Then they wanted pictures taken a distance of 4\\&quot; from the mirror which I sent.  And they claimed the mirror was perfect. In conclusion, Ottlight makes a very inferior product and their customer service&#x27;s only job is to make you jump through hoops and hope you give up.  Be smart and buy a different product or beware!!</li>
            <li> The mirror is nice enough, but overpriced and of pretty poor quality.&lt;br /&gt;The mirror flips over between regular and magnifying. The problem is that it&#x27;s not balanced, and not fit in there well, so it flips on its own, leaving it useless or extremely frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;The general construction is cheap. Power button flimsy, etc. Giving it 2 stars cos it is nicely lit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend getting one or two ~5000K lamps and a regular, cheaper makeup mirror. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll be doing after returning this.</li>
            <li> My wife say&#x27;s she couldn&#x27;t be more happier with this make up mirror !&lt;br /&gt; It is well made and looks great on my desk and  the light is so bright that you can actually see what you are doing.&lt;br /&gt; No distortion , doesn&#x27;t flip around , just a great mirror to have.</li>
            <li> Just moved and gave the same makeup mirror to my sister.  The old mirror was great and worked good for years.  When I arrived to my new home I ordered another one.  The new mirror won&#x27;t stay upright; it falls into a horizontal position.  Also, the magnification mirror is distorted.  For the expensive price, this company has some quality control issues.  I would send it back, but threw away the original packaging.  My advice, don&#x27;t throw away any of the return packaging until you have used it for awhile.</li>
            <li> This mirror will have you in front for hours looking at every detail of your face. Buy with confidence. thank you</li>
            <li> Broken when received.</li>
            <li> For all the reviews about how the mirror turns at the slightest touch, my daughter has one and she uses one of those soft headbands to keep mirror in place. She just slides it over the very top of the mirror. She loves hers!</li>
            <li> Got this for my mom for Christmas and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> AWESOME BUY! Got this for my deployment so I could do my hair and face. I mainly use this at night because thats when I have to go to work. It gives off alot of good, bright light. And the other side (although I hate seeing my blackheads and out of place eyebrow hairs) is fantasic!</li>
            <li> After searching the net I found what I feel is the best makeup mirror I have ever had...and I have tried a few.  Lighting is bright enough to do what you need to do.  And the fact you can replace the bulbs when they burn out is a plus considering most of the other mirrors are thrown away when the lights die.  I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I love the daylight spectrum bulbs in this mirror, but the actual mirror piece tilts/swivels and doesn&#x27;t click into place. It can get quite annoying at times. A large rubber band around the top half is a quick, easy fix but it makes it harder to switch magnifications.</li>
            <li> I Love the light, but like every other review I read, it won&#x27;t stay where you position it. I finally folded a napkin and put it under the mirror and it fills the hole enough that the miror stays in place. but for over $100.00 for a make-up mirror, I shouldn&#x27;t have to do anythng to it, but plug it in.</li>
            <li> This is the best makeup mirror I&#x27;ve ever owned. My teenager keeps taking it out of my bathroom so I know what she&#x27;s getting for her birthday ;) I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the swivel or it moving unintentionally. It&#x27;s great. It was also delivered quickly and packaged very well.</li>
            <li> I received this all ready to go, just pulled it out of the box and plugged it in.  The light is great.  The problem I have with it is that the whole thing has to stand erect or the mirror starts to tilt and does not stay in place.  If your sitting down putting your makeup on you can&#x27;t tilt it back and have the mirror stay in place.  The mirror rotates inside the frame from regular to magnified.  I have wedged the piece of foam that came in the packaging to hold the mirror but there should be some more tension so it stays put.</li>
            <li> It came with one bulb not working. The light is a plastic, made in China POS.&lt;br /&gt;Buyer be warned if you&#x27;re looking for quality</li>
            <li> good, the only drawback is the mirror is a little loose does not stay in place unless you adjustment frequently.</li>
            <li> So far, I love this light.  I had the oval Conair light before this one and found it was clunkier and took up too much counter space.  This one tucks in against the wall and out of the way when I am not using it.  The light is very bright and I like that I can tilt the mirror up or down as needed.</li>
            <li> Mirror looked like you are in a fun house at the carnival.  Called customer service, and they are terrible.  Do not buy this!  I returned mine.</li>
            <li> I have had many many make up mirrors, and was always disappointed with the light not being bright enough..This mirror is amazing! I love it, it is Brighter than the Jerdon I had and conair and all the other ones also. I will always buy this brand from now on. the magnification is great, you can tilt it. Fantastic mirror!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  Light is awesome and shows everything......maybe a little too much.  :)  Great for putting on makeup though.  Colors are totally a different color than with the light fixtures in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> They gave me this shot broke and I&#x27;m passed ii mean I like it but it came broke and I feel like I payed a lot for this for it to come to me broke so I give this a 1 because I&#x27;m upset!</li>
            <li> The lighting is terrific, the appearence of the mirror is just beautiful.  The only flaw is that the mirror won&#x27;t stay in place, I have to put a pencil to keep it in place, otherwise, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Very nice looking &amp; heavy .... BUT the mirror flips around at will. Took it apart and tightened the inner screws .... and STILL kept flipping around. As for the magnifying mirror, it is blurry and difficult to focus in on. I believe it is a total waste of money. Had an old Jerdon for over 10 years, so will buy another. I suppose I should have stuck with the tried and true ones, for as good as OTT lights are, this product is sub-par.</li>
            <li> The mirror lights work great.  But, as others have posted, the reflection is distorted and will make you sea-sick.  I attached my 3X suction-cup mirror onto the mirror provided, and that works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So remember..... mirror is distorted and will make you sea-sick.</li>
            <li> While I liked the lighting &amp; overall look of this item I have to say that I was VERY disappointed w/ the magnified side of the mirror. It&#x27;s very badly distorted, so much so that I can&#x27;t use that side at all. Having experienced other magnified mirrors I was surprised how hard it is to look into this one.</li>
            <li> Takes up quite a bit of counter space.  One of the lights needs a &amp;#34;tap &amp;#34; to light up most of the time.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my mother and half of the lights did not work. Was not impressed.</li>
            <li> This mirror is fantastic. The light is great and I love how it swivels. I am a professional makeup artist, and I highly recommend this mirror for anyone looking for better lighting and magnification when doing their makeup, tweezing eyebrows, etc. The only thing better would be to have a full vanity set-up like theatre/opera/broadway stars do! I have very dim light in my bedroom, and no lighted makeup mirror I bought was ever bright enough.. until this one! The size of the mirror itself is great too, as most of the smaller circular mirrors are just too small for me.&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY reason I didn&#x27;t give this mirror 5 stars is that the swivel rod in the center is a bit loose and the mirror likes to swivel around by itself randomly while you&#x27;re doing your makeup (quite annoying and creepy.. It makes me think of the scene from Hollow Man!). My husband had a genius idea and fixed this problem quickly with a piece of thick sticky-backed felt (the kind you stick to the bottom of chairs and other ornamental items to prevent floors and table tops from being scratched). The mirror no longer spins on its own yet still turns easily!</li>
            <li> THE MIRRORS LIGHTING IS TOO BRIGHT,SO IT IS HARD TO SEE YOURSELF AS YOU PUT ON YOUR MAKEUP. LIKE THE SIZE AND THE BASE OF THE MIRROR, LIKE THE MAGNIFICATION.</li>
            <li> I love the actual mirror and light with this product, my only complaint is similar to others, the mirror doesn&#x27;t stay put! I tested this out at Bed Bath and Beyond and didn&#x27;t see the problem that others mentioned about the mirror moving around, so I purchased it. As soon as I opened the box and tested it out.. the mirror would adjust itself to whatever position. I now just lodge my eyelash curler into the open gap to keep it into place until I find some tape or make a latch. Besides that flaw, it&#x27;s a great mirror. I love the natural light effect it provides and I&#x27;m able to see all the details of my face so it&#x27;s easier to apply concealer and pluck my eye brows!</li>
            <li> This is the best lighted mirror on the market. I purchased two others from stores which I had to take back because of poor lighting. I can see everything with this mirror!  It was delivered to my house within the same week of ordering, and packaged perfectly. You will not be disappointed with this mirror.</li>
            <li> It ordered this for my mother, to replace one she had owned for years that had finally wore out. She really liked the one she had and was pleased with the replacement.</li>
            <li> This mirror replaces an old Conair that just wasn&#x27;t bright enough. This mirror is substantially brighter and has a better magnifying side. I agree with other reviewers that the mirror does not stay in place, but tilts like it&#x27;s top-heavy, which is why I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars. I can wedge a piece of folded paper in the side to keep it in place, which is OK with me because the light is so good.</li>
            <li> Very happy, light is bright enough, matches my vanity desk. Had it for 6 months now, zero complaints!!!  Spent two months trying to find a mirror just like this not to mention reasonably priced. Recommend to all! Plus has a normal wall outlet charger and not a cordless battery charger those are a pain!</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror for my dorm room and I love it so much more than I could&#x27;ve ever imagined I would. The lighting makes it so that my makeup is perfect every day. My dorm is dark, especially when I&#x27;m getting ready to go out at night, and now I don&#x27;t need to be worried about being accidentally heavy handed or of not knowing the true color of my makeup before I end up being photographed. Great for people who either don&#x27;t want to shell out the money for a bigger vanity mirror, or who don&#x27;t have enough space for one and still want the quality a lighted mirror provides.</li>
            <li> The light is bright and fantastic.  However, the case the mirror is in needs to tilt also.  I love my old lighted mirror because the magnifying side is just right.  This one seems a little stronger.  I need something between the magnifying side and the regular mirror.  Don&#x27;t know if I am going to be able to use it or not.  Hoping I will be able to get used to it.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this makeup mirror for traveling as it was advertised, however, upon receipt it was way to heavy to carry in my suitcase.</li>
            <li> I got this mirror looking for a well lit vanity mirror, and it has its strengths and weaknesses. The lighting is excellent, as good as the manufacturer states. The mirror itself could be a little wider, as the width is lost due to having light bulbs on both sides The hinges are poorly made. The point where the mirror itself pivots is cr*p and does not stay where I put it, and I have had to put a piece of cloth in between the mirror and frame to hold it stationary. The hinge between the base and the mirror/light frame will slacken over time and I have to readjust it, despite the fact it is supposed to lock.&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I found it for a good price through Amazon (half of the msrp) or else I would feel ripped off.&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is a good mirror, the fact it is well lit makes it worth it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this mirror after reading the reviews. I must agree with most, the mirror does not stay put kept moving/rolling. The lighted part was great-real bright. The base was sturdy but the mirror was annoying and due to this I returned the mirror. Great customer service and no hassle return! If the manufacturer can figure out to keep the mirror in place I would re-buy.</li>
            <li> I got this as a b-day gift for my g/f. Satisfactory shipping time, but best of all, outstanding product. The lighting is perfect she says. I highly recommend this product based on my g/f and her friend&#x27;s reaction.</li>
            <li> This is nice and bright. It is very steady with a sturdy stand. It has a clean modern look. I bought this mirror for a gift for my mother to replace a mirror I bought her many years ago. She loves it. Simple and effective,</li>
            <li> I received this as a Christmas present. Until then, I&#x27;d been doing my makeup in the bathroom mirror, which was very frustrating. It is so much nicer to do it with an actual light so you don&#x27;t put way too much on and walk into school looking like you&#x27;re caked in makeup. I use both sides of the mirror - be warned, though, that the lighting definitely accentuates all of your features, and all of your facial &amp;#34;flaws&amp;#34;, so keep in mind that you don&#x27;t actually look like that to other people since you are normally in lower light - and my only problem is that if you flip it to the opposite side, then flip it back, the mirror will start to rotate down and you&#x27;ll have to either hold it in place or keep it at an angle above the axis. Other than that, I am very satisfied with this!</li>
            <li> THE MIRROR WILL NOT STAY IN ONE PLACE THE LIGHTING IS PERFECT&lt;br /&gt;IT SPINS I REALLY DO NOT KNOW HOW TO KEEP THE MIRROR IN ONE&lt;br /&gt;PLACE IF YOU COULD REPLY IT WOULD HELP</li>
            <li> Good mirror for the cost.  The bulbs are a bit &amp;#34;bright&amp;#34; and often make it hard to see what you are actually doing.  I am not sure who could use the extra magnified portion.  I tried and could not use it to tweeze or apply make up.  Last but not least.  The mirror does move constantly and does not stay in position.  I had to take a piece of foam and put it between the mirror and swivel to keep it in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably would not have ordered again.</li>
            <li> The good:  The light is bright enough, unlike many make up mirrors out there (hello Conair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:  The mirror is seriously distorted. VERY noticeable.  Also 5x is not really strong enough magnification and the mirror is smaller than pictured. While I think 10x is a bit too much, 5x is not large enough.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this mirror</li>
            <li> The lighting on this mirror is clear and bright.  I checked out other mirrors and even bought one at Harmon, and it was like a nightlite, so I returned it.  All the other ones were the same.  So I went online and found this Ott lite.  It&#x27;s terrific, and I&#x27;m very pleased with the bright lighting.  The mirror does flip around randomly.  That is the only complaint.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these mirrors for my daughter and myself and I would have to say that we were very disappointed with the magnification mirror. It was so distorted, it reminded me of looking into a circus fun house mirror. The mirror also spins from side to side as you are using it and I constantly had to spin it back to where I wanted it.  I shipped both mirrors back and got a refund.</li>
            <li> This is a NICE mirror, basically.  GREAT ligting, heavy duty, SUPER \\&quot;regular\\&quot; mirror.... HOWEVER, the magnification side of th mirror makes you feel like you&#x27;re high when you look into it!  It&#x27;s WARPED beyond WARPED!  TERRIBLE. DO NOT BUY THIS MIRROR until they resolve this issue.  I now see I am not the only one who has posted about defect.</li>
            <li> I have been using lighted mirrors for over 50 years.  This is by far the best one I have ever used.  With all the others I had to be in a highly lit room or by a window, with this one I don&#x27;t.  Highly recommend.  Best price on Amazon, well below average retail price.</li>
            <li> I use this mirror daily and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that now (after about a year), the screws in the mirror seem to be coming loose and the mirror will tilt slightly when I&#x27;m putting on my makeup. It&#x27;s not the end of the world, but it is inconvinent. I need to just tighten the screws, but I keep forgetting.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup mirror.  I own other Ott light products that I use for reading and crafting.  I had an older makeup mirror that you could change the light to mimic outdoors, indoors, work and evening, but I never changed the setting because it was harder to see my results.  So, why bother with one with settings.  This way I&#x27;m sure my makeup is right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update -- after using for several months, the tilt feature does tend to slide down on it&#x27;s own.  There doesn&#x27;t seem to be any way to tighten.  A piece of well placed tape should do the trick.  Still like it overall though!</li>
            <li> My wife really loved it.  It is very bright and works perfectly for her.  She would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror. I had one just like it before someone dropped it in a move and broke it. This is a good price and a great product. I bought one for my mother too!</li>
            <li> After I researched several brands of make up mirrors...decided on Ott-lite.  I ordered it, got it in &amp; set it up, WOW what a major difference. Great light reflect natural color of complexion &amp; hair. I hate to think my make up has not looked it&#x27;s best, but know it will look great now.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup mirror.  It has made things easier to see since I have terrible lighting in my apartment and never get my makeup right.  Now I get my makeup perfect since I can see what I am doing.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror! The light is very bright which is what I wanted. Yes it gives your eyes that just stared at the sun feeling for a bit but the &#x27;true&#x27; light is what I wanted. I can&#x27;t believe how yellow the light was on my old make up mirror! This is so much better! I have no problems with the mag mirror like other reviewers did. It&#x27;s just like every other mag mirror I&#x27;ve ever used and works great.</li>
            <li> I actually really like this lighted mirror and yes, it doesn&#x27;t stay put so I always have to have something between the mirror and light so it doesn&#x27;t rotate.  The light itself is super bright and shows every little detail of your face.  I gave it 4 stars because the 5x is distorted, enough so that I don&#x27;t use it.  I don&#x27;t need it and find the 1x plenty close for me.  I have ordered one for my daughter and hope the 5x on hers is NOT distorted as she has pretty awful vision without her glasses and needs the 5x.  I will update this when it arrives.  Its possible I just got a bum 5x side.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it because the lighting is so much brighter than other makeup mirrors. Size of the mirror is good.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this make-up mirror as I have been without one for two weeks after mine finally bit the dust.  I was really needing a new make-up mirror.  When it arrived today, the mirror was broken.  How disappointing but not surprising as there was absolutely no padding or protection to the box - just a do not crush written on it.  As the delivery person handed it to me, I could hear chunks of things moving around inside the box and knew that if it was the mirror, which it turned out to be, it had been damaged.  Too bad - have to send it back.  I hope I do not have to pay for its return...</li>
            <li> This is a great mirror, it provides great views and the light is great for all times of the day.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this mirror despite all the reviews stating that the mirror tilts on it&#x27;s own while in use, I was hoping to get a &#x27;good&#x27; one but had no such luck, also when we swiveled the mirror we could hear a loose object inside. After 24 hours of owning this, my husband convinced me to return the mirror, calling it a cheap piece of plastic junk. I hope he never finds out how much I paid for it - thank god for Amazon&#x27;s free returns!</li>
            <li> Shipped new in box, as described. Not as bright as I expected, and the mirror is somewhat loose at the swivel hinges, but otherwise it works as it should.</li>
            <li> For being an Ott-lite, the light could be brighter, but the thing that kills this product is the 5x mirror - it is odd - no matter what distance I held my face, the image was distorted and very hard on my eyes - poor mirror design... - the whole product is a great idea because it is Ott-lite, but what a waste of production efforts with such a poor 5x mirror -- I&#x27;m sending it back and getting the Zadro SLV410 - which I have had the experience of using and loved it, and now love it even more having had this experience... also, Rialto makes an awesome collapsable travel makeup mirror with 1x and 5x sides.</li>
            <li> In the past I have always had mirrors that also had the side mirrors.  This mirror although much nicer to look at does not give me the light I exected.  I didn&#x27;t think I would miss the side mirrors that adjusted but I do....  I&#x27;m not saying it is a bad product but not what I expected.  If you don&#x27;t need a &amp;#34;daylight&amp;#34; that seems to be darker than that, you will like the attractive mirror.</li>
            <li> Would not have bought it if I had seen it first. The lighting is not bright enought to put eye makeup on. I have been using a makeup mirrors for years.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it! It&#x27;s worth the money. Can&#x27;t find a better light for the money. Gives You just what You need.</li>
            <li> This is too tall for the dresser I want to sit it on.  The magnifying mirror is curved and it distorts the image in an odd way, unlike my last mirror which was optically much more clear.  This limits the portion of the mirror you can view your face in.  As the other posters stated, the mirror won&#x27;t stay in a vertical position - it keeps tilting.  So I have to put something behind it to keep it from turning.  The light itself is nice - provides a good, true light for viewing.  Unfortunately, all the other issues detract from the quality of the light.  Too bad.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it a full month and already replacing a bulb, and they&#x27;re not cheap.  For the 23 days I used it, I liked it.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend this item for purchase unless you have very low expectations. Small mirror, mirror distorts to much and poor lighting.</li>
            <li> I have other Ott-Lite products and purchased this due to the excellent lighting. I am happy with that. The whole thing is well made with exception of the magnifying mirror. Magnifying mirrors are concave; they curve to the inside to work. I have used plenty of magnifying mirrors and have not seen one before like the Ott-Lite makeup mirror has. It contorts your image which causing your eyes to constantly refocus as you move. Yes, this can give you a headache. It is beyond me how such a well-known manufacturer would use this lousy mirror. I do need a magnifying mirror and this is a major disappointment. Because of this I cannot recommend it to others. I was tempted to leave it a lesser rating but everything else about it is fine.</li>
            <li> The mirror will not stay in one position, you have to hold it in place when you use it. The lighting is great just can&#x27;t keep it still.</li>
            <li> My only problem with this mirror is that is HUGE and takes up too much room on my vanity.  The quality of the light and mirror is excellent and it shows all the imperfections....I guess that isn&#x27;t a good thing!  Great for tweezing and makeup.</li>
            <li> Love this mirror. The daylight effect it gives off is perfect for makeup application. I was definitely in the &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34; for too long!  I received my mirror faster than I expected, and was well packaged for delivery. This purchase from Ken&#x27;s Sewing Center was absolutely a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> After leaving my house one too many times thinking my makeup looked fabulous only to realize I looked like a clown in the daylight, I went out in search of a lighted makeup mirror.  The lighting in my house is atrocious, and I don&#x27;t have a window where I could conveniently sit to apply makeup every morning.  When I began looking for a makeup mirror I essentially wanted two things: bright, true-to-life colored lighting, and a design that wasn&#x27;t so hideous that I&#x27;d be embarrassed about leaving it out all the time.  Well let me tell you, this mirror did not disappoint.  I&#x27;ve seen some reviewers say the light was too bright, which just kinda confuses me- why do you want a lighted makeup mirror to begin with if it&#x27;s not bright!?  The lights ARE very bright, although not blindingly so, and they wonderfully illuminate your face for precise makeup application.  Every morning I feel very confident that if the makeup looks good in this mirror, it&#x27;s gonna look good in any lighting I encounter throughout the day.  Additionally, if you go to the Ott-lite website, it seems that these lights are not only beautiful, bright, and as close to daylight as you can imagine indoors, but they are also full spectrum lights....goodbye wintertime blues!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wanting something more inconspicuous, I purchased the black model, and it looks very chic compared to other lighted mirrors I&#x27;ve seen, so that is a plus as well.  Another issue I saw reviewers mention was that the magnified mirror is warped.  Well all I can say is that it seems like most magnified mirrors that I&#x27;ve ever seen in that if you don&#x27;t get close enough to it, you can get a funhouse effect.  BUT, as a person who is prone to headaches, I&#x27;ve had absolutely no problem getting super close and putting on my eyeliner with a ton of precision on the magnified side, so I think the warped comments might be coming from people who aren&#x27;t used to using a magnified mirror for makeup application.  If you are flip flopping about the pricelet me add that I definitely think it was worth the extra money, as it seems to be a great quality mirror, and seems pretty durable.  Hopefully time will prove me correct in that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Excellent quality, very bright light that is very close to daylight, and decent sized mirror with magnification as well....pretty great buy.</li>
            <li> The mirror rotates &amp; rarely stays in place.  The magnified side is difficult to see clearly unless you look in one certain spot.  Even then, it&#x27;s a little blurry.</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror without the faintest idea of what an Ott Light was and what a great decision that was!! The lighting in this is White not yellow and I didn&#x27;t realize the big difference until I turned it on and also had my 10X mirror on at the same time. The 10X light looked very yellow! I can now put on my makeup without any worry because I can see so well and realize that it will look super wherever I go. I wish that I had an Ott light in the bathroom mirrors also! I reccomend this mirror to any woman who is serious about having her face look beautiful.</li>
            <li> This light is amazing HOWEVER the fact that you have to rig it in order to get it to stay in place was disappointing. All I can say about that is thank God that I didn&#x27;t buy the expensive black and white one from the Ott-lite website. After my failed attempt of tape inside of the light casing (near the middle screw), my daughter (the patience saint) used two q-tips. She uses two and places them right near the screw in the middle, which is the swivel point. I find it odd that they are aware of this problem, yet they are still producing these in this way.</li>
            <li> I own 2 makeup mirrors that are useless. Because I own Ott lights for my knitting, I thought I&#x27;d try this. I&#x27;m glad I did. Finally a makeup mirror that is like pure daylight. I can see perfectly and when I go outside to check my makeup, it&#x27;s perfect. Some people complained about the brightness at the sides. Just focus on your face and it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem. This mirror is my Holy Grail.</li>
            <li> My old mirror quick working after many years, so I had to find a new one, since it&#x27;s impossible to apply eye makeup while wearing reading glasses. The magnified side is great, and the lighting is amazing. I didn&#x27;t know what an Ott-lite was when I purchased it, and now I am looking at their reading lights to buy. I can only guess how badly my makeup was applied before i could really see what I was doing. Simple to use, takes up little space for it&#x27;s size and is a great value for the price. When you are satisfied with how you look up close and personal in your Ott-lite mirror (i.e. you&#x27;ve done all you can), you can be confident you look good to everyone with normal vision. For people complaining about how mirror doesn&#x27;t stay put, I can only guess they have a 2 year-old flipping the mirror endlessly, as it moves when asked, but also stays in place with no problem.</li>
            <li> It is almost too bright. Wish it had different settings for day/night.</li>
            <li> at first when i received item, one bulb was out i contacted the company, i throught they would send me just a new bulb and screws, but they sent me a whole new item.  i was very impressed will recommend this company to all my friends.</li>
            <li> This is a really great mirror. Exactly what I needed for atop my vanity table.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife for Christmas along with a 50 dollar gift card for Sephora. I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I thought I would love this mirror.  The light is ok and the size of the mirror is fine for make-up.  But the mirror doesn&#x27;t lock in place! So if you try to keep it at an angle to do your makeup, it pivots down.  It makes it incredibly frustrating to use.  I&#x27;ve looked it over and can&#x27;t see any way to tighten the mirror.</li>
            <li> Something internal shorted out and light stopped working. Had to trash way to soon after purchase. I would not buy another.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made! For this price I expected a well made and sturdy mirror. What I received was a flimsy, lightweight and cheap looking plastic mess. The magnification is almost nonexistent and the lighting is bad and hindered by the base of the bulbs showing through the clear side panels. The base is sturdy but that&#x27;s honestly the only positive thing I can say about this item. Had I finished remodeling my bedroom and opened it in time to return it I&#x27;d have sent it back and purchased something else.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic mirror for the price! I love how the light panels on each side really let you get any details you might overlook otherwise.  It&#x27;s sturdy and is very dependable. Very pleased with this piece and how quickly it arrived.</li>
            <li> This is terrible! First of all, I ordered solid black. I was sent a black and white pattern. Second, I was going to keep it anyway to avoid the hassle of returning it, but when I tried to use it, one of the light bulbs was already broken. This is a $55.00 piece of crap. Oh, and there wasn&#x27;t a packing slip enclosed. I cannot wait to get rid of this thing! Its pointless. I bought it for the extra light my other mirrors dont have.</li>
            <li> I love the bright light on this mirror! My daughter however, thinks it is too bright. The only complaint that I have is the the mirror should be hinged tighter so that is stays where you position it better.</li>
            <li> I was excited to find a 5x mirror, as most are 10x which is too strong for me.  It would have been a great mirror the way the lights worked, but the reflection was very distorted.  It was a waste of money to have to pay for the return shipping.</li>
            <li> While this mirror does give true strong natural light, and the 5x side is plenty for applying all eye makeup but my mascara (I use a small 10x for that), the mirror itself pivots from one side to the other, requiring regular adjusting during use - rather frustrating.</li>
            <li> I can not figure out how to keep the mirror from flipping. I have to stuff paper on the side of it. Paid too much money for this. I regret not sending it back.</li>
            <li> mirror will not stay in position at all. I&#x27;m returning mine. Light is not very bright either.</li>
            <li> I received this product earlier than promised and it was exactly as described.  I definitely recommend anyone purchasing this product!</li>
            <li> I am infatuated with this light!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s bright, it&#x27;s white, doesn&#x27;t get burning hot during use, the shape is sleek, it folds all the way down and there&#x27;s two mirrors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You cannot go wrong with this, I made 5 of my friends purchase it and they love it as well! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> I was given this mirror as gift from my husband. The on/off switch quit working within 5 months. I like other reviews liked the lighted part and all I had to do to keep from moving was place a small makeup sponge to keep steady where I wanted. I would remove sponge when locking in on regular mirror to magnified. Now I need a new switch and can not find one.</li>
            <li> At first my mirror would stay in place but after a few months it just turns on its own. Very annoying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the process of sending this mirror back as it arrived with the magnifying side cracked. I was very disappointed. The box it came in was not packaged well and was not marked fragile. I had to rate it a 1 star only because you can&#x27;t submit a review without a star.</li>
            <li> This is so bright, I can do my make up in a completely dark room and have my face look the same outside later that day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror is not distorted (As other reviewers erroneously stated), and is of very high quality. It is the perfect height for sitting at a regular chair and table. The button works very well, and the cord is more than long enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A++</li>
            <li> looks great on my stand. The lighting work good for putting on my make-up and doing my hair. Has the best look of all the ones I looked at. The service was good and was here fast.</li>
            <li> Intense bright natural lighting, so perfect for doing my makeup!</li>
            <li> This mirror has survived two years in college with a not so delicate daughter.  Great product</li>
            <li> Very good mirror, I was looking for a mirror that has a great you can see even what you dont want to see and the lighting its great i really recomended</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for some time, the mirror now needs something of a plug to stop it from rotating to the other side.</li>
            <li> I sent this back and got the Zadro.  Light was good, but didn&#x27;t make up for the distortion, and I am quite surprised as it had good reviews.</li>
            <li> it was broken upon arrival.  shape was just okay. i don&#x27;t know what else to say. goodbye. thank you. see ya.</li>
            <li> Good, not great. Still using halogen desk lamp with it for extra light. Used to that bright light.&lt;br /&gt;Nice to have angled mirror and sturdy stand. I put my other magnifier on it for higher magnification which is my preference at age 67.</li>
            <li> I had ordered 2 different makeup mirrors at 2 different times and both came to me defective. I returned the Conair and got the Jerdon. when that was defective I didn&#x27;t know what I was going to do.  I then went back on and luckily found this one.  I now feel that the others were blessings in disguise for me, for if they had not been defective I would never have found this one!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough about it.  It is well made and the light is so bright that you can actually see what you are doing.  It doesn&#x27;t have the changes for the different light settings (day,office,home...) but then all they did was take away from what little light was available.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best makeup mirror there is, especially for the woman who has aging eyes!</li>
            <li> The first day I used it the right light turned off on me. I returned it and so far I haven&#x27;t received my money back.</li>
            <li> mirror is loose and broke on me</li>
            <li> The light is bright with mirrors on both sides love it.  Fast delivery as well.  Mirror does not take up a lot of room.</li>
            <li> After trying many different make-up mirrors, I&#x27;m delighted to say; this one is awesome. I&#x27;ve been so let down by the lighting of other table top mirrors. This one is awesome! I love it.</li>
            <li> I needed something to assist with makeup so I don&#x27;t have to lean over all the time to reach the mirror... I&#x27;m practically blind - wear glasses/contacts... and have a bathroom that needs to be renovated with better lighting.. this saved the day until bathroom renovated in spring.  And I like it so much will continue to use it...</li>
            <li> Great light quality, love that it is adjustable (mirror can be moved higher or lower). Have had for 2 years and still working fine. Seems like it takes a minute or two before light is fully bright but small price to pay for such a great mirror.</li>
            <li> light works gets a bit warm</li>
            <li> The mirror is fine as is the lighting - only one setting - and the mirror tends to swivel down while I am using it so I have to hold it in place - don&#x27;t see a way to tighten it without taking it apart. Just FYI.</li>
