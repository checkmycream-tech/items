    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Very great product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best to switch your spots up from what my doctor told me, so I switch off on those areas.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent source of Progesterone, and works exceedingly well.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing for menopause symptoms !!</li>
            <li>It does the trick beautifully, according to the annual saliva test for hormone balance.</li>
            <li>It works great to get my progestion hormone in balance.</li>
            <li>I have used this every day and it works great.  </li>
            <li>Good product,</li>
            <li>I have used Bezwecken products since 1980 to reduce PMS, then to reduce peri-menpause symptoms, now I use it to keep my  bones healthy!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The post menopausal benefits of this product are amazing, but allow 5 to 8 weeks to begin feeling better . . .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give this product 10 stars or more</li>
            <li>If they take stuff like polysorbate 80 out of this formulation, then i&#x27;d like it a lot better.</li>
            <li>As another reviewer listed symptoms for estrogen dominance, I also suffered many symptoms.  </li>
            <li>but I do love this product</li>
            <li>,I feel so much better since I sarted using it.</li>
            <li>I feel more balanced when I use.</li>
            <li>I notice that my mood is better when I use it also.</li>
            <li>This product is a must for many women 30 and over.</li>
            <li>See askdrhelen.com for more specifics.</li>
            <li>She feels more balanced.)</li>
            <li>Need to try longer, I had hoped it would help me to sleep better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Progonol oral supplement for years with great success in controlling cramps and minimizing pain and hot flashes.</li>
            <li>The price is a bit high (no matter where you buy it), but I know it is good quality.</li>
            <li>There is still a substantial amount of cream available to use that way.  </li>
            <li>Awesome and exactly what I&#x27;d expected.</li>
            <li>it takes forever to rub in and it&#x27;s really greasy, whereas the oil rubs in very easily.</li>
            <li>I’ve tried many progesterone creams and I keep coming back to this because it’s truly effective.  </li>
            <li>While I loved the Ostaderm-V, this one I could only use about four times.</li>
            <li>This time there was a stronger alchohol smell, but it quickly disappears once applied.  </li>
            <li>it worth every dime.</li>
            <li>I gave it a full month but got no relief from hot flashes.</li>
            <li>When I received my latest tube of this cream, I noticed that a sticker with a slightly different list of ingredients was placed over the original list printed by the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t tried the new drops Bezwecken has on the market to replace the pellets, but the reviews I have read are that this new progesterone replacement is a ruse to get us to use, and therefore pay more.</li>
            <li>This has provided relief from many of them, improving my sleep, chest pains (not cardiac related, I checked it out with my doctor), cramps, and much more.  </li>
            <li>it stopped all my blood clots and they were frequent and huge.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;my hot flashes go away.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this brand of progesterone cream and it did nothing for me.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to any pre-menopausal women who are experiencing hot flashes.</li>
            <li>It helps to keep your skin and hair healthy as well as overall health and mood when our hormones start changing.</li>
            <li>Smells more like alcohol nothing different.</li>
            <li>However, I am still on my first tube of Bezwecken Progonol Cream.</li>
            <li>I can tell a difference when I do not use.&lt;br /&gt;I am much more emotional.</li>
            <li>(I can&#x27;t say if it would help in the long-term), so I read and saw it had alcohol listed as a top ingredient (I wish I would have read that prior to paying this much).</li>
            <li>Bezwecken makes very good products, they are price controlled, so difficult to get a deal anywhere.  </li>
            <li>plus, i really don&#x27;t like spreading the cream on my skin.</li>
            <li>It does increase my progesterone level in my bloodwork, so I know I am absorbing it well.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>I find it very helpful.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>This product has really helped my mood swings while going through the change.</li>
            <li>the liver filters out too much orally.  </li>
            <li>The cream is easy to use and it has cut down on my hot flashes (rather--power surges).  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know, but I do know that I feel better when i take the bezwecken oil, which uses the same progesterone as this cream, which I really don&#x27;t like for the reasons stated above.</li>
            <li>This product is brand new, so you can not have used it for 30 years!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>All natural product that really get the job done.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep trying, however, til I hit the right timing/amount combo, as this is one of the only solutions available to me (I had estrogen and progesterone + breast cancer 10 years ago so have to be careful in terms of what I take...</li>
            <li>* Dry eyes (I even had to get special eye drops!)&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I EVEN had to get special eye drops because my eyes were so dry!  </li>
            <li>but if they stop making the oil, then i&#x27;ll use the cream, because i really can&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t live with out it</li>
            <li>I had to use it regularly to keep my hot flashes under control.</li>
            <li>Since it seems to have to get into the system and you have to keep it using regularly for it to work , you may notice that it takes 3-5 days to get results when you first start using it.</li>
            <li>It has a nice subtle natural scent, which is a plus for me since I&#x27;m very sensitive to synthetic perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would also like to see some reviews that compare the old ProgonB to the new Progonol.  </li>
            <li>Are you perhaps referring to the previous pill format called ProgonB, which I also have used with fantastic results?</li>
            <li>It has really improved my quality of life going through &amp;#34;The Change.&amp;#34;  Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>She said that alcohol is an ingredient that is very drying and would do the opposite of help me.</li>
            <li>I put it in the cabinet for another time–perhaps when not so sensitive.</li>
            <li>Early onset of menstruation&lt;br /</li>
            <li>But so far have not noticed any difference.</li>
            <li>if I put in on in the middle of the day, I tend to have a problem falling asleep because I am not sleepy which can be a good thing when you are use to being tired all of the time.</li>
            <li>Sadly, doctors are not as helpful as a good Neuropathist.</li>
            <li>at the same time, I have gut-wrenching, utterly debilitating hot flashes and cramps).</li>
            <li>I am 72 years old and many people think I am at least 10 years younger.</li>
            <li>I used the ProgonB for several years and loved it and am sorry to see it gone.</li>
            <li>my gynecologist says that taking unapproved hormones is dangerous, but my homeopath says this is a very safe, natural product that&#x27;s safer than taking synthetic hormones approved by the FDA.</li>
            <li>The phytoprogesterones in Progonol provides my 57 year old body with just enough osteoblast boost to keep my bone density optimal.  </li>
            <li>I brought it to my OBGYN and, while she approved of the Ostaderm-V, was very against this one due to the alcohol.</li>
            <li>It is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that truly works and has the safety of being a topical, natural product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s expensive, too, but it works for me -- got rid of hot flashes, and i feel less tired, more energetic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost afraid to brag about how great this product is for fear that big pharma will pull it off the market like it has with other rival products.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very, very sorry to see the old ProgonB pills have been discontinued, and wonder if this new format will deliver similar positive results.&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who can compare the old pills to the new cream, please do.&lt;br /&gt;jamie</li>
            <li>I believe in this stuff whole heartily it is a life saver takes a little time but be patient</li>

            <li> the tube seems almost empty and I can&#x27;t squeeze anymore out</li>
            <li> This is prescribed by my doctor in addition to other hormones -</li>
            <li> There are other areas you can use it, like the chest etc.</li>
            <li> I use a small amount every morning and night, and I either rub it onto my wrist or my inner thigh.</li>
            <li> and just a little dab will do ya.</li>
            <li> Just a few differences to make me think, &amp;#34;hmmm?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Same as prescribed by my naturopathic doctor but much less expensive than buying through his practice.</li>
            <li> I am less edgy and cranky.</li>
            <li> Unlike another brand I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure who placed the sticker there (either the manufacturer or the seller)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they were discontinued, so I tried the cream with mixed results.</li>
            <li> * Decreased sex drive&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Sorry, I hate to be negative, but I was dissapointed  :(</li>
            <li> * Cold hands and feet&lt;br</li>
            <li> I always hated the pill.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It works great to get my progestion hormone in balance.</li>
            <li> This product is brand new, so you can not have used it for 30 years! Are you perhaps referring to the previous pill format called ProgonB, which I also have used with fantastic results? I&#x27;m very, very sorry to see the old ProgonB pills have been discontinued, and wonder if this new format will deliver similar positive results.&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who can compare the old pills to the new cream, please do.&lt;br /&gt;jamie</li>
            <li> I have used this every day and it works great.  Use am and pm and it helps&lt;br /&gt;my hot flashes go away.</li>
            <li> Bezwecken makes very good products, they are price controlled, so difficult to get a deal anywhere.  We like them and pay the peremium.</li>
            <li> Either I did&#x27;nt give it enough time or it just did&#x27;nt work for me. This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this brand of progesterone cream and it did nothing for me. Unlike another brand I have used in the past. I can also smell the alcohol when I apply the cream. Sorry, I hate to be negative, but I was dissapointed  :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give this product 10 stars or more if I could.&lt;br /&gt;The post menopausal benefits of this product are amazing, but allow 5 to 8 weeks to begin feeling better . . . and just a little dab will do ya.</li>
            <li> i bought progonB-L 4x instead of this becasue the liquid does not have some chemicals i don&#x27;t like, which this cream does have. plus, i really don&#x27;t like spreading the cream on my skin. it takes forever to rub in and it&#x27;s really greasy, whereas the oil rubs in very easily. and you only need two drops of the oil for 40 mg of progestrone vs 1/2 tsp of the cream for 40 mg, so the oil, for me, is easier to use. it&#x27;s expensive, too, but it works for me -- got rid of hot flashes, and i feel less tired, more energetic. my gynecologist says that taking unapproved hormones is dangerous, but my homeopath says this is a very safe, natural product that&#x27;s safer than taking synthetic hormones approved by the FDA. I don&#x27;t know, but I do know that I feel better when i take the bezwecken oil, which uses the same progesterone as this cream, which I really don&#x27;t like for the reasons stated above. but if they stop making the oil, then i&#x27;ll use the cream, because i really can&#x27;t live without this stuff. thank God for Bezwecken! If they take stuff like polysorbate 80 out of this formulation, then i&#x27;d like it a lot better.</li>
            <li> The phytoprogesterones in Progonol provides my 57 year old body with just enough osteoblast boost to keep my bone density optimal.  I have used Bezwecken products since 1980 to reduce PMS, then to reduce peri-menpause symptoms, now I use it to keep my  bones healthy!</li>
            <li> This is prescribed by my doctor in addition to other hormones - I hope I never have to be without it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing for menopause symptoms !! Couldn&#x27;t live with out it</li>
            <li> Prescribed by my naturopathic doctor for peri-menopausal symptoms.  As another reviewer listed symptoms for estrogen dominance, I also suffered many symptoms.  This has provided relief from many of them, improving my sleep, chest pains (not cardiac related, I checked it out with my doctor), cramps, and much more.  It has really improved my quality of life going through &amp;#34;The Change.&amp;#34;  Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I would also like to see some reviews that compare the old ProgonB to the new Progonol.  I used the ProgonB for several years and loved it and am sorry to see it gone.</li>
            <li> I got this by recommendation for vaginal atrophy, along with the Ostaderm-V. While I loved the Ostaderm-V, this one I could only use about four times. I noticed it burned a tad when I put it on (I can&#x27;t say if it would help in the long-term), so I read and saw it had alcohol listed as a top ingredient (I wish I would have read that prior to paying this much). I brought it to my OBGYN and, while she approved of the Ostaderm-V, was very against this one due to the alcohol. She said that alcohol is an ingredient that is very drying and would do the opposite of help me. No wonder! I put it in the cabinet for another time–perhaps when not so sensitive. :/</li>
            <li> I have used this cream off and on for several years. It does increase my progesterone level in my bloodwork, so I know I am absorbing it well. It has a nice subtle natural scent, which is a plus for me since I&#x27;m very sensitive to synthetic perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the tube seems almost empty and I can&#x27;t squeeze anymore out, I cut it open in the middle and keep the two pieces in a sealed plastic container or bag. There is still a substantial amount of cream available to use that way.  The price is a bit high (no matter where you buy it), but I know it is good quality.</li>
            <li> My naturopath selected this product for me after my breast cancer diagnosis in 2003. It does the trick beautifully, according to the annual saliva test for hormone balance. And it&#x27;s the only product that works for me, a must have!</li>
            <li> This product works well</li>
            <li> Same as prescribed by my naturopathic doctor but much less expensive than buying through his practice.</li>
            <li> Very great product it worth every dime. Am seeing results and I ordered it for costumers as well. All natural product that really get the job done.</li>
            <li> I tried this cream alone and also in conjunction with Estrovera.  I gave it a full month but got no relief from hot flashes.</li>
            <li> When I received my latest tube of this cream, I noticed that a sticker with a slightly different list of ingredients was placed over the original list printed by the manufacturer.  I&#x27;m not sure who placed the sticker there (either the manufacturer or the seller) however, an explanation by the seller might have been helpful.  I also noticed a slightly different odor when applying this cream, compared to my previous tube.  This time there was a stronger alchohol smell, but it quickly disappears once applied.  Just a few differences to make me think, &amp;#34;hmmm?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Progonol oral supplement for years with great success in controlling cramps and minimizing pain and hot flashes. Unfortunately they were discontinued, so I tried the cream with mixed results. I had anticipated faster relief, but no such luck. I&#x27;ll keep trying, however, til I hit the right timing/amount combo, as this is one of the only solutions available to me (I had estrogen and progesterone + breast cancer 10 years ago so have to be careful in terms of what I take...at the same time, I have gut-wrenching, utterly debilitating hot flashes and cramps).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the price but I do love this product,I feel so much better since I sarted using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost afraid to brag about how great this product is for fear that big pharma will pull it off the market like it has with other rival products.  The cream is easy to use and it has cut down on my hot flashes (rather--power surges).  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I feel more balanced when I use. Would recommend using in morning, if I put in on in the middle of the day, I tend to have a problem falling asleep because I am not sleepy which can be a good thing when you are use to being tired all of the time. Good product,</li>
            <li> I just wish it came in a bigger size!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried the new drops Bezwecken has on the market to replace the pellets, but the reviews I have read are that this new progesterone replacement is a ruse to get us to use, and therefore pay more. I use the cream all month long. On the last ten days of my &#x27;cycle&#x27; I use what is left of my stash of Progon B pellets. I won&#x27;t have a choice but to start using the liquid form once I run out. Either that or switch brands altogether.</li>
            <li> It really works. I had to use it regularly to keep my hot flashes under control. I realized it I couldn&#x27;t skip a day here and there and still do well. I have to use it twice a day on my wrists, back of knees, inside the bend in my arm, or inner upper arm. It&#x27;s best to switch your spots up from what my doctor told me, so I switch off on those areas. There are other areas you can use it, like the chest etc. but, I just use the spots above. Since it seems to have to get into the system and you have to keep it using regularly for it to work , you may notice that it takes 3-5 days to get results when you first start using it. So don&#x27;t give up too soon! I notice that my mood is better when I use it also. I am less edgy and cranky.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to any pre-menopausal women who are experiencing hot flashes. It is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that truly works and has the safety of being a topical, natural product.</li>
            <li> This product is a must for many women 30 and over. It helps to keep your skin and hair healthy as well as overall health and mood when our hormones start changing. See askdrhelen.com for more specifics.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for perhaps 30 years as an alternative to traditional hormone therapy.  I find it very helpful. I am 72 years old and many people think I am at least 10 years younger.</li>
            <li> I continue to order from this company over and over again.  Dependable and as promised!  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I immediately felt relief from estrogen dominance. I always hated the pill. Without pills, I could NOT THINK! I am a writer and now I can write!! I EVEN had to get special eye drops because my eyes were so dry!  (I gave some to my neighbor and she stopped yelling at her kids. She feels more balanced.) Symptoms of estrogen dominance can include:&lt;br /&gt;* Insomnia&lt;br /&gt;* Foggy thinking&lt;br /&gt;* Memory loss&lt;br /&gt;* Dry eyes (I even had to get special eye drops!)&lt;br /&gt;* Bloating&lt;br /&gt;* Depression: Anxiety and agitation&lt;br /&gt;* Fatigue&lt;br /&gt;* Allergies: asthma, hives, rashes, sinus congestion, sinus infections!&lt;br /&gt;* Mood swings&lt;br /&gt;* Cold hands and feet&lt;br /&gt;* Hair Loss&lt;br /&gt;* Headaches&lt;br /&gt;* Hypoglycemia&lt;br /&gt;* Early onset of menstruation&lt;br /&gt;* Magnesium deficiency&lt;br /&gt;* Irritability&lt;br /&gt;* Sluggish metabolism&lt;br /&gt;* Decreased sex drive&lt;br /&gt;* Thyroid dysfunction mimicking and/or causing: hypothyroidism&lt;br /&gt;* Zinc deficiency&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Estrogen dominance has also been linked to cancer! So, if you have symptoms try to see a Neuropathist. Sadly, doctors are not as helpful as a good Neuropathist.</li>
            <li> I’ve tried many progesterone creams and I keep coming back to this because it’s truly effective.  I feel the difference and I am no longer wandering from brand to brand.  This is the one for me.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 years now.  I have PCOS, so I do not get regular periods, this helps me get them regularly, without going on birth control pills.  I use a small amount every morning and night, and I either rub it onto my wrist or my inner thigh.</li>
            <li> Smells more like alcohol nothing different.</li>
            <li> Need to try longer, I had hoped it would help me to sleep better. But so far have not noticed any difference. However, I am still on my first tube of Bezwecken Progonol Cream.</li>
            <li> Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> This product has really helped my mood swings while going through the change. I can tell a difference when I do not use.&lt;br /&gt;I am much more emotional. Helps balance.</li>
            <li> Replacing hormones should ALWAYS be topical, not oral...the liver filters out too much orally.  This is an excellent source of Progesterone, and works exceedingly well.</li>
            <li> I believe in this stuff whole heartily it is a life saver takes a little time but be patient it stopped all my blood clots and they were frequent and huge.  I think it took between one to two months taking about 1ml Monday thru Saturday Off Sundays per doctors orders.</li>
            <li> Awesome and exactly what I&#x27;d expected. The service thoroughly exceeded my expectations!!</li>
