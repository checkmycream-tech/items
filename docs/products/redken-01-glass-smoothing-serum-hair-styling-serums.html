            <li> She gets quite dry in the winter.</li>
            <li> I apply it and my hair still is frizzy when I dry it.  </li>
            <li> It takes so little and makes such a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> This packaging is at least 6 years old.</li>
            <li> I use it on wet hair.</li>
            <li> JUST A DROP of this Serum rubbed into palm and applied to wet hair before styling -</li>
            <li> When I asked the stylist if there were anything that does the same thing (smooth and volumnize, she said no. :(</li>

            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It Is not too shiny and does not weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by another person who suffers from crazy static during winter.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my excessively curly haired dog.</li>
            <li> The technician really fried my hair and the brutal, dry winter air made it worse.</li>
            <li> Maybe I chose the wrong product, not sure.  </li>
            <li> Also, if you think your getting a deal buying online, your wrong.</li>
            <li> Sad to see that it has been discontinued.</li>

            <li> This stuff is amazing. It takes so little and makes such a difference in my hair. So soft and manageable! I cannot be without it!</li>
            <li> I am a hair stylist. I work in a Redken elite salon. If you want to by your products online you should look up diversion with salon products first. This packaging is at least 6 years old. It&#x27;s been discontinued for about 3 years now. If you liked glass redken has many other oils that you will love. Just check with your local redken salon. They can help you out. Also, if you think your getting a deal buying online, your wrong. I was extremely surprised at the high prices they are charging for these out of date products. They might not even the product the bottle says it is!!</li>

            <li> Had a perm wave done at a salon &amp; I&#x27;m lucky to have any hair left. The technician really fried my hair and the brutal, dry winter air made it worse. A different hair dresser recently told me about putting this in the ends only. I use it on wet hair. I also use it on my excessively curly haired dog. She gets quite dry in the winter. This stuff helps her fur stay soft. The product works great! I gave it 4 stars for the high price. However a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I may be in my sixties - but using Redken products - my hair doesn&#x27;t know it!  JUST A DROP of this Serum rubbed into palm and applied to wet hair before styling - completely banishes anything even remotely resembling frizzies.  LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product, I have used alot of different products but this one rules. Would not used anything else</li>

            <li> This was recommended to me by another person who suffers from crazy static during winter. This completely solve that for me. I have tried dozens of things that didn&#x27;t work; this did. Oh, and it only takes a drop; I&#x27;ve been nursing the same bottle for months.</li>
            <li> I apply this product after each time that I wash my hair in the shower usually 3 or 4 times per week and it keeps the hair looking good and manageable.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  Received it when the site said I would.</li>
            <li> the lady that cuts my hair used this after cutting my hair and I liked the way it made my hair lay.</li>
            <li> Love this product!! Sad to see that it has been discontinued.</li>

            <li> This was the first time I tried this product because others recommended it.  It did not do what I was hoping for.  I apply it and my hair still is frizzy when I dry it.  Maybe I chose the wrong product, not sure.  Thanks anyway.  Donna Rowe</li>
