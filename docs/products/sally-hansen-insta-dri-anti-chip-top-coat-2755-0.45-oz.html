            <li>my holy grail, dries in no time and great price.  </li>
            <li>But until that point, it&#x27;s a great topcoat.</li>
            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>so I am never without my favorite polish drier!!</li>
            <li>Very nice product, does what it says.</li>
            <li>Nice I think it is a very good product.</li>
            <li>This topcoat goes on nicely!</li>
            <li>This is one of the best top coats I have tried.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best top coat products.</li>

            <li>This is a great, great, great top coat.</li>
            <li>Great top coat!</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, though, I got this for like 4.50 at Target</li>
            <li>(I also got some good tips from product reviews)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good with no chips for a good week</li>
            <li>But when it does set...it sets good.</li>
            <li>But for the price it is a good product.  </li>
            <li>I use a mini fan and allow 3 mins drying time between coats and then give a good 7-10 mins after applying this topcoat and my nails never smear or smudge.</li>
            <li>I can still get a good 4-5 days out of my polish when I use this topcoat.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li>The gloss isnt superior</li>
            <li>My nails stay perfect for much longer now!!!</li>
            <li>This is one of the best topcoat I&#x27;ve used - it dries quickly (within 30 seconds) and gives your nails a shiny finish.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, many others, including salon brands, and this is what&#x27;s worked best for me</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!!!  </li>
            <li>really interesting - if you are in doubt, go on, it works really fine!!!</li>
            <li>Great top coat</li>
            <li>Great top coat</li>
            <li>I have used every nail product known to man, and this is the best instant drier you can buy at an amazing price!!</li>
            <li>got the package very early which made me happy; arrived nicely with no damage and works great!</li>
            <li>i am pleased with the product!</li>
            <li>But 30 minutes beats an hour (or more!)</li>
            <li>Now i paint them wait a bit and its like magic!</li>
            <li>I will be buying more!</li>
            <li>This top coat is a staple in my manicure box!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love nail art!</li>
            <li>Love this!  </li>
            <li>Looks AMAZING on</li>
            <li>Amazing- goof proof polish finish.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing..</li>
            <li>this is so amazing...</li>
            <li>This is amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>Truly amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this producto for years, and always has amazing result.</li>
            <li>Amazing product, nice price.</li>
            <li>I have always done my own nails &amp; this</li>
            <li>My finger nails look really shiny and great!</li>
            <li>Leaves a nice shine.</li>
            <li>This stuff is absolutely the best.  </li>
            <li>Use 2 coats of any kind of polish and for one of the coats lock in the polish meaning as you polish, glide the polish across the front of the nail to seal it in, this is also important.&lt;br /&gt;5.  </li>
            <li>Because I do my own mani/pedis</li>
            <li>This product does leave a nice shine on your nail polish.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s that good :-)</li>
            <li>This is remarkably effective stuff.  </li>
            <li>leaves a nice shine...</li>
            <li>all those nice things.</li>
            <li>kind of like the gel manicures at the salons.  </li>
            <li>Nice, glossy finish.</li>
            <li>Great product it dries nail polish quickly but doesn&#x27;t prevent the polish from chipping.</li>
            <li>This is great stuff, quick drying and a lot of shine</li>
            <li>Excellent fast drying top coat.  </li>
            <li>The best top coat and drys fast.</li>
            <li>My longest manicure has lasted 5 days with this on, so that&#x27;s pretty good if you ask me!</li>
            <li>I love this top coat!</li>
            <li>Love this Top Coat!</li>
            <li>Save it &amp; buy a better top coat!</li>
            <li>Having used probably dozens of &amp;#34;quick drying&amp;#34; polishes over the years, this one works by far the best.</li>
            <li>Before I was using Spoiled&#x27;s top coat and it took 2-3 coats to look this nice, and about 20x longer to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I LOVE, love, love the two products together!</li>
            <li>Love love love it!</li>
            <li>I love, love, LOVE this top coat!</li>
            <li>Works great, dries fast!</li>
            <li>It gives my manicure a beautiful shine and doesn&#x27;t cause shrinkage like Seche Vite&#x27;s fast drying top coat.</li>
            <li>Slept on a fresh manicure with this top coat and still shiny impeccable in the AM.</li>
            <li>It does a good job of drying quickly...</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this polish and plan on continuing to use it.</li>
            <li>Writing this now as quite impressed and may not have time to come back</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I use it on top of my essie top coat.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I use this more for the shine and protection of my nails than I do the quick-drying aspect.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I LOVE</li>
            <li>/&gt;Any suggestions for a better quick-dry top coat?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this Top Coat for years now and it serves me well.</li>
            <li>The directions say to wait 2 minutes after applying color then apply the top coat.</li>
            <li>I tried a lot of top coat</li>
            <li>Works better than anything I have ever tried, including the products my salon uses.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite top coat to date.</li>
            <li>I love the look of polished nails, whether it&#x27;s color or just shine.</li>
            <li>I do not recommend this top coat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been touching and tapping my nails trying to get them to show a ding</li>
            <li>I love it.    </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t using a top coat per se.</li>
            <li>I was just using Sally Hansen Diamond Strength hardener as a top coat</li>
            <li>I got on amazon and decided to give the Sally Hansen insta-dry anti-chip top coat a try.</li>
            <li>Top it off with the insta-dry anti-chip polish</li>
            <li>If you apply two layer of color and then apply the top coat</li>
            <li>what I&#x27;ve seen, this top coat doesn&#x27;t do what it says.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years and</li>
            <li>an i thought i&#x27;d give it a try... where has this top coat been all my life?!?!?!&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li>so i was able to, albeit with some difficulty, peel the polish off my nails rather than have to remove it with acetone.&lt;br /&gt;i plan on using this product with any and all</li>
            <li>I had never used a top coat before this, and I regret not finding this sooner.</li>
            <li>I also love that it doesn&#x27;t have a funky color to it.</li>
            <li>My nails are always painted and I have gone through so many products trying to find the \\&quot;one\\&quot;....</li>
            <li>I had doubts it would work, but am SO glad I gave it a shot.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I totally love this top coat.</li>
            <li>I tried the polish again without the top coat</li>
            <li>I love this top coat</li>
            <li>Definitely one of the best top coats I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>My favorite Sally Hansen top coat.  </li>
            <li>Looks like I&#x27;m better off without this top coat.</li>
            <li>More like 2-4 mins.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe l payed close to 10$ for essie \\&quot;no chip&#x27;s ahead top coat\\&quot; and it did nothing for me,</li>
            <li>Will by AGAIN!!!!:)</li>
            <li>This top coat does not keep polish on.</li>
            <li>I use this on top of my nail color and my polish still chips.</li>
            <li>But I still love to paint and care for my nails.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Today I purchased this top coat, Sally Hanson Insta-Dri and brought it home to use on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This top coat is holding up</li>
            <li>and I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Dries within seconds of application and protects nails from chipping and breaking for more than a week if you want.</li>
            <li>and I find Seche Vite to be better for me.</li>
            <li>Based on some reviews for this top coat I bought it.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely worth it!!</li>
            <li>This stuff is AMAZING - it dries incredibly quickly and leaves your nails shiny and chip-free for days.  </li>
            <li>Nice product, received quick.</li>
            <li>I mostly use &amp;#34;quick dry&amp;#34; nail polishes, but they STILL smudge easily</li>
            <li>this product is okay, not really the best.</li>
            <li>I can put this on at night, and in minutes I am in bed , asleep, and wake up with perfect nails because this stuff does such a fantastic job of drying your nails to prevent any damage to them while they are still in the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Great for polishing the nails of young girls who can&#x27;t sit still for more than about a minute.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for drying nail polish quickly--especially for brands like Essie polish that seem to take forever to dry!</li>
            <li>dries extremely quickly, has a very smooth feel, does not affect the nail polish underneath and protects from chipping like magic.</li>
            <li>ON CHEAP NAIL POLISH SOMETIMES GUARANTEE YOU WILL HAVE LOVE IT</li>
            <li>The drying time of this top coat is comparable to that of Seche Vite and the shine is pretty nice too.</li>
            <li>Best top coat, hands down.</li>
            <li>I love being able to function so quickly after painting my nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Tried all the high end top coats and by far this has been the best!</li>
            <li>It does take a little more than 30 seconds, but within 2 minutes it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li>think dry-kwik dries them faster, but makes them chip easily.</li>
            <li>If the price is too steep for you, I think you can easily skip it.</li>
            <li>all that great ( its not a proper top coat polish</li>
            <li>- it dries very quickly..  </li>
            <li>The best reason you need this now, if ONLY for this reason: You can sleep without smudging your fresh nails (fingers OR toes)</li>
            <li>Buff your nails first to ensure your nail bed is nice and smooth</li>
            <li>She always use it for her nails and manicure keeps fine for 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li>The Sally Hansen insta-dry chip top coat does just what it says it will do, dries quickly and keeps my nail polish from chipping.</li>
            <li>and if you don&#x27;t do too much laborous activity you will be able to go easily for 3-4 days, sometimes even 5!</li>
            <li>and it is a very pretty glossy top coat.  </li>
            <li>This works great, dries clear and quickly.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t put it on top of freshly painted polish however</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;ve found that it keeps the paint chip free longer, even after days of doing the dishes.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Fabulous product and a must-have for all nail buffs (pun intended).  </li>
            <li>Great for polishing toe nails in colder climates in the winter so that you can get your socks back on before your feet freeze!</li>
            <li>I got a gel nail kit and absolutely loved it, until I developed an allergic reaction to the polish.  </li>
            <li>Ok, so right now, I just put it on.</li>
            <li>it dries in 10 seconds its shiny it like gel polish in love right now</li>
            <li>Just some seconds and our nails are ready over a week!!!</li>
            <li>bought this particular product to dry my nails more quickly, and that&#x27;s what it does, so I&#x27;m happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li>But the shine is nice, and if you&#x27;re going for a top coat, the relatively quick dry time and the lack of shrinking make it a pretty good one.</li>
            <li>I am able to type this review without worrying about my nails getting messed up because it really works!</li>
            <li>but for the most part it holds pretty well.</li>
            <li>This top coat dries extremely fast!</li>
            <li>I had originally purchased this product because of the reviews that I read on Amazon</li>
            <li>I have never owned a top coat that didn&#x27;t chip within the first 24hrs.</li>
            <li>dry.&lt;br /&gt;Not a clean and neat finish.</li>
            <li>Goes on SO smoothly and evenly, dries quickly to a super-glossy shine.  </li>
            <li>Cheap, easy to find in person, and works wonders without all of the quirks of other popular top coats.</li>
            <li>Polish dries almost instantly and makes a nice super shiny top coat.  </li>
            <li>As for dry time, you can&#x27;t get better and at such a great cost!</li>
            <li>I reccomend you get this product right now!</li>
            <li>Water gets under the paint and it flakes right off in chunks!</li>
            <li>However, it is a very shiny top coat.</li>
            <li>I really want to test it :).</li>
            <li>but I will try to when I do a full mani.</li>
            <li>OK this dries really fast.  </li>
            <li>This is true.</li>
            <li>If it performed for the whole product use my rating would be better</li>
            <li>I just bought this polish for a good friend and my entire book club...</li>
            <li>Fast delivery which I love.</li>
            <li>Very shiny top coat and keeps my nails from chipping.</li>
            <li>top coat is very shiny, even after just one coat.</li>
            <li>take it to the nail salon when I get pedicures because it dries so much faster than the top coats at the salon.  </li>
            <li>It chips pretty easily for me.</li>
            <li>Other than that its a great product.</li>
            <li>Drys quick.</li>
            <li>U will just love it ur nail polish will last for a week or maybe more .</li>
            <li>Many people mistake my regular nail polish for a gel manicure when I use this top coat.</li>
            <li>relatively quickly-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve always eschewed, mainly because they&#x27;ve always smudged after I applied the top coat.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It dries quickly and keeps my nail polish from chipping.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It evens out your polish and gives you a super shiny finish.</li>
            <li>(Without, I&#x27;m lucky to get 24 hours before chips.)&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t seem to have any effect on how quickly my nails chipped either.</li>
            <li>I also love the high shine this polish gives.  </li>

            <li>but I normally do), added two coats of sparkle polish, and then (after waiting two minutes) put this top coat on.</li>
            <li>It does dry super quick, but it does not keep my nails from chipping any more than when I don&#x27;t use a top coat.</li>

            <li>It IS effective in drying your nails quickly, but it&#x27;s kind of pointless considering it makes the polish PEEL OFF pretty soon after.  </li>
            <li>This topcoat is amazing cause as soon as it dries it is seriously hard to the touch and has a nice finish</li>
            <li>But this product&#x27;s PRIMARY claim is INSTA-DRI and that it absolutely does.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently began doing my own manicures to save money.</li>

            <li>good test to see if your nails are truly dry is to VERY gently touch two of your nails together.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry so quick!!!</li>
            <li>if you do it the old fashioned way with normal top coat!</li>
            <li>I felt that though it worked incredibly well as a quick dry my nails would chip almost instantly</li>
            <li>Dries your nails super fast with no smudges!</li>
            <li>On the plus side, this is the best instant dry polish I have ever bought!!!  </li>

            <li>So if you do your nails right before bed, you will find dents in the morning.</li>
            <li>My sister recommended it to me and she was right.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product after reading the reviews at a local drug store and everything is true!!  </li>
            <li>After 4 days my polish is still on &amp; looking pretty good, considering I have an active lifestyle with a career and kids.</li>
            <li>Amazing product, nails are dry within seconds, life changer</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable for what it is, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It dries my nails very fast which I appreciate because my nails always get messed up as soon as I go to sleep.  </li>
            <li>Just get a dry quick top coat.</li>
            <li>Rock hard and great shine.</li>
            <li>Although this top coat dries very fast my nails still start chipping the next day.</li>
            <li>Sally Hansen Dries Instantly - Dri Anti chip top coat works</li>
            <li>My nails are so glossy and pretty that everyone keeps asking me where I got my nails done.  </li>
            <li>Dries fast!  </li>
            <li>I only apply one coat and make sure to not overlap brush strokes and it still smears the designs.  </li>
            <li>I love that this top coat actually dries instantly.  </li>
            <li>BUT this top coat has the dreaded \\&quot;peeling\\&quot; effect in that a day or two later some nail polish will just \\&quot;peel off\\&quot;!  </li>
            <li>This really works!  </li>
            <li>Dries as fast as it says, gives an amazing finish that looks and feels like salon quality, and makes my polish last much longer than otherwise.</li>
            <li>when you apply two coats, this top coat will later cause in your nail polish looking</li>
            <li>Make sure you wash your hands prior to manicure to remove all oils.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately my nail polish still chips and doesn&#x27;t stay perfect stay any longer than 4 days.</li>
            <li>Overall, this top coat does its job.</li>
            <li>then I waited the 2 minutes and applied this as the final top coat.</li>
            <li>I think it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I used this top coat for years, until last year when I picked up a bottle of Seche Vite.</li>
            <li>This polish performed exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>After the first time I bought this, I&#x27;ve kept it in stock all the time.  </li>
            <li>Vanity ranks quite low on my priority list most days.</li>
            <li>Seche Vite gives a higher shine, but causes the nail polish to shrink from the cuticle and nail tip.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the others, and this is the top coat I keep coming back to.</li>
            <li>A nail chipped, but still pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This really works!</li>
            <li>I must have 15 different top coat polishes.  </li>
            <li>will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>it happened with my first nail polish color.</li>
            <li>Instantly so I like it a bit better.</li>
            <li>constantly buying and giving away my bottle of this top coat.</li>
            <li>- I can now get through a whole week without having my polish chipped to the point of embarrassment!  </li>
            <li>I use it as my only top coat</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used two top coats - Seche Vite and this one</li>
            <li>However, to apply on top of a color it takes forever to dry, much longer than my old top coat.</li>
            <li>I need something that keeps my nail polish on longer and also dries quickly, along with a high gloss finish.  </li>
            <li>This is great for the instant dry feature but it does not prevent chipping.  </li>
            <li>during the first use, after 3-4 days i did notice the front edge of the nail showed some very subtle wear, like the polish was rubbed off, but that was due to the use of my hands, no chipping though, none of the usual bubbling on the sides of the nail, it was perfect, and especially great for feet that are in sandals all day&lt;</li>
            <li>I decided to give this a try because of the positive reviews and I must agree.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty ironic that the title of this product says Anti-chip.</li>
            <li>So I have to wait a long while to put on the top coat.</li>
            <li>Prior to finding this product, I&#x27;d gotten to where I assumed I&#x27;d never be able to keep up a decent manicure.  </li>
            <li>and I let the topcoat dry for 5-10 minutes just to be on the safe side.  </li>
            <li>I put this on as a top coat, and in about 10 minutes my nails are perfectly dry.</li>
            <li>Even better, 30 seconds after I&#x27;ve applied this stuff, my nails are dry to the touch.</li>
            <li>Then apply one layer of the top coat and it will dry to the touch in 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I just put it on my bare nails to get a nice shine and it looks terrific and it lasts almost two weeks.</li>
            <li>This item does work as far as drying your nails quickly and I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li>Love it so much, I can&#x27;t believe more salons do not carry this treasure - they can move the customers out faster than that painfully slow nail dryer that you have to sit through two cycles before you feel secure enough to grab something out of your purse.</li>
            <li>Not too certain</li>
            <li>Even after several days my fingernails look pretty nice especially for me.</li>
            <li>Not sure how this is not a problem for others, but I&#x27;ve tried this product twice and on both occasions my OPI nail polish (that on its own lasts 4-5 days minimum), with this top coat is getting peeled off the following day.</li>
            <li>This top coat does dry extremely fast.  </li>
            <li>top coat ever but does dry really fast.</li>
            <li>right after I take off my polish before I start the new manicure.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so hard to find a good one without having to spend a fortune.</li>
            <li>There is no false advertising here or exaggeration about it&#x27;s abilities.</li>
            <li>Amazing because you do not need to go to the nail Salam and waste money on someting that can doo at homeð</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I can never have too much of it.</li>
            <li>It protects your nail polish very well</li>
            <li>Dries your manicure so fast that I&#x27;m still amazed by it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>SO MUCH</li>
            <li>This stuff really works...</li>
            <li>It really is quick-dry, your polish color will be set within a minute.</li>
            <li>Would be MUCH appreciated!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It dries out fast, leaves my nails glamorously shiny and protects the polish from chipping too fast.</li>
            <li>I have been spending waay too much money at the salon doing gel nails (shellac) and also acrylics.  </li>
            <li>but it really does make your nails shine</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>so I used sinful colors too shine coat which makes it really glossy</li>
            <li>it really does the job.  </li>
            <li>I used another nail polish - not fast drying - and used this top coat after waiting a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine that it really works.</li>
            <li>This stuff really does dry my nails super quick.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t touch your hair, turn the pages of a book, use the computer -- all you can really do is just sit there and pray for the Nail Polish Goddess to finish her</li>
            <li>I love painting my nails and have been stuck on doing my own French manicure lately.</li>
            <li>Wash my hands really well with soap and water.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This stuff really does work.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>but I was really pushing it.</li>
            <li>Helps keep nail polish shiny, but as for it being anti-chip... not so much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really affordable too.</li>
            <li>I really does sry in about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>I swear this stuff really dries in seconds.</li>
            <li>Delivery is really fast.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be ready for it.</li>
            <li>This product really works!&lt;br</li>
            <li>highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>She says it really works.</li>
            <li>so manicures happen very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>I really like that about it.</li>
            <li>Dries really fast and prevent from chipping.</li>
            <li>This works really well.</li>
            <li>Ot dries the outer layer not the whole paint job fully through though.</li>
            <li>It works, i whole week withou a chip</li>
            <li>Dries fast.</li>
            <li>It leaves a strong, shiny coat that seems to dry ALL layers quickly; I&#x27;m always surprised by this fact.</li>
            <li>It does dry instantly and keeps my nails looking pretty nice.</li>
            <li>TO PROTECT MY MANICURE, I took off the gloves to find that my one day old manicure has chipped away!!!</li>
            <li>I will just have to continue my hunt to find a long lasting top coat!</li>
            <li>it was better than I expected!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have the time or patience to do my nails every other day which is almost what you have to do when using this top coat.  </li>
            <li>It works better than any other topcoat out there, no matter what the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works better than any other topcoat that I bought.</li>
            <li>I should have stuck with my other top coat (Revlon, nothing fancy at all).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll go to bed with nails that would end up with sheet marks if I were wearing any other brand of polish, but this one dries like magic.</li>
            <li>But l have  none of those problems no more with Sally Hansen Insta-Dri top coat!</li>
            <li>This top cost dries super fast and goes on thick.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is it doesn&#x27;t try super fast.</li>
            <li>This topcoat is super shiny, dries nails fast, &amp; helps polish last longer.</li>
            <li>Just love Sally Hansen Insta Dry, Chip top Coat, it makes my nail polish dry fast and last forever&amp;#62; I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>So after reading these reviews, I decided to give this product a try, and WOW, it really works!</li>
            <li>Otherwise, Sally Hansen Insta-Dry is a true miracle product, and I can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
            <li>Therefore, I have been doing my own testing trying to find the right combination that will allow me to have a natural manicure for at least 3-4 days and with this product I found it.  </li>
            <li>I put a light layer of the diamond strength hardener and let it dry</li>
            <li>I accidentally shattered the bottle of my previous top coat, so I decided to go for an upgrade when I replaced it.</li>
            <li>It dries polish quickly and last up to one week before it chips.</li>
            <li>Not a big problem since I go through it quickly.</li>
            <li>that the more expensive products that you assume will work better, i.e. OPI.</li>
            <li>on a french manicure where it&#x27;s very evident if it chips.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for anyone,  with any polish.</li>
            <li>But I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t tell you exactly how old my bottle was when it did, but it was under 2 years old and when the bottle got low it got goopy and much more likely to smudge the manicure.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a good, solid dry set; enough so that you can return amongst the living.  </li>
            <li>They MEAN &amp;#34;insta-dri&amp;#34; and love that!</li>
            <li>I actually use it alone sometimes for a professional clean look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;</li>
            <li>It really does dry quick.</li>
            <li>and I was surprised how fast it dries.  </li>
            <li>so I really dug in with another nail and got an indentation but was surprised not too smudgy.</li>
            <li>It does work on drying the nail polish faster, although I think it doesn&#x27;t help much on preventing early chipping.</li>
            <li>This top coat means I can move within a few minutes &amp; chips</li>
            <li>This product really does make your nails touch-dry very quickly, but only touch dry - any pressure and the polish underneath will crumple and slip.</li>
            <li>It really is dry to touch in 30 seconds, but I like to give it a full 2 or 3 minutes before doing anything.</li>
            <li>I absolutely can&#x27;t live without this product.  </li>
            <li>I use OPI&#x27;s quick dry spray on time and it does the trick.</li>
            <li>It does dry relatively quickly though.</li>
            <li>I already had a manicure that I did a few days ago with a cheapie clear top coat.</li>
            <li>It does dry the nails quickly, but it also chips the polish within hours, not days of wear.</li>
            <li>Made my polish dry quickly but kinda made it crack.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I plan to redo my manicure this weekend with all the good stuff-OPI no chip base coat, Sally Hansen polish and this top coat.</li>
            <li>It really does dry your nail polish very fast without smudging.    </li>
            <li>Most top coats dry on the surface only, leaving a wet, gloopy layer below it, so even when it&#x27;s dry to the touch</li>
            <li>and really does dry fast!</li>
            <li>and I touched the first nail, then the second, etc.</li>
            <li>Usually around 30 minutes is when it&#x27;s safe to start using your hands again.</li>
            <li>I do only minor touch ups using Sally Hansen complete salon manicure with the Insta-dri top coat, and I&#x27;m a busy mom of two young kids.</li>
            <li>As long as you follow the 2 minute rule on the box you are golden</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it for the first time tonight.</li>
            <li>But seems to go on thickly and chips pretty quickly!</li>
            <li>B00150LT40 Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat]] to cut down on the drying time, but</li>
            <li>you can see the new growth line and it does not look professional.  </li>
            <li>This is well worth the price seeing as before I would have to literally wait hours for my polish to fully dry or end up accidentally smudging them somehow.  </li>
            <li>But at least with this top coat I can type on my computer, use a gaming controller or do other simple things that I wasn&#x27;t able to do before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Small price to pay for high gloss, no shrinkage, and a mani that lasts for easily 4-5 days.</li>
            <li>Decent price, less than some, quick shipping and</li>
            <li>When I apply the Sally Hansen Insta Dry, my manicure sets right away</li>
            <li>This product takes more than 3 minutes to dry several different nail polishes.</li>
            <li>Not only does it dry any nail polish within minutes, it also protects your manicure better so that it will last for almost a week without chipping!  </li>
            <li>I really liked the shellac because it does last 10 days but unfortunately for me my nails grow too quickly so by day 5 or 6</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also not clear on how much faster it dries than regular nail polish - the other day I had to go without, and my Spoiled brand nail polish (which is only so-so) seemed to dry pretty quickly on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>This is the only clear nail polish that has ever really worked for me.</li>
            <li>Based on my wife&#x27;s reaction, she was surprised that it really did \\&quot;instantly</li>
            <li>It instantly dries your nails but makes them chip like so fast.</li>
            <li>If you are like me, a professional manicure destroyer, this will be a lifeline.</li>
            <li>I remove all the old polish with polish remover.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that it isn&#x27;t really 10 days antichip.</li>
            <li>It dries fast, but peel the following day.</li>
            <li>It seems to completely harden after 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>As of yet I haven&#x27;t kept the shine and no-chip feature for ten whole days . . .</li>
            <li>: It&#x27;s been three days and the only real chips I&#x27;ve had to my manicure</li>
            <li>: It&#x27;s been three days and the only real chips I&#x27;ve had to my manicure</li>
            <li>I apply it before my color coat is completely</li>
            <li>Looks great, but dries slow for being &amp;#34;instant.&amp;#34; Chips after just a few days.</li>
            <li>It dries very fast , give nails a lot of shine and keep the color intact very long</li>
            <li>I  mean it&#x27;s a top coat.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty dry.</li>
            <li>It does dry fast!</li>
            <li>Not only does it dry quickly</li>
            <li>This top coat actually dries ALL the way through in just a few minutes!</li>
            <li>But if you need to paint and run, as long as you are careful you will find this a very useful product.</li>
            <li>Use this top coat with Sally Hansen&#x27;s complete salon manicure polish, and your manicure will last at least a week.</li>
            <li>My only gripe is that while this top coat does \\&quot;set within 30 seconds\\&quot;, it doesn&#x27;t actually cure the polish until a few hours in.</li>
            <li>I thought it was me being over active the first time (washing hands frequently, household chores, etcetera)</li>
            <li>There are no instructions to say how long before it should be dry per going about normal activities (how I ended up here ;)).</li>
            <li>I live overseas, and it is about 13 euros a bottle (about $17.50 at current exchange rates.)</li>
            <li>I was sceptical about the &amp;#34;instant dry&amp;#34; thing, but it did dry quite fast, with 5-10 mins I didn&#x27;t have to be &amp;#34;careful&amp;#34; with my nails.</li>
            <li>It does dry adequately fast, but doesn&#x27;t fully settle for a bit.  </li>
            <li>When a friend does them and uses either nothing or Dry Kwik they seem to chip much faster.</li>
            <li>My nails really do already feel like they&#x27;ve been dry forever.</li>
            <li>You really have to wait 2-3 minuted before putting this on and then another minute before your nails are truly dry.</li>
            <li>It does dry your nails fast.</li>
            <li>Also, because the surface does dry so quickly, it takes a bit longer for the polish underneath to dry fully.</li>
            <li>It also last pretty long.</li>
            <li>It dried quickly and I must say it does make ur nail feel thicker.</li>
            <li>Dried quickly which is a plus when you paint your nails before bed.</li>
            <li>Drys fast if you just want to use it as a single layer coat.</li>
            <li>I was worried that you could only paint one coat of actual nail polish/color before using this top coat, but in reality I did two coats (pretty thick ones at that), waited the two minutes and boom, dry to the touch.  </li>
            <li>My biggest qualm with the whole process is waiting for everything to dry!</li>
            <li>It gives my nails a great shine and seriously holds up against chipping for at least 8 or 9 days (and I use and wash my hands a lot in my profession).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hard on my hands, and this is the only product I&#x27;ve found that can get my manicures to last more than 24 hrs.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why this product is sold in a clear bottle and the colored bottle above.</li>
            <li>It is clear, don&#x27;t let the red bottle fool you -</li>
            <li>I was really skeptical at first because I really didn&#x27;t think this was going to work, but it really does!</li>
            <li>For example, as far as I know, I only ordered one of these and received a quantity of four, and they cannot be returned.  </li>
            <li>I painted my nails barely 2-3 minutes ago</li>
            <li>I have not experienced a chipping effect, and I love how shiny it makes my nails look</li>
            <li>&amp; I frequently chip my nail polish within the first few hours.</li>
            <li>I am a country woman who does not have a lot of time for beauty treatments - that&#x27;s pretty obvious if you know me - but this nail polish does dry just as instantly as it claims.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you don&#x27;t put a thick layer on, because it&#x27;ll take a bit longer to fully dry.</li>
            <li>my nail polish dried right away after putting this on and my nails have not chipped yet after having the polish on for 4 days.</li>
            <li>not a kind of dry that you can scratch your nail and not cause damage, but a kind of dry</li>
            <li>After 3 days my polish is still on whereas usually my polish would chip within 2-3 days using other top coats.  </li>
            <li>I found it works no better than any other top coat I&#x27;ve used, regardless of brand.</li>
            <li>it is like any other clear base or top coat, except it works so much better.</li>
            <li>It does not dry in 30 seconds like it says on the box.</li>
            <li>see some say it causes peeling, or does not dry in 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li>The next time I did my nails, I used a polish that I&#x27;d worn a few weeks prior (it dried quickly and without incident the first time).</li>
            <li>If the polish is even a little tacky, is not completely dry and will most likely be marked/dented/damaged somehow if you mess around with them!</li>
            <li>It dries 100% firm in 30 seconds, no smudges, no chips, no weird indents, or finger prints.</li>
            <li>I am a total product junkie, always looking for an excuse to try something new, but I will definitely be sticking to this topcoat.</li>
            <li>Leaves my nails hard and super shiney.</li>
            <li>I am one of those girls that always smudges nail polish because I don&#x27;t have the patience to sit there and wait for the topcoat to dry completely.  </li>
            <li>Dry completely.</li>
            <li>Over the past few weeks, I&#x27;ve fallen in love with polishing my nails.</li>
            <li>what it don&#x27;t like is that after awhile of use it gets very stringy and makes a mess</li>
            <li>I try to get a professional manicure which is waaaaay less than Shellac and acrylics so they can do a professional job on my cuticles.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly but you still have to be careful not to bump your nails on anything for a few hours.</li>
            <li>put down two coats of my main color</li>
            <li>My nail polish did NOT dry as fast as it claimed, not did it dry all the way through in under an hour and a half.</li>

            <li> my holy grail, dries in no time and great price.  </li>
            <li> But until that point, it&#x27;s a great topcoat.</li>
            <li> Love it!!</li>
            <li> so I am never without my favorite polish drier!!</li>
            <li> Very nice product, does what it says.</li>
            <li> Nice I think it is a very good product.</li>
            <li> This topcoat goes on nicely!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best top coats I have tried.</li>

            <li> This is a great, great, great top coat.</li>
            <li> Great top coat!</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, though, I got this for like 4.50 at Target</li>
            <li> (I also got some good tips from product reviews)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good with no chips for a good week</li>
            <li> But when it does set...it sets good.</li>
            <li> But for the price it is a good product.  </li>
            <li> I use a mini fan and allow 3 mins drying time between coats and then give a good 7-10 mins after applying this topcoat and my nails never smear or smudge.</li>
            <li> I can still get a good 4-5 days out of my polish when I use this topcoat.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> The gloss isnt superior</li>
            <li> My nails stay perfect for much longer now!!!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best topcoat I&#x27;ve used - it dries quickly (within 30 seconds) and gives your nails a shiny finish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, many others, including salon brands, and this is what&#x27;s worked best for me</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!!!  </li>
            <li> really interesting - if you are in doubt, go on, it works really fine!!!</li>
            <li> Great top coat</li>
            <li> Great top coat</li>
            <li> I have used every nail product known to man, and this is the best instant drier you can buy at an amazing price!!</li>
            <li> got the package very early which made me happy; arrived nicely with no damage and works great!</li>
            <li> i am pleased with the product!</li>
            <li> But 30 minutes beats an hour (or more!)</li>
            <li> Now i paint them wait a bit and its like magic!</li>
            <li> I will be buying more!</li>
            <li> This top coat is a staple in my manicure box!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love nail art!</li>
            <li> Love this!  </li>
            <li> Looks AMAZING on</li>
            <li> Amazing- goof proof polish finish.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing..</li>
            <li> this is so amazing...</li>
            <li> This is amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> Truly amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this producto for years, and always has amazing result.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, nice price.</li>
            <li> I have always done my own nails &amp; this</li>
            <li> My finger nails look really shiny and great!</li>
            <li> Leaves a nice shine.</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely the best.  </li>
            <li> Use 2 coats of any kind of polish and for one of the coats lock in the polish meaning as you polish, glide the polish across the front of the nail to seal it in, this is also important.&lt;br /&gt;5.  </li>
            <li> Because I do my own mani/pedis</li>
            <li> This product does leave a nice shine on your nail polish.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s that good :-)</li>
            <li> This is remarkably effective stuff.  </li>
            <li> leaves a nice shine...</li>
            <li> all those nice things.</li>
            <li> kind of like the gel manicures at the salons.  </li>
            <li> Nice, glossy finish.</li>
            <li> Great product it dries nail polish quickly but doesn&#x27;t prevent the polish from chipping.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff, quick drying and a lot of shine</li>
            <li> Excellent fast drying top coat.  </li>
            <li> The best top coat and drys fast.</li>
            <li> My longest manicure has lasted 5 days with this on, so that&#x27;s pretty good if you ask me!</li>
            <li> I love this top coat!</li>
            <li> Love this Top Coat!</li>
            <li> Save it &amp; buy a better top coat!</li>
            <li> Having used probably dozens of &amp;#34;quick drying&amp;#34; polishes over the years, this one works by far the best.</li>
            <li> Before I was using Spoiled&#x27;s top coat and it took 2-3 coats to look this nice, and about 20x longer to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I LOVE, love, love the two products together!</li>
            <li> Love love love it!</li>
            <li> I love, love, LOVE this top coat!</li>
            <li> Works great, dries fast!</li>
            <li> It gives my manicure a beautiful shine and doesn&#x27;t cause shrinkage like Seche Vite&#x27;s fast drying top coat.</li>
            <li> Slept on a fresh manicure with this top coat and still shiny impeccable in the AM.</li>
            <li> It does a good job of drying quickly...</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this polish and plan on continuing to use it.</li>
            <li> Writing this now as quite impressed and may not have time to come back</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I use it on top of my essie top coat.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I use this more for the shine and protection of my nails than I do the quick-drying aspect.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I LOVE</li>
            <li> /&gt;Any suggestions for a better quick-dry top coat?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Top Coat for years now and it serves me well.</li>
            <li> The directions say to wait 2 minutes after applying color then apply the top coat.</li>
            <li> I tried a lot of top coat</li>
            <li> Works better than anything I have ever tried, including the products my salon uses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite top coat to date.</li>
            <li> I love the look of polished nails, whether it&#x27;s color or just shine.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this top coat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been touching and tapping my nails trying to get them to show a ding</li>
            <li> I love it.    </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t using a top coat per se.</li>
            <li> I was just using Sally Hansen Diamond Strength hardener as a top coat</li>
            <li> I got on amazon and decided to give the Sally Hansen insta-dry anti-chip top coat a try.</li>
            <li> Top it off with the insta-dry anti-chip polish</li>
            <li> If you apply two layer of color and then apply the top coat</li>
            <li> what I&#x27;ve seen, this top coat doesn&#x27;t do what it says.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years and</li>
            <li> an i thought i&#x27;d give it a try... where has this top coat been all my life?!?!?!&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li> so i was able to, albeit with some difficulty, peel the polish off my nails rather than have to remove it with acetone.&lt;br /&gt;i plan on using this product with any and all</li>
            <li> I had never used a top coat before this, and I regret not finding this sooner.</li>
            <li> I also love that it doesn&#x27;t have a funky color to it.</li>
            <li> My nails are always painted and I have gone through so many products trying to find the \\&quot;one\\&quot;....</li>
            <li> I had doubts it would work, but am SO glad I gave it a shot.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I totally love this top coat.</li>
            <li> I tried the polish again without the top coat</li>
            <li> I love this top coat</li>
            <li> Definitely one of the best top coats I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> My favorite Sally Hansen top coat.  </li>
            <li> Looks like I&#x27;m better off without this top coat.</li>
            <li> More like 2-4 mins.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe l payed close to 10$ for essie \\&quot;no chip&#x27;s ahead top coat\\&quot; and it did nothing for me,</li>
            <li> Will by AGAIN!!!!:)</li>
            <li> This top coat does not keep polish on.</li>
            <li> I use this on top of my nail color and my polish still chips.</li>
            <li> But I still love to paint and care for my nails.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Today I purchased this top coat, Sally Hanson Insta-Dri and brought it home to use on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This top coat is holding up</li>
            <li> and I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Dries within seconds of application and protects nails from chipping and breaking for more than a week if you want.</li>
            <li> and I find Seche Vite to be better for me.</li>
            <li> Based on some reviews for this top coat I bought it.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely worth it!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING - it dries incredibly quickly and leaves your nails shiny and chip-free for days.  </li>
            <li> Nice product, received quick.</li>
            <li> I mostly use &amp;#34;quick dry&amp;#34; nail polishes, but they STILL smudge easily</li>
            <li> this product is okay, not really the best.</li>
            <li> I can put this on at night, and in minutes I am in bed , asleep, and wake up with perfect nails because this stuff does such a fantastic job of drying your nails to prevent any damage to them while they are still in the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Great for polishing the nails of young girls who can&#x27;t sit still for more than about a minute.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for drying nail polish quickly--especially for brands like Essie polish that seem to take forever to dry!</li>
            <li> dries extremely quickly, has a very smooth feel, does not affect the nail polish underneath and protects from chipping like magic.</li>
            <li> ON CHEAP NAIL POLISH SOMETIMES GUARANTEE YOU WILL HAVE LOVE IT</li>
            <li> The drying time of this top coat is comparable to that of Seche Vite and the shine is pretty nice too.</li>
            <li> Best top coat, hands down.</li>
            <li> I love being able to function so quickly after painting my nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tried all the high end top coats and by far this has been the best!</li>
            <li> It does take a little more than 30 seconds, but within 2 minutes it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> think dry-kwik dries them faster, but makes them chip easily.</li>
            <li> If the price is too steep for you, I think you can easily skip it.</li>
            <li> all that great ( its not a proper top coat polish</li>
            <li> - it dries very quickly..  </li>
            <li> The best reason you need this now, if ONLY for this reason: You can sleep without smudging your fresh nails (fingers OR toes)</li>
            <li> Buff your nails first to ensure your nail bed is nice and smooth</li>
            <li> She always use it for her nails and manicure keeps fine for 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> The Sally Hansen insta-dry chip top coat does just what it says it will do, dries quickly and keeps my nail polish from chipping.</li>
            <li> and if you don&#x27;t do too much laborous activity you will be able to go easily for 3-4 days, sometimes even 5!</li>
            <li> and it is a very pretty glossy top coat.  </li>
            <li> This works great, dries clear and quickly.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t put it on top of freshly painted polish however</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve found that it keeps the paint chip free longer, even after days of doing the dishes.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product and a must-have for all nail buffs (pun intended).  </li>
            <li> Great for polishing toe nails in colder climates in the winter so that you can get your socks back on before your feet freeze!</li>
            <li> I got a gel nail kit and absolutely loved it, until I developed an allergic reaction to the polish.  </li>
            <li> Ok, so right now, I just put it on.</li>
            <li> it dries in 10 seconds its shiny it like gel polish in love right now</li>
            <li> Just some seconds and our nails are ready over a week!!!</li>
            <li> bought this particular product to dry my nails more quickly, and that&#x27;s what it does, so I&#x27;m happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> But the shine is nice, and if you&#x27;re going for a top coat, the relatively quick dry time and the lack of shrinking make it a pretty good one.</li>
            <li> I am able to type this review without worrying about my nails getting messed up because it really works!</li>
            <li> but for the most part it holds pretty well.</li>
            <li> This top coat dries extremely fast!</li>
            <li> I had originally purchased this product because of the reviews that I read on Amazon</li>
            <li> I have never owned a top coat that didn&#x27;t chip within the first 24hrs.</li>
            <li> dry.&lt;br /&gt;Not a clean and neat finish.</li>
            <li> Goes on SO smoothly and evenly, dries quickly to a super-glossy shine.  </li>
            <li> Cheap, easy to find in person, and works wonders without all of the quirks of other popular top coats.</li>
            <li> Polish dries almost instantly and makes a nice super shiny top coat.  </li>
            <li> As for dry time, you can&#x27;t get better and at such a great cost!</li>
            <li> I reccomend you get this product right now!</li>
            <li> Water gets under the paint and it flakes right off in chunks!</li>
            <li> However, it is a very shiny top coat.</li>
            <li> I really want to test it :).</li>
            <li> but I will try to when I do a full mani.</li>
            <li> OK this dries really fast.  </li>
            <li> This is true.</li>
            <li> If it performed for the whole product use my rating would be better</li>
            <li> I just bought this polish for a good friend and my entire book club...</li>
            <li> Fast delivery which I love.</li>
            <li> Very shiny top coat and keeps my nails from chipping.</li>
            <li> top coat is very shiny, even after just one coat.</li>
            <li> take it to the nail salon when I get pedicures because it dries so much faster than the top coats at the salon.  </li>
            <li> It chips pretty easily for me.</li>
            <li> Other than that its a great product.</li>
            <li> Drys quick.</li>
            <li> U will just love it ur nail polish will last for a week or maybe more .</li>
            <li> Many people mistake my regular nail polish for a gel manicure when I use this top coat.</li>
            <li> relatively quickly-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve always eschewed, mainly because they&#x27;ve always smudged after I applied the top coat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It dries quickly and keeps my nail polish from chipping.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It evens out your polish and gives you a super shiny finish.</li>
            <li> (Without, I&#x27;m lucky to get 24 hours before chips.)&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to have any effect on how quickly my nails chipped either.</li>
            <li> I also love the high shine this polish gives.  </li>
            <li> This top coat puts the perfect touch of glass clear and hard coating over your polish.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this inexpensive, high-quality purchase, and will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> but I normally do), added two coats of sparkle polish, and then (after waiting two minutes) put this top coat on.</li>
            <li> It does dry super quick, but it does not keep my nails from chipping any more than when I don&#x27;t use a top coat.</li>
            <li> This will be my new &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; top coat.</li>
            <li> My manicures are now flawless, super-glossy, and long lasting.</li>
            <li> This dries them to the touch quickly but they can still gouge for a bit after, so I try not to do anything that will beat them up right away.</li>
            <li> This is the best topcoat out there!It dries your nails super fats so you can move on with your life and do other important things rather than sitting there waiting for your nails to dry.</li>
            <li> This stuff dries so fast that as you&#x27;re polishing, it is already drying-so polish quickly!</li>
            <li> It IS effective in drying your nails quickly, but it&#x27;s kind of pointless considering it makes the polish PEEL OFF pretty soon after.  </li>
            <li> This topcoat is amazing cause as soon as it dries it is seriously hard to the touch and has a nice finish</li>
            <li> But this product&#x27;s PRIMARY claim is INSTA-DRI and that it absolutely does.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently began doing my own manicures to save money.</li>
            <li> The only good is requires is shine and fast drying time.</li>
            <li> so you will not AFRAID to go about your life...</li>
            <li> this product, I can change my nail polish at night while watching TV, then wake up in the morning without sheet-prints on my fresh polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> good test to see if your nails are truly dry is to VERY gently touch two of your nails together.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry so quick!!!</li>
            <li> if you do it the old fashioned way with normal top coat!</li>
            <li> I felt that though it worked incredibly well as a quick dry my nails would chip almost instantly</li>
            <li> Dries your nails super fast with no smudges!</li>
            <li> On the plus side, this is the best instant dry polish I have ever bought!!!  </li>
            <li> Air bubbles aren&#x27;t too much of a problem either, just make sure you smooth the polish down evenly :)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect to do dishes right away or anything, but this stuff is a life saver.</li>
            <li> So if you do your nails right before bed, you will find dents in the morning.</li>
            <li> My sister recommended it to me and she was right.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading the reviews at a local drug store and everything is true!!  </li>
            <li> After 4 days my polish is still on &amp; looking pretty good, considering I have an active lifestyle with a career and kids.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, nails are dry within seconds, life changer</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable for what it is, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It dries my nails very fast which I appreciate because my nails always get messed up as soon as I go to sleep.  </li>
            <li> Just get a dry quick top coat.</li>
            <li> Rock hard and great shine.</li>
            <li> Although this top coat dries very fast my nails still start chipping the next day.</li>
            <li> Sally Hansen Dries Instantly - Dri Anti chip top coat works</li>
            <li> My nails are so glossy and pretty that everyone keeps asking me where I got my nails done.  </li>
            <li> Dries fast!  </li>
            <li> I only apply one coat and make sure to not overlap brush strokes and it still smears the designs.  </li>
            <li> I love that this top coat actually dries instantly.  </li>
            <li> BUT this top coat has the dreaded \\&quot;peeling\\&quot; effect in that a day or two later some nail polish will just \\&quot;peel off\\&quot;!  </li>
            <li> This really works!  </li>
            <li> Dries as fast as it says, gives an amazing finish that looks and feels like salon quality, and makes my polish last much longer than otherwise.</li>
            <li> when you apply two coats, this top coat will later cause in your nail polish looking</li>
            <li> Make sure you wash your hands prior to manicure to remove all oils.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately my nail polish still chips and doesn&#x27;t stay perfect stay any longer than 4 days.</li>
            <li> Overall, this top coat does its job.</li>
            <li> then I waited the 2 minutes and applied this as the final top coat.</li>
            <li> I think it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I used this top coat for years, until last year when I picked up a bottle of Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> This polish performed exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> After the first time I bought this, I&#x27;ve kept it in stock all the time.  </li>
            <li> Vanity ranks quite low on my priority list most days.</li>
            <li> Seche Vite gives a higher shine, but causes the nail polish to shrink from the cuticle and nail tip.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the others, and this is the top coat I keep coming back to.</li>
            <li> A nail chipped, but still pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This really works!</li>
            <li> I must have 15 different top coat polishes.  </li>
            <li> will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> it happened with my first nail polish color.</li>
            <li> Instantly so I like it a bit better.</li>
            <li> constantly buying and giving away my bottle of this top coat.</li>
            <li> - I can now get through a whole week without having my polish chipped to the point of embarrassment!  </li>
            <li> I use it as my only top coat</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used two top coats - Seche Vite and this one</li>
            <li> However, to apply on top of a color it takes forever to dry, much longer than my old top coat.</li>
            <li> I need something that keeps my nail polish on longer and also dries quickly, along with a high gloss finish.  </li>
            <li> This is great for the instant dry feature but it does not prevent chipping.  </li>
            <li> during the first use, after 3-4 days i did notice the front edge of the nail showed some very subtle wear, like the polish was rubbed off, but that was due to the use of my hands, no chipping though, none of the usual bubbling on the sides of the nail, it was perfect, and especially great for feet that are in sandals all day&lt;</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try because of the positive reviews and I must agree.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty ironic that the title of this product says Anti-chip.</li>
            <li> So I have to wait a long while to put on the top coat.</li>
            <li> Prior to finding this product, I&#x27;d gotten to where I assumed I&#x27;d never be able to keep up a decent manicure.  </li>
            <li> and I let the topcoat dry for 5-10 minutes just to be on the safe side.  </li>
            <li> I put this on as a top coat, and in about 10 minutes my nails are perfectly dry.</li>
            <li> Even better, 30 seconds after I&#x27;ve applied this stuff, my nails are dry to the touch.</li>
            <li> Then apply one layer of the top coat and it will dry to the touch in 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I just put it on my bare nails to get a nice shine and it looks terrific and it lasts almost two weeks.</li>
            <li> This item does work as far as drying your nails quickly and I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Love it so much, I can&#x27;t believe more salons do not carry this treasure - they can move the customers out faster than that painfully slow nail dryer that you have to sit through two cycles before you feel secure enough to grab something out of your purse.</li>
            <li> Not too certain</li>
            <li> Even after several days my fingernails look pretty nice especially for me.</li>
            <li> Not sure how this is not a problem for others, but I&#x27;ve tried this product twice and on both occasions my OPI nail polish (that on its own lasts 4-5 days minimum), with this top coat is getting peeled off the following day.</li>
            <li> This top coat does dry extremely fast.  </li>
            <li> top coat ever but does dry really fast.</li>
            <li> right after I take off my polish before I start the new manicure.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find a good one without having to spend a fortune.</li>
            <li> There is no false advertising here or exaggeration about it&#x27;s abilities.</li>
            <li> Amazing because you do not need to go to the nail Salam and waste money on someting that can doo at homeð</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I can never have too much of it.</li>
            <li> It protects your nail polish very well</li>
            <li> Dries your manicure so fast that I&#x27;m still amazed by it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> SO MUCH</li>
            <li> This stuff really works...</li>
            <li> It really is quick-dry, your polish color will be set within a minute.</li>
            <li> Would be MUCH appreciated!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It dries out fast, leaves my nails glamorously shiny and protects the polish from chipping too fast.</li>
            <li> I have been spending waay too much money at the salon doing gel nails (shellac) and also acrylics.  </li>
            <li> but it really does make your nails shine</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> so I used sinful colors too shine coat which makes it really glossy</li>
            <li> it really does the job.  </li>
            <li> I used another nail polish - not fast drying - and used this top coat after waiting a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine that it really works.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does dry my nails super quick.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t touch your hair, turn the pages of a book, use the computer -- all you can really do is just sit there and pray for the Nail Polish Goddess to finish her</li>
            <li> I love painting my nails and have been stuck on doing my own French manicure lately.</li>
            <li> Wash my hands really well with soap and water.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> This stuff really does work.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> but I was really pushing it.</li>
            <li> Helps keep nail polish shiny, but as for it being anti-chip... not so much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really affordable too.</li>
            <li> I really does sry in about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> I swear this stuff really dries in seconds.</li>
            <li> Delivery is really fast.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be ready for it.</li>
            <li> This product really works!&lt;br</li>
            <li> highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> She says it really works.</li>
            <li> so manicures happen very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> I really like that about it.</li>
            <li> Dries really fast and prevent from chipping.</li>
            <li> This works really well.</li>
            <li> Ot dries the outer layer not the whole paint job fully through though.</li>
            <li> It works, i whole week withou a chip</li>
            <li> Dries fast.</li>
            <li> It leaves a strong, shiny coat that seems to dry ALL layers quickly; I&#x27;m always surprised by this fact.</li>
            <li> It does dry instantly and keeps my nails looking pretty nice.</li>
            <li> TO PROTECT MY MANICURE, I took off the gloves to find that my one day old manicure has chipped away!!!</li>
            <li> I will just have to continue my hunt to find a long lasting top coat!</li>
            <li> it was better than I expected!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have the time or patience to do my nails every other day which is almost what you have to do when using this top coat.  </li>
            <li> It works better than any other topcoat out there, no matter what the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works better than any other topcoat that I bought.</li>
            <li> I should have stuck with my other top coat (Revlon, nothing fancy at all).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll go to bed with nails that would end up with sheet marks if I were wearing any other brand of polish, but this one dries like magic.</li>
            <li> But l have  none of those problems no more with Sally Hansen Insta-Dri top coat!</li>
            <li> This top cost dries super fast and goes on thick.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is it doesn&#x27;t try super fast.</li>
            <li> This topcoat is super shiny, dries nails fast, &amp; helps polish last longer.</li>
            <li> Just love Sally Hansen Insta Dry, Chip top Coat, it makes my nail polish dry fast and last forever&amp;#62; I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> So after reading these reviews, I decided to give this product a try, and WOW, it really works!</li>
            <li> Otherwise, Sally Hansen Insta-Dry is a true miracle product, and I can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
            <li> Therefore, I have been doing my own testing trying to find the right combination that will allow me to have a natural manicure for at least 3-4 days and with this product I found it.  </li>
            <li> I put a light layer of the diamond strength hardener and let it dry</li>
            <li> I accidentally shattered the bottle of my previous top coat, so I decided to go for an upgrade when I replaced it.</li>
            <li> It dries polish quickly and last up to one week before it chips.</li>
            <li> Not a big problem since I go through it quickly.</li>
            <li> that the more expensive products that you assume will work better, i.e. OPI.</li>
            <li> on a french manicure where it&#x27;s very evident if it chips.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for anyone,  with any polish.</li>
            <li> But I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell you exactly how old my bottle was when it did, but it was under 2 years old and when the bottle got low it got goopy and much more likely to smudge the manicure.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a good, solid dry set; enough so that you can return amongst the living.  </li>
            <li> They MEAN &amp;#34;insta-dri&amp;#34; and love that!</li>
            <li> I actually use it alone sometimes for a professional clean look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;</li>
            <li> It really does dry quick.</li>
            <li> and I was surprised how fast it dries.  </li>
            <li> so I really dug in with another nail and got an indentation but was surprised not too smudgy.</li>
            <li> It does work on drying the nail polish faster, although I think it doesn&#x27;t help much on preventing early chipping.</li>
            <li> This top coat means I can move within a few minutes &amp; chips</li>
            <li> This product really does make your nails touch-dry very quickly, but only touch dry - any pressure and the polish underneath will crumple and slip.</li>
            <li> It really is dry to touch in 30 seconds, but I like to give it a full 2 or 3 minutes before doing anything.</li>
            <li> I absolutely can&#x27;t live without this product.  </li>
            <li> I use OPI&#x27;s quick dry spray on time and it does the trick.</li>
            <li> It does dry relatively quickly though.</li>
            <li> I already had a manicure that I did a few days ago with a cheapie clear top coat.</li>
            <li> It does dry the nails quickly, but it also chips the polish within hours, not days of wear.</li>
            <li> Made my polish dry quickly but kinda made it crack.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I plan to redo my manicure this weekend with all the good stuff-OPI no chip base coat, Sally Hansen polish and this top coat.</li>
            <li> It really does dry your nail polish very fast without smudging.    </li>
            <li> Most top coats dry on the surface only, leaving a wet, gloopy layer below it, so even when it&#x27;s dry to the touch</li>
            <li> and really does dry fast!</li>
            <li> and I touched the first nail, then the second, etc.</li>
            <li> Usually around 30 minutes is when it&#x27;s safe to start using your hands again.</li>
            <li> I do only minor touch ups using Sally Hansen complete salon manicure with the Insta-dri top coat, and I&#x27;m a busy mom of two young kids.</li>
            <li> As long as you follow the 2 minute rule on the box you are golden</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for the first time tonight.</li>
            <li> But seems to go on thickly and chips pretty quickly!</li>
            <li> B00150LT40 Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat]] to cut down on the drying time, but</li>
            <li> you can see the new growth line and it does not look professional.  </li>
            <li> This is well worth the price seeing as before I would have to literally wait hours for my polish to fully dry or end up accidentally smudging them somehow.  </li>
            <li> But at least with this top coat I can type on my computer, use a gaming controller or do other simple things that I wasn&#x27;t able to do before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Small price to pay for high gloss, no shrinkage, and a mani that lasts for easily 4-5 days.</li>
            <li> Decent price, less than some, quick shipping and</li>
            <li> When I apply the Sally Hansen Insta Dry, my manicure sets right away</li>
            <li> This product takes more than 3 minutes to dry several different nail polishes.</li>
            <li> Not only does it dry any nail polish within minutes, it also protects your manicure better so that it will last for almost a week without chipping!  </li>
            <li> I really liked the shellac because it does last 10 days but unfortunately for me my nails grow too quickly so by day 5 or 6</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also not clear on how much faster it dries than regular nail polish - the other day I had to go without, and my Spoiled brand nail polish (which is only so-so) seemed to dry pretty quickly on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> This is the only clear nail polish that has ever really worked for me.</li>
            <li> Based on my wife&#x27;s reaction, she was surprised that it really did \\&quot;instantly</li>
            <li> It instantly dries your nails but makes them chip like so fast.</li>
            <li> If you are like me, a professional manicure destroyer, this will be a lifeline.</li>
            <li> I remove all the old polish with polish remover.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it isn&#x27;t really 10 days antichip.</li>
            <li> It dries fast, but peel the following day.</li>
            <li> It seems to completely harden after 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> As of yet I haven&#x27;t kept the shine and no-chip feature for ten whole days . . .</li>
            <li> : It&#x27;s been three days and the only real chips I&#x27;ve had to my manicure</li>
            <li> : It&#x27;s been three days and the only real chips I&#x27;ve had to my manicure</li>
            <li> I apply it before my color coat is completely</li>
            <li> Looks great, but dries slow for being &amp;#34;instant.&amp;#34; Chips after just a few days.</li>
            <li> It dries very fast , give nails a lot of shine and keep the color intact very long</li>
            <li> I  mean it&#x27;s a top coat.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty dry.</li>
            <li> It does dry fast!</li>
            <li> Not only does it dry quickly</li>
            <li> This top coat actually dries ALL the way through in just a few minutes!</li>
            <li> But if you need to paint and run, as long as you are careful you will find this a very useful product.</li>
            <li> Use this top coat with Sally Hansen&#x27;s complete salon manicure polish, and your manicure will last at least a week.</li>
            <li> My only gripe is that while this top coat does \\&quot;set within 30 seconds\\&quot;, it doesn&#x27;t actually cure the polish until a few hours in.</li>
            <li> I thought it was me being over active the first time (washing hands frequently, household chores, etcetera)</li>
            <li> There are no instructions to say how long before it should be dry per going about normal activities (how I ended up here ;)).</li>
            <li> I live overseas, and it is about 13 euros a bottle (about $17.50 at current exchange rates.)</li>
            <li> I was sceptical about the &amp;#34;instant dry&amp;#34; thing, but it did dry quite fast, with 5-10 mins I didn&#x27;t have to be &amp;#34;careful&amp;#34; with my nails.</li>
            <li> It does dry adequately fast, but doesn&#x27;t fully settle for a bit.  </li>
            <li> When a friend does them and uses either nothing or Dry Kwik they seem to chip much faster.</li>
            <li> My nails really do already feel like they&#x27;ve been dry forever.</li>
            <li> You really have to wait 2-3 minuted before putting this on and then another minute before your nails are truly dry.</li>
            <li> It does dry your nails fast.</li>
            <li> Also, because the surface does dry so quickly, it takes a bit longer for the polish underneath to dry fully.</li>
            <li> It also last pretty long.</li>
            <li> It dried quickly and I must say it does make ur nail feel thicker.</li>
            <li> Dried quickly which is a plus when you paint your nails before bed.</li>
            <li> Drys fast if you just want to use it as a single layer coat.</li>
            <li> I was worried that you could only paint one coat of actual nail polish/color before using this top coat, but in reality I did two coats (pretty thick ones at that), waited the two minutes and boom, dry to the touch.  </li>
            <li> My biggest qualm with the whole process is waiting for everything to dry!</li>
            <li> It gives my nails a great shine and seriously holds up against chipping for at least 8 or 9 days (and I use and wash my hands a lot in my profession).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hard on my hands, and this is the only product I&#x27;ve found that can get my manicures to last more than 24 hrs.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this product is sold in a clear bottle and the colored bottle above.</li>
            <li> It is clear, don&#x27;t let the red bottle fool you -</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical at first because I really didn&#x27;t think this was going to work, but it really does!</li>
            <li> For example, as far as I know, I only ordered one of these and received a quantity of four, and they cannot be returned.  </li>
            <li> I painted my nails barely 2-3 minutes ago</li>
            <li> I have not experienced a chipping effect, and I love how shiny it makes my nails look</li>
            <li> &amp; I frequently chip my nail polish within the first few hours.</li>
            <li> I am a country woman who does not have a lot of time for beauty treatments - that&#x27;s pretty obvious if you know me - but this nail polish does dry just as instantly as it claims.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you don&#x27;t put a thick layer on, because it&#x27;ll take a bit longer to fully dry.</li>
            <li> my nail polish dried right away after putting this on and my nails have not chipped yet after having the polish on for 4 days.</li>
            <li> not a kind of dry that you can scratch your nail and not cause damage, but a kind of dry</li>
            <li> After 3 days my polish is still on whereas usually my polish would chip within 2-3 days using other top coats.  </li>
            <li> I found it works no better than any other top coat I&#x27;ve used, regardless of brand.</li>
            <li> it is like any other clear base or top coat, except it works so much better.</li>
            <li> It does not dry in 30 seconds like it says on the box.</li>
            <li> see some say it causes peeling, or does not dry in 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> The next time I did my nails, I used a polish that I&#x27;d worn a few weeks prior (it dried quickly and without incident the first time).</li>
            <li> If the polish is even a little tacky, is not completely dry and will most likely be marked/dented/damaged somehow if you mess around with them!</li>
            <li> It dries 100% firm in 30 seconds, no smudges, no chips, no weird indents, or finger prints.</li>
            <li> I am a total product junkie, always looking for an excuse to try something new, but I will definitely be sticking to this topcoat.</li>
            <li> Leaves my nails hard and super shiney.</li>
            <li> I am one of those girls that always smudges nail polish because I don&#x27;t have the patience to sit there and wait for the topcoat to dry completely.  </li>
            <li> Dry completely.</li>
            <li> Over the past few weeks, I&#x27;ve fallen in love with polishing my nails.</li>
            <li> what it don&#x27;t like is that after awhile of use it gets very stringy and makes a mess</li>
            <li> I try to get a professional manicure which is waaaaay less than Shellac and acrylics so they can do a professional job on my cuticles.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly but you still have to be careful not to bump your nails on anything for a few hours.</li>
            <li> put down two coats of my main color</li>
            <li> My nail polish did NOT dry as fast as it claimed, not did it dry all the way through in under an hour and a half.</li>
            <li> For the instant dry I give a 5 star review, however I do have a major hang up with it.  </li>
            <li> The top coat is really tough, too--I don&#x27;t notice the chipping I do with other, often more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> This really does dry your nails in just a few short minutes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually careful since it doesn&#x27;t dry solid, it remains soft for a while</li>
            <li> It was getting pretty dull.</li>
            <li> It dries your nails but it makes my nail polish not last as long.</li>
            <li> The polish doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long though.</li>
            <li> my nail polish usually starts peeling off especially on the sides on day 2 due to excessive keyboard typing, washing dishes and cooking but not with this top coat</li>
            <li> For long lasting polish I wouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> so they last a very long time, without chipping or getting messed up.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this before bed, as I have thought my nails were totally dry after 30 minutes of waiting, but I wake up with wrinkles in my polish the next day.</li>
            <li> When everything is completely dry I like to add a coat of Sally Hansen Mega-Shine for extra gloss and toughness.</li>
            <li> After giving my finished nails 20 minutes to dry, I had the same problem, with my nail polish smudging after it should have been dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dries instantly, so you can do your nails and not wait around for them to dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dry to the touch after 30 seconds (set, but not completely dry all the way through), and you&#x27;re ready to get back to scratching your butt after a few minutes, with little or now chance of smudging.</li>
            <li> Hansen&#x27;s Instant Dry Topcoat is truly that -- instant dry!</li>
            <li> Sally Hansen&#x27;s Instant Dry Topcoat is truly that -- instant dry!</li>
            <li> I still haven&#x27;t found any product to do that other than possibly acrylics but even they don&#x27;t keep shine for ten days.  </li>
            <li> After one day of doing a full manicure and using this top coat, I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s helped all that much with chips, but then again, I&#x27;m hard on my nails, so...</li>
            <li> I have used Sally Hansen Products for a long time this one does not stay on nails it pops off.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any nicks or dings and I&#x27;m actually going about my life like I don&#x27;t have wet nails.</li>
            <li> I have learned that if I apply a thick coat of the polish (a blob, really) it seems to set up faster.  </li>
            <li> are WAY less frequent (note: I play dodge ball &amp; other things that wreck nails).</li>
            <li> Once when I had very long nails and did a lot of work it cracked and peeled a bit</li>
            <li> truly does dry in 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> With the Insta-Dri topcoat, I put it on my polish after letting it dry for about 5 minutes</li>
            <li> My nails dry to the touch in 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> After for 1 minutes your nails with polish become dry.</li>
            <li> but now, my nails are totally dry in about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Nails are dry to the touch within one or two minutes.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not quite dry to the touch in 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> Nailed dry in around 2 mins.</li>
            <li> When they say Insta dry, they aren&#x27;t kidding.</li>
            <li> BUT this one will make your nails touch dry</li>
            <li> It really is dry to the touch after a minute or so.</li>
            <li> Even when I think they&#x27;re dry, they&#x27;re not fully dry</li>
            <li> If my nail isn&#x27;t already completely dry, it streaks.</li>
            <li> And sometimes it streaks on some of my polish even though it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> My nails end up shiny and dry within 30 seconds, and there&#x27;s no chipping or peeling.</li>
            <li> I change my nail color almost every single day</li>
            <li> Well I was anxious to try so put on one coat on my thumb for experimental purposes, waited the 2 minutes and put on a coat of the Insta- Dri.</li>
            <li> One note of caution: it does take about an hour for all the layers of polish (presuming you&#x27;re using a base coat, 2-3 coats of polish, and a top coat) to fully harden, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend doing major housework/repairs, etc., as your nails WILL smudge.</li>
            <li> (I think the bottle says less) before applying after your last coat of color</li>
            <li> The product is clear and does dry in seconds but don&#x27;t make the mistake of going about your business because it does have to set the colors under it and needs a little (just a little) time to &#x27;harden up.&#x27;  </li>
            <li> This product reduced the nearly half hour wait for dry nails (and you know even then they&#x27;re not REALLY dry) down to basically 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> Well, the product is as expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Follow the 2 minute wait rule before you apply the polish on wet nails.</li>
            <li> but the polish doesn&#x27;t remain gooey or wet.</li>
            <li> (only takes a few minutes)</li>
            <li> Not very good....chipped almost immediately....</li>
            <li> it is almost like they eliminated the wet phase altogether.</li>
            <li> In my experience, seche vite does not streak and I can use it on wet nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that they become really solid, because I hate walking around trying not to touch anything in fear of messing my nails up.</li>
            <li> It sometimes leaves a whitish bubbly appearance as well which is frustrating to have when you spend so much time carefully painting and decorating.  </li>
            <li> and they were all dry!!   </li>
            <li> The SV certainly dries faster than the Insta Dri, but I was less than half a bottle in and the SV became unbearably thick and gloopy.</li>
            <li> On average, my nails would take about an hour to dry.  </li>
            <li> Invariably as soon as I manicure my nails, I have to do something that ruins them before the polish is completely dry and set.  </li>
            <li> My hands down go to produce to quickly dry my nails.</li>
            <li> I wish he Continuous Treatment was not discontinued because while it took some time to dry, my manicure lasted almost a week before I had any chips in my polish, and this was when I was a little harder on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , I use it every other day after I get a manicure to protect it from chips I have noticed a difference, esp.</li>
            <li> My other issue with this polish is that within abuot two days my nails are already chipping.  </li>
            <li> It chip like any other and not shiny at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i was skeptical when i saw the product on the shelf first</li>
            <li> Polish doesn&#x27;t chip until my next mani( usually 5 days).</li>
            <li> However, I am greatly disappointed in this top coat product.</li>
            <li> It is still susceptible to dents and other marks</li>
            <li> were self-inflicted, one with a nail grinder and another when I broke a small part of my nail off on a wooden door.</li>
            <li> were self-inflicted, one with a nail grinder and another when I broke a small part of my nail off on a wooden door.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other topcoats, including the much-raved-about Seche Vite (which just made my polishes peel within a day).</li>
            <li> I have tiny hands and tiny thin nails.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to wear polish because it just flakes off when I wash dishes and such.</li>
            <li> I put it on, and the next day, it chipped pretty badly on the front part of my index finger.</li>
            <li> but along with the peeling that others have mentioned, the useful life of this product is disappointing.</li>
            <li> It will make your nail polish last for at least a week without chipping even if you do dishes and type all day.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it does not set your manicure in 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> at least* ten to fifteen minutes before doing anything that might mark up your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used this as a base and top coat after one day of wear it chips and flakes off.</li>
            <li> It doesnât work a miracle in quite 30 seconds as it claims, especially if you are putting it over a layer of primer and two layers of polish, but in less than five minutes your finish is remarkably hard.  </li>
            <li> bought this to replace my Sally Hansen Continuous Treatment Base and Top Coat which I have had for years and love, only to be very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Now, the down side..</li>
            <li> No top coat is going to fully dry your nail polish</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now half hour</li>
            <li> Truly dries your nail done in three minutes or less.</li>
            <li> and this morning I woke up with half of them smeared and embossed with lines from my blanket/pillow.</li>
            <li> Within The Next Day Not A Good Topcoat For Your Polish</li>
            <li> This works, but you have to give it a little time to do its thing.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m a police officer and mother of 3 little ones).  </li>
            <li> and I managed to get to day 4 before I saw a little chip.</li>
            <li> This thing is not worth your money!</li>
            <li> I gave it fifteen minutes, which is all I&#x27;d ever needed before to do the finger print test, and was shocked to see that a light touch of my fingertip on the thumb of my other hand seriously smudged my polish.</li>
            <li> I mean they are dry to the touch</li>
            <li> The other polish dried immediately, and it&#x27;s one that usually takes forever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve rolled the bottle between my palms, shaken it, and even added a few drops of remover to loosen it up to no avail.</li>
            <li> literally dried in 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> It dries within a few minutes....</li>
            <li> I am not upset because I didn&#x27;t spend a lot for this, but I do feel that I wasted money.</li>
            <li> I always have trouble with chipping my nails</li>
            <li> If I can keep the majority of my color on my nails for a few days, I&#x27;ll be happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some other fast-dry topcoats are thick and cause nail polish to streak.  </li>
            <li> The polish is clumpy and the brush is stiff.</li>
            <li> You simply apply your base and color coats and then apply Insta-Dri and your nails are dry and you can actually return to life!  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s already gone bad on me whereas I have cheaper nail polishes that I bought 3 years ago that still paint like the first day.</li>
            <li> I usually put thinner in to make this useable again, but there tends to be a few bubbles even when I do that.</li>
            <li> Have tried 3 bottles and before I use half the bottle it has gotten too thick to brush on.  </li>
            <li> It is a little thick</li>
            <li> However, the nail polish had small chips on the nail border in 4-6 days.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s doing that thickening that polishes that are past</li>
            <li> If not better.</li>
            <li> s (small nick/smudge in the polish, etc).  </li>
            <li> It looks so weird and instead of chipping, the ends just come off in gradually the very next day.&lt;br /&gt;worst</li>
            <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure why I keep receiving duplicates of orders I purchased.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure contains some terrible chemicals</li>
            <li> What I absolutely hate is that feeling of being held prisoner of my fresh manicure.</li>
            <li> If it didn&#x27;t market itself as an anti-chip topcoat it would get 5 stars from me, unfortunately my nailpolish starts chipping by the 2nd DAY!  </li>
            <li> This is probably the worst top coat I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I usually change color by then.</li>
            <li> It is very frustrating especially when you spend a lot of time on the details.  </li>
            <li> But I was working too hard... maybe...</li>
            <li> (I work in banking, have a dishwasher, etc) or am hard on my nails and this still</li>
            <li> /&gt;- hard to remove excess off the brush</li>
            <li> and it gets hard to place on my nails.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m hard on my hands</li>
            <li> however the job is hard on them sometimes.</li>
            <li> I (naively) did try opening a sealed cellophane bag, which dinged two of my nails-</li>
            <li> Maybe ones who do are putting it on too thick.</li>
            <li> but I wish it didn&#x27;t get so thick as you got toward the end of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I decided to try 10 minutes but did not have the patience so after 7-8 minutes I pressed on it and got a very slight fingerprint impression (polish is metallic so smudge might look worse on non metallic).</li>
            <li> No more ruining my nails after going out of the salon!</li>
            <li> I put on my normal base coat, two coats of my nail polish, and then Insta-Dri.</li>
            <li> (Yeah, shallow</li>
            <li> I never liked painting my nails because i would hate to wait for them to dry and usually mess them up in the process.</li>
            <li> I wanted to test this out on my nails tonight since I was tired of them looking dull.</li>
            <li> (obviously you are digging at plastic or something you are going to have a bad time no matter what, but this blocks the majority of it)&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bad news it peels and chips next day.  </li>
            <li> I use a base coat + two coats of QUALITY polish (OPI, Essie, etc) and still the same problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> br /&gt;- thin formula</li>
            <li> I was a bit annoyed but redid my nail.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a game changer for three reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> I am going to try a sticky base coat soon and am hoping this helps with this problem of chipping polish the next day after painting.</li>
            <li> nails are quite brittle and thin, no matter what I do to help them get stronger, so I don&#x27;t expect this to save them from chipping.</li>
            <li> Just disappointed that I&#x27;ve spent over $7 on this.</li>
            <li> That is NOT good!    </li>
            <li> This happens especially after showering - SOOOO annoying!  </li>
            <li> and unfortunately I have to go against the grain on this one.</li>
            <li> &amp; I keep thinking maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong when I apply it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m discovering how flawed their nail polish is.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this stuff!</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I do think it goes bad</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy it because I thought the bottle was ugly.</li>
            <li> I am beyond frustrated.</li>
            <li> After panting my nails four an hour i was frustrated when they smudged so</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed in that product and will probably just use it as a standby when I run out of my Insta-Dri.</li>
            <li> :(  </li>
            <li> Simply disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in this polish.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in the product</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> And then my designs are ruined :(  </li>
            <li> Nail polish chip a day afterwards :(</li>
            <li> I always put on a base coat,</li>
            <li> I use it with Nutra Nail Strengthener as base coat.</li>
            <li> Also I hate when you put on the topcoat</li>
            <li> Use any type of base coat.  </li>
            <li> I never used a base coat.&lt;br /&gt;4.  </li>
            <li> I use opi base coat then a color coat.</li>
            <li> as your base, wait two minutes and apply a coat of this Insta-Dri.</li>
            <li> I use it with the &amp;#34;hard as nails&amp;#34; base coat.</li>
            <li> and I use opi no chip as the base coat.</li>
            <li> I hate it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t use a base coat this time</li>
            <li> Essie bonding base coat to adhere the polish to the nail</li>
            <li> also have horrible cuticles, so about once a month</li>
            <li> It smells awful</li>
            <li> If I try and use it, my nails end up with insane amount of bubbles.</li>

            <li> This is the only clear nail polish that has ever really worked for me. It does dry instantly and keeps my nails looking pretty nice. I am a country woman who does not have a lot of time for beauty treatments - that&#x27;s pretty obvious if you know me - but this nail polish does dry just as instantly as it claims. Even after several days my fingernails look pretty nice especially for me. I am pleased with this polish and plan on continuing to use it.</li>
            <li> Sally Hansen Dries Instantly - Dri Anti chip top coat works and I was surprised how fast it dries.  However, the nail polish had small chips on the nail border in 4-6 days.  But I was working too hard... maybe...</li>
            <li> I was sceptical about the &amp;#34;instant dry&amp;#34; thing, but it did dry quite fast, with 5-10 mins I didn&#x27;t have to be &amp;#34;careful&amp;#34; with my nails. I didn&#x27;t put it on top of freshly painted polish however, I use it every other day after I get a manicure to protect it from chips I have noticed a difference, esp. on a french manicure where it&#x27;s very evident if it chips. Decent price, less than some, quick shipping and i am pleased with the product! Took a gamble on it in case it did what it was advertised to do and it was better than I expected!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s this product but along with the peeling that others have mentioned, the useful life of this product is disappointing. I used this product in Fall and Winter of 2012, skipped Spring, and now I&#x27;ve pulled it out for Summer and it&#x27;s doing that thickening that polishes that are past their shelf-life do. I&#x27;ve rolled the bottle between my palms, shaken it, and even added a few drops of remover to loosen it up to no avail. The polish is clumpy and the brush is stiff. I bought this bottle around September of 2012 and it&#x27;s already gone bad on me whereas I have cheaper nail polishes that I bought 3 years ago that still paint like the first day. Don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ll purchase this again.</li>
            <li> This product takes more than 3 minutes to dry several different nail polishes. It does not dry in 30 seconds like it says on the box. However, it is a very shiny top coat.</li>
            <li> I just bought this SH Insta-Dri and found my favourite colour in a cheapo brand under $2 at Walmart, so bought that too. Well I was anxious to try so put on one coat on my thumb for experimental purposes, waited the 2 minutes and put on a coat of the Insta- Dri. After about a minute I remembered I should have stuck on the art before (just another experiment) but I still stuck it on. There are no instructions to say how long before it should be dry per going about normal activities (how I ended up here ;)). I decided to try 10 minutes but did not have the patience so after 7-8 minutes I pressed on it and got a very slight fingerprint impression (polish is metallic so smudge might look worse on non metallic). That was not enough so I really dug in with another nail and got an indentation but was surprised not too smudgy. It&#x27;s now half hour and it&#x27;s pretty dry. I imagine I could do dishes now - yeah I really want to test it :). Writing this now as quite impressed and may not have time to come back but I will try to when I do a full mani. Have to remember to do the &#x27;lock-in&#x27; one reviewer suggested and hope it does not peel like it does for some.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product ever since it came on the market years ago.  I have always done my own nails &amp; this truly does dry in 30 seconds.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Realmente funciona! Seca las u&amp;ntilde;as bien rapido y las deja brillantes. Lo compraria otra vez!</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading the reviews at a local drug store and everything is true!!  This really does dry your nails in just a few short minutes.  I always put on a base coat, then 2 coats of polish and then a topcoat. On average, my nails would take about an hour to dry.  Even if I went to bed 3 hours after I painted my nails I would ALWAYS wake up with crease marks in the polish.  With the Insta-Dri topcoat, I put it on my polish after letting it dry for about 5 minutes and I let the topcoat dry for 5-10 minutes just to be on the safe side.  After 10 minutes I was laying with my hand underneath my head and I didn&#x27;t get one chip, smudge, crease mark, NOTHING!!  My nails are so glossy and pretty that everyone keeps asking me where I got my nails done.  I am never paying for a manicure ever again with this product.</li>
            <li> Ok, so right now, I just put it on. I am able to type this review without worrying about my nails getting messed up because it really works! I put the nail polish on and after I finished them all and I touched the first nail, then the second, etc. and they were all dry!!   I was really skeptical at first because I really didn&#x27;t think this was going to work, but it really does! My finger nails look really shiny and great! I reccomend you get this product right now!</li>
            <li> I use this every time I polish. I absolutely love it. I buy it everywhere. I can never have too much of it. My nails dry to the touch in 30 seconds. Don&#x27;t expect to do dishes right away or anything, but this stuff is a life saver. I use it on top of my essie top coat.</li>
            <li> I love, love, LOVE this top coat! It gives my nails a great shine and seriously holds up against chipping for at least 8 or 9 days (and I use and wash my hands a lot in my profession). The only drawback is it doesn&#x27;t try super fast. Usually around 30 minutes is when it&#x27;s safe to start using your hands again. But 30 minutes beats an hour (or more!) if you do it the old fashioned way with normal top coat! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this before bed, as I have thought my nails were totally dry after 30 minutes of waiting, but I wake up with wrinkles in my polish the next day. Anyway, I use this more for the shine and protection of my nails than I do the quick-drying aspect. I recently tried switching to the [[ASIN:B00150LT40 Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat]] to cut down on the drying time, but I was really disappointed in that product and will probably just use it as a standby when I run out of my Insta-Dri. Try the Sally Hansen Insta-Dri-you won&#x27;t regret it! (Also, it&#x27;s cheaper at Target and Wal-Mart).</li>
            <li> ..If not better. I was hesitant to buy it because I thought the bottle was ugly. (Yeah, shallow I know.) Happy I ignored that and bought it anyway. Cheap, easy to find in person, and works wonders without all of the quirks of other popular top coats.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry so quick!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best topcoat out there!It dries your nails super fats so you can move on with your life and do other important things rather than sitting there waiting for your nails to dry. It protects your nail polish very well so they last a very long time, without chipping or getting messed up. Awesome product!!!!</li>
            <li> Drys quick. Looks AMAZING on but.... It chips pretty easily for me.</li>
            <li> Truly dries your nail done in three minutes or less. Love it so much, I can&#x27;t believe more salons do not carry this treasure - they can move the customers out faster than that painfully slow nail dryer that you have to sit through two cycles before you feel secure enough to grab something out of your purse.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.Dries your manicure so fast that I&#x27;m still amazed by it. Leaves a nice shine. Only topcoat I use.</li>
            <li> Great top coat! I use it with Nutra Nail Strengthener as base coat. This top coat puts the perfect touch of glass clear and hard coating over your polish. It will make your nail polish last for at least a week without chipping even if you do dishes and type all day. I even worked in the garden (with gloves). Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Nice I think it is a very good product. I would buy it again and again. I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> Shiny!  Dries fast!  Some other fast-dry topcoats are thick and cause nail polish to streak.  This topcoat goes on nicely! Hasn&#x27;t chipped after 4 days.  Also, it does not contain formaldehyde, tuolene, or DBP.</li>
            <li> This polish does a great job at drying your manicure within minutes.  It also smooths out any imperfections you may have in your color/s (small nick/smudge in the polish, etc).  However, if you do any sort of nail art on your nails, this will smear it!  I only apply one coat and make sure to not overlap brush strokes and it still smears the designs.  It is very frustrating especially when you spend a lot of time on the details.  My other issue with this polish is that within abuot two days my nails are already chipping.  I don&#x27;t do a lot of work with my hands (I work in banking, have a dishwasher, etc) or am hard on my nails and this still happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to replace my Sally Hansen Continuous Treatment Base and Top Coat which I have had for years and love, only to be very disappointed.  I wish he Continuous Treatment was not discontinued because while it took some time to dry, my manicure lasted almost a week before I had any chips in my polish, and this was when I was a little harder on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have the time or patience to do my nails every other day which is almost what you have to do when using this top coat.  I have used it multiple times with the same results.  I will just have to continue my hunt to find a long lasting top coat!</li>
            <li> This product actually does what it advertises.  Based on my wife&#x27;s reaction, she was surprised that it really did \\&quot;instantly dry\\&quot; her polish.</li>
            <li> Amazing- goof proof polish finish.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> For me, this is the best top coat ever made!!!</li>
            <li> Manicure LAST FOR 2 WEEKS I LOVE ITTTT AWESOME&lt;br /&gt;WORKS ON CHEAP NAIL POLISH SOMETIMES GUARANTEE YOU WILL HAVE LOVE IT SO MUCH</li>
            <li> This stuff really works... i dont know how but it does! I never liked painting my nails because i would hate to wait for them to dry and usually mess them up in the process. Now i paint them wait a bit and its like magic!</li>
            <li> It instantly dries your nails but makes them chip like so fast. this product is okay, not really the best.</li>
            <li> I love that this top coat actually dries instantly.  I am one of those girls that always smudges nail polish because I don&#x27;t have the patience to sit there and wait for the topcoat to dry completely.  Also I hate when you put on the topcoat but it seems to push your color around or adhere to the bristles, but that doesn&#x27;t happen at all with this polish.  For the instant dry I give a 5 star review, however I do have a major hang up with it.  I have tried using several different brands of nail polish including OPI, zoya, sally hansen, you name it but they all peel.  I don&#x27;t experience the peeling when I use my nail polish without the topcoat though.</li>
            <li> It Did Not Work My Nails Polish Still Chip Within The Next Day Not A Good Topcoat For Your Polish</li>
            <li> This stuff works great.  I am on my second bottle. It dries polish quickly and last up to one week before it chips. I have not had any problems at all with peeling.  Maybe ones who do are putting it on too thick.</li>
            <li> This top coat does dry extremely fast.  After 4 days my polish is still on &amp; looking pretty good, considering I have an active lifestyle with a career and kids.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING - it dries incredibly quickly and leaves your nails shiny and chip-free for days.  It really is quick-dry, your polish color will be set within a minute.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why the reviews ares so great with this product.  It does a good job of drying quickly...BUT this top coat has the dreaded \\&quot;peeling\\&quot; effect in that a day or two later some nail polish will just \\&quot;peel off\\&quot;!  This happens especially after showering - SOOOO annoying!  I will not be purchasing this again.  It IS effective in drying your nails quickly, but it&#x27;s kind of pointless considering it makes the polish PEEL OFF pretty soon after.  It doesn&#x27;t just chip off \\&quot;a little\\&quot; - the freakin&#x27; entire nail polish bed just comes off entirely.  :(  I&#x27;ve used this product 4-5 times and always have the same result.  I use a base coat + two coats of QUALITY polish (OPI, Essie, etc) and still the same problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any suggestions for a better quick-dry top coat?  Would be MUCH appreciated!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Crystal&lt;br /&gt;ashcraftcrystal@yahoo.com</li>
            <li> This really works!  Polish dries almost instantly and makes a nice super shiny top coat.  I will be buying more!</li>
            <li> Sally Hansen is one of my go-to&#x27;s for nail products.  This top coat is a staple in my manicure box! I actually use it alone sometimes for a professional clean look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;- thin formula&lt;br /&gt;- prevents chipping and scratches (obviously you are digging at plastic or something you are going to have a bad time no matter what, but this blocks the majority of it)&lt;br /&gt;- affordable&lt;br /&gt;- great shine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- hard to remove excess off the brush (get drips)&lt;br /&gt;- It does dry adequately fast, but doesn&#x27;t fully settle for a bit.  I use OPI&#x27;s quick dry spray on time and it does the trick.</li>
            <li> OK this dries really fast.  The bad news it peels and chips next day.  It peels off like skin from a sunburn.</li>
            <li> This topcoat is amazing cause as soon as it dries it is seriously hard to the touch and has a nice finish what it don&#x27;t like is that after awhile of use it gets very stringy and makes a mess and it gets hard to place on my nails.</li>
            <li> This is a great, great, great top coat. Use this top coat with Sally Hansen&#x27;s complete salon manicure polish, and your manicure will last at least a week. I do only minor touch ups using Sally Hansen complete salon manicure with the Insta-dri top coat, and I&#x27;m a busy mom of two young kids. I LOVE, love, love the two products together!</li>
            <li> Amazing product, nails are dry within seconds, life changer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Top Coat for years now and it serves me well. It dries out fast, leaves my nails glamorously shiny and protects the polish from chipping too fast. Couldn&#x27;t recommend it enough!</li>
            <li> Dries your nails super fast with no smudges!</li>
            <li> Dries as fast as it says, gives an amazing finish that looks and feels like salon quality, and makes my polish last much longer than otherwise. I get tons of compliments and people can&#x27;t believe I did it at home! Only downside is that the fast-drying quality makes the bottle and even the lacquer itself gum up after a while. Not a big problem since I go through it quickly.</li>
            <li> The Sally Hansen insta-dry chip top coat does just what it says it will do, dries quickly and keeps my nail polish from chipping.</li>
            <li> when you apply two coats, this top coat will later cause in your nail polish looking like it&#x27;s extra extra dry.&lt;br /&gt;Not a clean and neat finish. It looks so weird and instead of chipping, the ends just come off in gradually the very next day.&lt;br /&gt;worst top coat ever but does dry really fast.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this product is sold in a clear bottle and the colored bottle above. The product is clear and does dry in seconds but don&#x27;t make the mistake of going about your business because it does have to set the colors under it and needs a little (just a little) time to &#x27;harden up.&#x27;  All in all it&#x27;s a great product!!</li>
            <li> This works, but you have to give it a little time to do its thing. It is not truly hardened and it will allow gouges until it is well set. So don&#x27;t hurry.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best top coats I have tried. The directions say to wait 2 minutes after applying color then apply the top coat. My nails dried so fast and they stayed neat for days without chipping. I would definitely recommend trying this product.</li>
            <li> Best top coat, hands down. Almost works as a gel cover, and dries in seconds.</li>
            <li> I tried a lot of top coat but this one is the best . U will just love it ur nail polish will last for a week or maybe more .</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely the best.  I just painted my nails 5 minutes ago and here I am typing.  Keeps nails from scratches and smudges.  Perfect for salon-quality at-home manicures and pedicures.  Save money and impress your girlfriends with your beauty skills.  Definitely try this stuff out!</li>
            <li> I have been spending waay too much money at the salon doing gel nails (shellac) and also acrylics.  I really liked the shellac because it does last 10 days but unfortunately for me my nails grow too quickly so by day 5 or 6 you can see the new growth line and it does not look professional.  Therefore, I have been doing my own testing trying to find the right combination that will allow me to have a natural manicure for at least 3-4 days and with this product I found it.  I also found out some extra tips, here is what I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Buff your nails first to ensure your nail bed is nice and smooth, I was not doing this.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Make sure you wash your hands prior to manicure to remove all oils.  I was not doing this before.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Use any type of base coat.  I never used a base coat.&lt;br /&gt;4.  Use 2 coats of any kind of polish and for one of the coats lock in the polish meaning as you polish, glide the polish across the front of the nail to seal it in, this is also important.&lt;br /&gt;5.  Use this as a topcoat only 1 coat!  Not only does it dry quickly but it really does make your nails shine and if you don&#x27;t do too much laborous activity you will be able to go easily for 3-4 days, sometimes even 5! I try to do my laborous activities (washing laundry, mopping, etc) right after I take off my polish before I start the new manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have horrible cuticles, so about once a month I try to get a professional manicure which is waaaaay less than Shellac and acrylics so they can do a professional job on my cuticles.</li>
            <li> My hands down go to produce to quickly dry my nails. Works better than anything I have ever tried, including the products my salon uses.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! as described!</li>
            <li> Compraria novamente com certeza!</li>
            <li> Just some seconds and our nails are ready over a week!!! really interesting - if you are in doubt, go on, it works really fine!!!</li>
            <li> Works great, dries fast! No complaints</li>
            <li> This product really does make your nails touch-dry very quickly, but only touch dry - any pressure and the polish underneath will crumple and slip. Also, because the surface does dry so quickly, it takes a bit longer for the polish underneath to dry fully. But if you need to paint and run, as long as you are careful you will find this a very useful product. When everything is completely dry I like to add a coat of Sally Hansen Mega-Shine for extra gloss and toughness.</li>
            <li> My nail polish did NOT dry as fast as it claimed, not did it dry all the way through in under an hour and a half. Simply disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not only do I use this by itself, but over regular nail polish, and salon nails, too! Helps with the wear &amp; tear around the edges.</li>
            <li> The reviews don&#x27;t lie.. This stuff is amazing.. literally dried in 30 seconds. As long as you follow the 2 minute rule on the box you are golden.. perfect if you&#x27;re on the go.. My longest manicure has lasted 5 days with this on, so that&#x27;s pretty good if you ask me! As for dry time, you can&#x27;t get better and at such a great cost!</li>
            <li> I change my nail color almost every single day so my constant concern is screwing up the finish. I also paint my nails in the car (never while driving, of course) and need to have it set by the time I get where I&#x27;m going.  This stuff works wonders. There is no false advertising here or exaggeration about it&#x27;s abilities. It dries 100% firm in 30 seconds, no smudges, no chips, no weird indents, or finger prints. Set.  5 bucks!? Hell yes. Surprisingly, though, I got this for like 4.50 at Target and it is more expensive on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly but you still have to be careful not to bump your nails on anything for a few hours. It is a little thick so it can also cause those pesky air bubbles in your nail polish. Unfortunately my nail polish still chips and doesn&#x27;t stay perfect stay any longer than 4 days. Overall, this top coat does its job.</li>
            <li> I have used Sally Hansen Products for a long time this one does not stay on nails it pops off.</li>
            <li> I have used every nail product known to man, and this is the best instant drier you can buy at an amazing price!! I live overseas, and it is about 13 euros a bottle (about $17.50 at current exchange rates.) I buy several bottles at a time and have them shipped to Europe so I am never without my favorite polish drier!! TRY IT!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works. I painted my nail three minutes ago and I can already function as human being again! I&#x27;ve never written a review or recommended a product before, but I&#x27;m so impressed that I can&#x27;t help myself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently began doing my own manicures to save money. I decided to give this a try because of the positive reviews and I must agree. I use opi base coat then a color coat. I gave 4 stars because I didn&#x27;t see the shine everyone raved about so I used sinful colors too shine coat which makes it really glossy then I waited the 2 minutes and applied this as the final top coat. It dried quickly and I must say it does make ur nail feel thicker. I have tiny hands and tiny thin nails. This is definitely a must have for salon or DIY manicures. No chipping or peeling.</li>
            <li> I  mean it&#x27;s a top coat. I think it works pretty well. I also don&#x27;t expect my nail polish to last for 2 weeks. When they chip, they chip. It helps if you add a little bit of a top coat every few days!! Best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used though!!</li>
            <li> This is far..far from chip resistant. It does dry fast! But seems to go on thickly and chips pretty quickly!</li>
            <li> Great price and function - Since I discovered this product my life has changed! No more ruining my nails after going out of the salon!</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t use this my polish is peeling and chipping hours after I polish my nails. this is so amazing...</li>
            <li> I used this top coat for years, until last year when I picked up a bottle of Seche Vite. The SV certainly dries faster than the Insta Dri, but I was less than half a bottle in and the SV became unbearably thick and gloopy. The massive shrinkage also didn&#x27;t help matters. Teaches me from leaving the Insta Dri! My only gripe is that while this top coat does \\&quot;set within 30 seconds\\&quot;, it doesn&#x27;t actually cure the polish until a few hours in. So if you do your nails right before bed, you will find dents in the morning. Small price to pay for high gloss, no shrinkage, and a mani that lasts for easily 4-5 days.</li>
            <li> Great product it dries nail polish quickly but doesn&#x27;t prevent the polish from chipping.</li>
            <li> This top cost dries super fast and goes on thick. Many people mistake my regular nail polish for a gel manicure when I use this top coat. It&#x27;s my favorite top coat to date.</li>
            <li> Sally HansenÂ´s Insta Dri is the best.  Your nail polish last longer and also protects your nails. it really does the job.  Excellent Choice!</li>
            <li> This polish performed exactly as advertised. I used another nail polish - not fast drying - and used this top coat after waiting a couple of minutes. It worked! The other polish dried immediately, and it&#x27;s one that usually takes forever. I am very satisfied with this inexpensive, high-quality purchase, and will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Oh, I love it!!! I can&#x27;t imagine that it really works. After for 1 minutes your nails with polish become dry. I will buy it again and again.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff, quick drying and a lot of shine</li>
            <li> the best - works just like it says - must have</li>
            <li> Still chipped the next day.</li>
            <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure why I keep receiving duplicates of orders I purchased.  For example, as far as I know, I only ordered one of these and received a quantity of four, and they cannot be returned.  I am beyond frustrated.</li>
            <li> It dries your nails but it makes my nail polish not last as long.</li>
            <li> whenever I paint my nails I put this on as a top coat, and in about 10 minutes my nails are perfectly dry. I love that they become really solid, because I hate walking around trying not to touch anything in fear of messing my nails up. the one thing I will say is it does make my nail polish peel, it wont chip, but if you get nervous and play with your nails, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for you.</li>
            <li> Perfect for drying nail polish quickly--especially for brands like Essie polish that seem to take forever to dry! It smells awful and I&#x27;m sure contains some terrible chemicals but it does do the job.</li>
            <li> Invariably as soon as I manicure my nails, I have to do something that ruins them before the polish is completely dry and set.  When I apply the Sally Hansen Insta Dry, my manicure sets right away and it is a very pretty glossy top coat.  After the first time I bought this, I&#x27;ve kept it in stock all the time.  My sister recommended it to me and she was right.  Great product - recommended.</li>
            <li> If you are like me, a professional manicure destroyer, this will be a lifeline. You swipe, wait 20 seconds, and out the door you go. Also, I&#x27;ve found that it keeps the paint chip free longer, even after days of doing the dishes.</li>
            <li> I use this mot times when I do my nails. I have not experienced a chipping effect, and I love how shiny it makes my nails look - I get compliments. Once when I had very long nails and did a lot of work it cracked and peeled a bit but for the most part it holds pretty well. When a friend does them and uses either nothing or Dry Kwik they seem to chip much faster. I type a lot for my job, so they do get some work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I do think it goes bad relatively quickly- I couldn&#x27;t tell you exactly how old my bottle was when it did, but it was under 2 years old and when the bottle got low it got goopy and much more likely to smudge the manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think dry-kwik dries them faster, but makes them chip easily. This dries them to the touch quickly but they can still gouge for a bit after, so I try not to do anything that will beat them up right away. I&#x27;m also not clear on how much faster it dries than regular nail polish - the other day I had to go without, and my Spoiled brand nail polish (which is only so-so) seemed to dry pretty quickly on it&#x27;s own. However, it lacked the shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like it, although I might experiment with using it vs. not using it and comparing drying times. If the price is too steep for you, I think you can easily skip it. But the shine is nice, and if you&#x27;re going for a top coat, the relatively quick dry time and the lack of shrinking make it a pretty good one.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does dry my nails super quick. I used to have to wait hours before I could do hand intensive chores like dishes or something but now, my nails are totally dry in about 10 minutes. The polish doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long though. It can sometimes start chipping as soon as the next day. I don&#x27;t know if that is the fault of the product or if there&#x27;s something different that I should be doing. I like it though.</li>
            <li> I never ever make time to do my nails. Vanity ranks quite low on my priority list most days. However, since I discovered this gem of a product, I have painted my nails twice. That&#x27;s a 3 year record. It really does dry quick. I can paint them and within 5 minutes continue on being a productive mom.</li>
            <li> I Would no recommend it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It Drys fast if you just want to use it as a single layer coat. However, to apply on top of a color it takes forever to dry, much longer than my old top coat. I was so disappointed. It chip like any other and not shiny at all.</li>
            <li> I love the look of polished nails, whether it&#x27;s color or just shine. What I absolutely hate is that feeling of being held prisoner of my fresh manicure. You can&#x27;t touch your hair, turn the pages of a book, use the computer -- all you can really do is just sit there and pray for the Nail Polish Goddess to finish her work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sally Hansen&#x27;s Instant Dry Topcoat is truly that -- instant dry! It works better than any other topcoat out there, no matter what the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a multi-tasker pressed for time -- and who isn&#x27;t -- you must have this product!</li>
            <li> After one day of doing a full manicure and using this top coat, I was very disappointed. While I was washing dishes, WITH GLOVES ON TO PROTECT MY MANICURE, I took off the gloves to find that my one day old manicure has chipped away!!! I do not recommend this top coat. The only good is requires is shine and fast drying time.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to add to the pile of 5-star reviews this product has gotten. I painted my nails barely 2-3 minutes ago and I&#x27;m already on the computer typing this. My nails really do already feel like they&#x27;ve been dry forever. I don&#x27;t see any nicks or dings and I&#x27;m actually going about my life like I don&#x27;t have wet nails. This is amazing. This product reduced the nearly half hour wait for dry nails (and you know even then they&#x27;re not REALLY dry) down to basically 3 minutes. I&#x27;ve been touching and tapping my nails trying to get them to show a ding but I can&#x27;t. You can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li> Over the past few weeks, I&#x27;ve fallen in love with polishing my nails. It&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve always eschewed, mainly because they&#x27;ve always smudged after I applied the top coat. Drying drops/polishes never seemed to work either. So after reading these reviews, I decided to give this product a try, and WOW, it really works! My manicures are now flawless, super-glossy, and long lasting. Even better, 30 seconds after I&#x27;ve applied this stuff, my nails are dry to the touch. I can type, I can write, I can even grab my coffee mug without fear of wrecking my nails! I love it.    One note of caution: it does take about an hour for all the layers of polish (presuming you&#x27;re using a base coat, 2-3 coats of polish, and a top coat) to fully harden, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend doing major housework/repairs, etc., as your nails WILL smudge. Otherwise, Sally Hansen Insta-Dry is a true miracle product, and I can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
            <li> This top coat dries extremely fast!</li>
            <li> Well, the product is as expected.</li>
            <li> Amazing because you do not need to go to the nail Salam and waste money on someting that can doo at homeð</li>
            <li> Excellent fast drying top coat.  Nails are dry to the touch within one or two minutes.  It gives my manicure a beautiful shine and doesn&#x27;t cause shrinkage like Seche Vite&#x27;s fast drying top coat. Seche Vite gives a higher shine, but causes the nail polish to shrink from the cuticle and nail tip.  This will be my new &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; top coat.</li>
            <li> Do it work? Yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow the 2 minute wait rule before you apply the polish on wet nails. It works well with the Sally Hansen Age Correct polish. Use the Sally Hansen Age Correct over any color and as your base, wait two minutes and apply a coat of this Insta-Dri. I&#x27;m usually careful since it doesn&#x27;t dry solid, it remains soft for a while but the polish doesn&#x27;t remain gooey or wet. It&#x27;s an awesome product!</li>
            <li> Amazing. Drys in seconds. Rock hard and great shine. Wish I knew about this years ago.</li>
            <li> Awesome, though the formula does not seem to go well with the Julep brand.</li>
            <li> Nice product, received quick.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do</li>
            <li> My girlfriend that never used topcoat after painting her nails before called this stuff a &amp;#34;game changer&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love painting my nails and have been stuck on doing my own French manicure lately. I wasn&#x27;t using a top coat per se. I was just using Sally Hansen Diamond Strength hardener as a top coat but that wasn&#x27;t working out all that great ( its not a proper top coat polish i know) My polish was chipping within a day forcing me to do constant touch ups. I got on amazon and decided to give the Sally Hansen insta-dry anti-chip top coat a try. (I also got some good tips from product reviews) I remove all the old polish with polish remover. Wash my hands really well with soap and water. Dry completely. I put a light layer of the diamond strength hardener and let it dry (only takes a few minutes) then I apply whatever color I want. Top it off with the insta-dry anti-chip polish and I&#x27;m good with no chips for a good week or so.&lt;br /&gt;The thing is that the directions say apply nail color. Wait two minutes. Then apply one layer of the top coat and it will dry to the touch in 30 seconds. This is true. IF you only apply one layer of color. If you apply two layer of color and then apply the top coat it&#x27;s not quite dry to the touch in 30 seconds. But when it does set...it sets good. I like it. Leaves my nails hard and super shiney.</li>
            <li> This is a great drying product....I will purchase this product again and again.. Thanks</li>
            <li> If it didn&#x27;t market itself as an anti-chip topcoat it would get 5 stars from me, unfortunately my nailpolish starts chipping by the 2nd DAY!  That is NOT good!    On the plus side, this is the best instant dry polish I have ever bought!!!  It really does dry your nail polish very fast without smudging.    If you are a girl on the go, this is perfect for you.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does work.  I was worried that you could only paint one coat of actual nail polish/color before using this top coat, but in reality I did two coats (pretty thick ones at that), waited the two minutes and boom, dry to the touch.  This is well worth the price seeing as before I would have to literally wait hours for my polish to fully dry or end up accidentally smudging them somehow.  Truly amazing.</li>
            <li> Sally Hansen&#x27;s Instant Dry Topcoat is truly that -- instant dry! It works better than any other topcoat that I bought.</li>
            <li> My husband has problems with chipping almost as soon as he leaves the shop. He puts this on when he gets home and his nails last for two weeks!!!</li>
            <li> I accidentally shattered the bottle of my previous top coat, so I decided to go for an upgrade when I replaced it. Big mistake. I should have stuck with my other top coat (Revlon, nothing fancy at all). I put on my normal base coat, two coats of my nail polish, and then Insta-Dri. I gave it fifteen minutes, which is all I&#x27;d ever needed before to do the finger print test, and was shocked to see that a light touch of my fingertip on the thumb of my other hand seriously smudged my polish. The nail polish was actually tacky to the touch. I was a bit annoyed but redid my nail. I thought that maybe the problem was with my nail polish. The next time I did my nails, I used a polish that I&#x27;d worn a few weeks prior (it dried quickly and without incident the first time). After giving my finished nails 20 minutes to dry, I had the same problem, with my nail polish smudging after it should have been dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From what I&#x27;ve seen, this top coat doesn&#x27;t do what it says.</li>
            <li> Great top coat - it dries very quickly..  I didn&#x27;t time it but it was definitely under 1 minute.  After 3 days my polish is still on whereas usually my polish would chip within 2-3 days using other top coats.  I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great product but it&#x27;s not as &amp;#34;instant&amp;#34; as it claims to be.</li>
            <li> This is probably the worst top coat I have ever used. It does dry super quick, but it does not keep my nails from chipping any more than when I don&#x27;t use a top coat.</li>
            <li> Not very good....chipped almost immediately....</li>
            <li> Looks great, but dries slow for being &amp;#34;instant.&amp;#34; Chips after just a few days.</li>
            <li> I absolutely can&#x27;t live without this product.  Because I do my own mani/pedis I need something that keeps my nail polish on longer and also dries quickly, along with a high gloss finish.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years and this does it ALL!!!</li>
            <li> my nail polish usually starts peeling off especially on the sides on day 2 due to excessive keyboard typing, washing dishes and cooking but not with this top coat&lt;br /&gt;i was skeptical when i saw the product on the shelf first but it was on sale an i thought i&#x27;d give it a try... where has this top coat been all my life?!?!?!&lt;br /&gt;it dries extremely quickly, has a very smooth feel, does not affect the nail polish underneath and protects from chipping like magic. during the first use, after 3-4 days i did notice the front edge of the nail showed some very subtle wear, like the polish was rubbed off, but that was due to the use of my hands, no chipping though, none of the usual bubbling on the sides of the nail, it was perfect, and especially great for feet that are in sandals all day&lt;br /&gt;after 5 days i decided to change the underlying color so i was able to, albeit with some difficulty, peel the polish off my nails rather than have to remove it with acetone.&lt;br /&gt;i plan on using this product with any and all polish from now on&lt;br /&gt;thank you, sally hansen!</li>
            <li> After panting my nails four an hour i was frustrated when they smudged so i went on line and found this just got it today its wonderful it dries in 10 seconds its shiny it like gel polish in love right now</li>
            <li> The best top coat and drys fast.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in this polish. I&#x27;ve never had a Sally polish peel off the same day.</li>
            <li> Does what it claims ! Nailed dry in around 2 mins. I (naively) did try opening a sealed cellophane bag, which dinged two of my nails- but I was really pushing it. Slept on a fresh manicure with this top coat and still shiny impeccable in the AM.</li>
            <li> Sally Hansen brand is cheaper that the more expensive products that you assume will work better, i.e. OPI. This works great, dries clear and quickly. Allows my gel manicure to last 3 weeks</li>
            <li> WHERE HAS THIS BEEN ALL MY LIFE! I mostly use &amp;#34;quick dry&amp;#34; nail polishes, but they STILL smudge easily &amp; I frequently chip my nail polish within the first few hours. This top coat means I can move within a few minutes &amp; chips are WAY less frequent (note: I play dodge ball &amp; other things that wreck nails). This topcoat is super shiny, dries nails fast, &amp; helps polish last longer. I use it with the &amp;#34;hard as nails&amp;#34; base coat.</li>
            <li> Have tried 3 bottles and before I use half the bottle it has gotten too thick to brush on.  If it performed for the whole product use my rating would be better</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic. When they say Insta dry, they aren&#x27;t kidding. I can put this on at night, and in minutes I am in bed , asleep, and wake up with perfect nails because this stuff does such a fantastic job of drying your nails to prevent any damage to them while they are still in the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; phase - it is almost like they eliminated the wet phase altogether. I highly recommend for anyone,  with any polish. It is clear, don&#x27;t let the red bottle fool you - it is like any other clear base or top coat, except it works so much better.</li>
            <li> This product does leave a nice shine on your nail polish.  But if you are always cleaning it will not keep your nail polish from chipping before ten days.  But for the price it is a good product.  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> got the package very early which made me happy; arrived nicely with no damage and works great! would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Helps keep nail polish shiny, but as for it being anti-chip... not so much. It does dry relatively quickly though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m reviewing on my dad&#x27;s account. This bottle has saved my nails from the dreaded bed marks. The only downside is that it isn&#x27;t really 10 days antichip. I put it on, and the next day, it chipped pretty badly on the front part of my index finger. I guess it depends on what you do during the day. But I would highly recommend. Just make sure you don&#x27;t put a thick layer on, because it&#x27;ll take a bit longer to fully dry. Air bubbles aren&#x27;t too much of a problem either, just make sure you smooth the polish down evenly :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the others, and this is the top coat I keep coming back to. It leaves a strong, shiny coat that seems to dry ALL layers quickly; I&#x27;m always surprised by this fact. I&#x27;ll go to bed with nails that would end up with sheet marks if I were wearing any other brand of polish, but this one dries like magic. The top coat is really tough, too--I don&#x27;t notice the chipping I do with other, often more expensive brands. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Tried all the high end top coats and by far this has been the best! I use a mini fan and allow 3 mins drying time between coats and then give a good 7-10 mins after applying this topcoat and my nails never smear or smudge. Polish doesn&#x27;t chip until my next mani( usually 5 days). Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly. You really have to wait 2-3 minuted before putting this on and then another minute before your nails are truly dry.</li>
            <li> A nail chipped, but still pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ts a go.&lt;br /&gt;  Omana</li>
            <li> It dries fast, but peel the following day.</li>
            <li> This really works! I had never used a top coat before this, and I regret not finding this sooner. Now that I have I wanna tell everyone how awesome it is. It does take a little more than 30 seconds, but within 2 minutes it&#x27;s perfect! Try it. It&#x27;s really affordable too.</li>
            <li> I had originally purchased this product because of the reviews that I read on Amazon and unfortunately I have to go against the grain on this one. I felt that though it worked incredibly well as a quick dry my nails would chip almost instantly and my manicure would not last longer than 2 days. Disappointed in the product</li>
            <li> Thes best product I ever had!!!!</li>
            <li> I have never owned a top coat that didn&#x27;t chip within the first 24hrs. I use my hands a lot working around my house and it&#x27;s hard to wear polish because it just flakes off when I wash dishes and such. But with this it is possible! I really does sry in about 30 seconds. I also love that it doesn&#x27;t have a funky color to it. Sometimes I just put it on my bare nails to get a nice shine and it looks terrific and it lasts almost two weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this producto for years, and always has amazing result. I&#x27;ve tried others labels, but this has no match!</li>
            <li> This stuff is freaking awesome! Now, the down side..I&#x27;ve only used it for the first time tonight. So now that that&#x27;s out of the way, I must say that this stuff did what the box says. I already had a manicure that I did a few days ago with a cheapie clear top coat. It was getting pretty dull. I bought this because I plan to redo my manicure this weekend with all the good stuff-OPI no chip base coat, Sally Hansen polish and this top coat. I wanted to test this out on my nails tonight since I was tired of them looking dull. I swear this stuff really dries in seconds. I would say give it about 30 seconds and you can touch your nails. Give it about two minutes and you&#x27;ll be typing on your laptop like I&#x27;m doing now with no worries about smudging. I literally have stopped typing a couple of times to see if I have nicks or smudges, especially on my thumbs, and zilch, nada, nothing. Just perfect shine. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Delivery is really fast. This item does work as far as drying your nails quickly and I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Having used probably dozens of &amp;#34;quick drying&amp;#34; polishes over the years, this one works by far the best. Most top coats dry on the surface only, leaving a wet, gloopy layer below it, so even when it&#x27;s dry to the touch, if you nick your nail, you create a dent or gouge in the polish. This top coat actually dries ALL the way through in just a few minutes!</li>
            <li> Dries instantly, so you can do your nails and not wait around for them to dry. Smudge resistant, and feels like a gel manicure. Doesn&#x27;t chip for days.</li>
            <li> I used this as a base and top coat after one day of wear it chips and flakes off. Water gets under the paint and it flakes right off in chunks!</li>
            <li> My nails are always painted and I have gone through so many products trying to find the \\&quot;one\\&quot;....I must have 15 different top coat polishes.  I got a gel nail kit and absolutely loved it, until I developed an allergic reaction to the polish.  I was so bummed until I stumbled upon this product.  I was AMAZED that I could put this over polish that was painted on just minutes before.  I had doubts it would work, but am SO glad I gave it a shot.  It dries within a few minutes....not a kind of dry that you can scratch your nail and not cause damage, but a kind of dry that you can actually do things and not cause damage to the polish.  It seems to completely harden after 10 minutes.  I also love the high shine this polish gives.  I painted my nails 4 days ago and I have NO chips in my polish and I&#x27;m hard on my hands (I&#x27;m a police officer and mother of 3 little ones).  I just bought this polish for a good friend and my entire book club...it&#x27;s that good :-)</li>
            <li> I love this top coat! It&#x27;s so hard to find a good one without having to spend a fortune. This is one of them! will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery which I love. It does dry your nails fast. I love it.</li>
            <li> I totally love this top coat. It dries very fast , give nails a lot of shine and keep the color intact very long</li>
            <li> Sally Hansen has always been a respected name in beauty supplies, so I bought this with every expectation that it would perform well. However, I am greatly disappointed in this top coat product. It does dry the nails quickly, but it also chips the polish within hours, not days of wear. I thought it was me being over active the first time (washing hands frequently, household chores, etcetera) it happened with my first nail polish color. I tried the polish again without the top coat and I managed to get to day 4 before I saw a little chip. I used it again with another brand and color polish and the same thing happened; before the day was done I had multiple noticeable chips.&lt;br /&gt; I am not upset because I didn&#x27;t spend a lot for this, but I do feel that I wasted money. I will not buy this product again and I am rethinking Sally Hansen products going forward.</li>
            <li> I love this top coat but I wish it didn&#x27;t get so thick as you got toward the end of the bottle.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST top coat that you&#x27;ll ever find!  Not only does it dry any nail polish within minutes, it also protects your manicure better so that it will last for almost a week without chipping!  LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!!!  Can&#x27;t rave enough about it.</li>
            <li> This stuff dries so fast that as you&#x27;re polishing, it is already drying-so polish quickly! The shine is GREAT. Lasts for several days and truly makes it so you can move on with your day almost immediately. Love love love it!</li>
            <li> Definitely one of the best top coats I&#x27;ve tried. It does work on drying the nail polish faster, although I think it doesn&#x27;t help much on preventing early chipping.</li>
            <li> Just love Sally Hansen Insta Dry, Chip top Coat, it makes my nail polish dry fast and last forever&amp;#62; I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My favorite Sally Hansen top coat.  It seems to be a bit shinier than the Dries Instantly so I like it a bit better.</li>
            <li> are you kidding? Buy the stuff now! How are you living without it? Life happens, use this stuff and you&#x27;ll be ready for it.</li>
            <li> This product stained my wife&#x27;s nails! Even after she took it off her nails were still reddish. She will never buy this product again!</li>
            <li> Finally a nail product that lives up to its name . . . Insta-Dri.  You simply apply your base and color coats and then apply Insta-Dri and your nails are dry and you can actually return to life!  It is marvelous!  As of yet I haven&#x27;t kept the shine and no-chip feature for ten whole days . . . I still haven&#x27;t found any product to do that other than possibly acrylics but even they don&#x27;t keep shine for ten days.  But this product&#x27;s PRIMARY claim is INSTA-DRI and that it absolutely does.  It is a good, solid dry set; enough so that you can return amongst the living.  Fabulous product and a must-have for all nail buffs (pun intended).  Great for polishing the nails of young girls who can&#x27;t sit still for more than about a minute.  Great for polishing toe nails in colder climates in the winter so that you can get your socks back on before your feet freeze!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best top coat products.</li>
            <li> They MEAN &amp;#34;insta-dri&amp;#34; and love that! Not too certain it&#x27;s helped all that much with chips, but then again, I&#x27;m hard on my nails, so...</li>
            <li> This is remarkably effective stuff.  It doesnât work a miracle in quite 30 seconds as it claims, especially if you are putting it over a layer of primer and two layers of polish, but in less than five minutes your finish is remarkably hard.  It shortens the time you have to walk around worrying about what you touch so  you donât ding your nail polish.</li>
            <li> This product really works!&lt;br /&gt;It dries quickly and keeps my nail polish from chipping.&lt;br /&gt;I painted my nail 4 days ago and it&#x27;s still in perfect shape!&lt;br /&gt;Usually my polish would chip after 2-3 days.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really impressed !&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> The instance dri work terrifically. the best product I have ever used for drying nails.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best topcoat I&#x27;ve used - it dries quickly (within 30 seconds) and gives your nails a shiny finish. I&#x27;d  definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Not sure how this is not a problem for others, but I&#x27;ve tried this product twice and on both occasions my OPI nail polish (that on its own lasts 4-5 days minimum), with this top coat is getting peeled off the following day. It&#x27;s pretty ironic that the title of this product says Anti-chip. Looks like I&#x27;m better off without this top coat. Just disappointed that I&#x27;ve spent over $7 on this.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this Sally Hansen product. She loves it. She says it really works. She always use it for her nails and manicure keeps fine for 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I got something called &amp;#34;night flight&amp;#34; instead of what I was expecting. Maybe there was a mixup with orders. Have no idea what happened.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff at the store not here online but I thought I would share my thoughts any way. I always have trouble with chipping my nails so I needed something that was going to keep that from happening. I am a photographer so all people see is my hands however the job is hard on them sometimes. So I bought this stuff and it works great. My only complaint is that it does not set your manicure in 30 seconds. More like 2-4 mins. I mean they are dry to the touch but I totally smeared a nail because I thought they would be drier than they were. So I would wait a couple mins not 30 seconds. Other than that its a great product. Very shiny top coat and keeps my nails from chipping. Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> Love this Top Coat! Does what it say&#x27;s it will do... Can&#x27;t believe l payed close to 10$ for essie \\&quot;no chip&#x27;s ahead top coat\\&quot; and it did nothing for me, by the third day it left my nails matte and also with air bubbles in the finish.. And forget about the \\&quot;no chips ahead\\&quot; part!!! But l have  none of those problems no more with Sally Hansen Insta-Dri top coat! This product WORKS!!! leaves a nice shine... Wished l had known about this years ago!....p.s. No top coat is going to fully dry your nail polish BUT this one will make your nails touch dry so you will not AFRAID to go about your life... Will by AGAIN!!!!:)</li>
            <li> This is one of those products that you&#x27;ll kick yourself for not using/finding earlier.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a game changer for three reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1. It evens out your polish and gives you a super shiny finish. Streaks and smudges disappear once applied.&lt;br /&gt;2. It makes your manicure last longer. I use my nails as tools and wash a lot of dishes. I can still get a good 4-5 days out of my polish when I use this topcoat. (Without, I&#x27;m lucky to get 24 hours before chips.)&lt;br /&gt;3. The best reason you need this now, if ONLY for this reason: You can sleep without smudging your fresh nails (fingers OR toes) 15 minutes after applying. It takes longer to fully set but you don&#x27;t have to worry about sheet marks.  And you only have to wait 5 minutes (I think the bottle says less) before applying after your last coat of color so manicures happen very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m constantly buying and giving away my bottle of this top coat. It&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> Prior to finding this product, I&#x27;d gotten to where I assumed I&#x27;d never be able to keep up a decent manicure.  I&#x27;m hard on my hands, and this is the only product I&#x27;ve found that can get my manicures to last more than 24 hrs.  I&#x27;ve tried many, many others, including salon brands, and this is what&#x27;s worked best for me - I can now get through a whole week without having my polish chipped to the point of embarrassment!  Goes on SO smoothly and evenly, dries quickly to a super-glossy shine.  Absolutely worth it!!</li>
            <li> I paint and decorate my nails a couple of times a week. I love nail art! Although this top coat dries very fast my nails still start chipping the next day. I always file the edges of my nails, buff them, scrub them and use nail polish remover before I begin painting. This top coat does not keep polish on. If you only want to spiff up your nails for a night out and are in a rush for drying time I would recommend it. For long lasting polish I wouldn&#x27;t. It sometimes leaves a whitish bubbly appearance as well which is frustrating to have when you spend so much time carefully painting and decorating.  I am going to try a sticky base coat soon and am hoping this helps with this problem of chipping polish the next day after painting. Hope it helps because this product doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This is great for the instant dry feature but it does not prevent chipping.  I use this on top of my nail color and my polish still chips.</li>
            <li> Love this!  It works well! You won&#x27;t be disappointed. I use it as my only top coat and I use opi no chip as the base coat.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this stuff! It really is dry to touch in 30 seconds, but I like to give it a full 2 or 3 minutes before doing anything. I never want to be without this topcoat.</li>
            <li> I work in a dog grooming salon. As a result of this my nails often get chipped, cracked, scratched, peeled, ground off with the nail grinder...all those nice things. But I still love to paint and care for my nails. My biggest qualm with the whole process is waiting for everything to dry! Last night I did a rainbow sponged manicure, two hours before bed...and this morning I woke up with half of them smeared and embossed with lines from my blanket/pillow. I hate it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I purchased this top coat, Sally Hanson Insta-Dri and brought it home to use on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put down two coats of my main color (I didn&#x27;t use a base coat this time but I normally do), added two coats of sparkle polish, and then (after waiting two minutes) put this top coat on. It really is dry to the touch after a minute or so. It is still susceptible to dents and other marks so I would recommend waiting *at least* ten to fifteen minutes before doing anything that might mark up your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good test to see if your nails are truly dry is to VERY gently touch two of your nails together. If the polish is even a little tacky, is not completely dry and will most likely be marked/dented/damaged somehow if you mess around with them! But at least with this top coat I can type on my computer, use a gaming controller or do other simple things that I wasn&#x27;t able to do before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This top coat is very shiny, even after just one coat. I really like that about it. Before I was using Spoiled&#x27;s top coat and it took 2-3 coats to look this nice, and about 20x longer to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nails are quite brittle and thin, no matter what I do to help them get stronger, so I don&#x27;t expect this to save them from chipping. If I can keep the majority of my color on my nails for a few days, I&#x27;ll be happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this particular product to dry my nails more quickly, and that&#x27;s what it does, so I&#x27;m happy with my purchase! The price is very reasonable for what it is, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: It&#x27;s been three days and the only real chips I&#x27;ve had to my manicure were self-inflicted, one with a nail grinder and another when I broke a small part of my nail off on a wooden door. This top coat is holding up wonderfully!r /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: It&#x27;s been three days and the only real chips I&#x27;ve had to my manicure were self-inflicted, one with a nail grinder and another when I broke a small part of my nail off on a wooden door. This top coat is holding up wonderfully!</li>
            <li> I bought this at a whim in Rite Aid and I LOVE IT.  It dries my nails very fast which I appreciate because my nails always get messed up as soon as I go to sleep.  Even when I think they&#x27;re dry, they&#x27;re not fully dry and of course get messed up.  This fixes that for me.  It dries the nail polish in under 10 minutes and keeps them glossy looking and kind of like the gel manicures at the salons.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This is the best Top Coat i&#x27;ve ever used. Dries really fast and prevent from chipping. My nails stay perfect for much longer now!!!</li>
            <li> Dries within seconds of application and protects nails from chipping and breaking for more than a week if you want. I usually change color by then. I won&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, nice price. It came perfect</li>
            <li> Made my polish dry quickly but kinda made it crack. It didn&#x27;t seem to have any effect on how quickly my nails chipped either.</li>
            <li> This works really well. The gloss isnt superior but it gets the job done. One coat is all you need. Ot dries the outer layer not the whole paint job fully through though.</li>
            <li> my nail polish dried right away after putting this on and my nails have not chipped yet after having the polish on for 4 days. i have tried my polish before without this product and it chipped the next day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used two top coats - Seche Vite and this one and I find Seche Vite to be better for me. The drying time of this top coat is comparable to that of Seche Vite and the shine is pretty nice too. However, I can&#x27;t use it for nail art. If my nail isn&#x27;t already completely dry, it streaks. And sometimes it streaks on some of my polish even though it&#x27;s dry. And then my designs are ruined :(  So I have to wait a long while to put on the top coat. In my experience, seche vite does not streak and I can use it on wet nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike Seche Vite, it doesn&#x27;t shrink my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it doesn&#x27;t deserve 5 stars. I would give it 3.5 stars.</li>
            <li> This thing is not worth your money! Save it &amp; buy a better top coat! I applied this 4 times already &amp; I keep thinking maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong when I apply it but it chips the same day I apply it! It&#x27;s suppose to be no chip polish &amp; that&#x27;s the only thing it does .. I would give it 0 stars but that isn&#x27;t possible so one will do.</li>
            <li> my holy grail, dries in no time and great price.  I cannot do without this.</li>
            <li> Like it!  Great top coat and really does dry fast!</li>
            <li> It works, i whole week withou a chip</li>
            <li> Dried quickly which is a plus when you paint your nails before bed. Also it doesn&#x27;t get bubbles and doesn&#x27;t chip. It also last pretty long. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> it dries your nails in seconds, if you are in a rush this product is perfect, nails never damage, recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other topcoats, including the much-raved-about Seche Vite (which just made my polishes peel within a day). I always end up back with Sally Hansen. My nails end up shiny and dry within 30 seconds, and there&#x27;s no chipping or peeling. I love being able to function so quickly after painting my nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This topcoat does get glumpy when it&#x27;s about 2/3 gone, though. If I try and use it, my nails end up with insane amount of bubbles. I usually put thinner in to make this useable again, but there tends to be a few bubbles even when I do that. But until that point, it&#x27;s a great topcoat.</li>
            <li> Essie bonding base coat to adhere the polish to the nail, orly bonding coat are the best. Just get a dry quick top coat. I can&#x27;t stand sally hansen anymore. I&#x27;m discovering how flawed their nail polish is. And i had it all.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  I have learned that if I apply a thick coat of the polish (a blob, really) it seems to set up faster.  I apply it before my color coat is completely dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see some say it causes peeling, or does not dry in 30 seconds.  I have not had issues with peeling, but I do note it only dries to the touch in 30 seconds.  However, I have painted my nails, waited 15 minutes, and then done housework without a smudge or mishap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this product, I can change my nail polish at night while watching TV, then wake up in the morning without sheet-prints on my fresh polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take it to the nail salon when I get pedicures because it dries so much faster than the top coats at the salon.  The nail techs seem to like it, too.</li>
            <li> Very nice product, does what it says. Nice, glossy finish. It&#x27;s dry to the touch after 30 seconds (set, but not completely dry all the way through), and you&#x27;re ready to get back to scratching your butt after a few minutes, with little or now chance of smudging. I am a total product junkie, always looking for an excuse to try something new, but I will definitely be sticking to this topcoat.</li>
            <li> Dries fast. But dont last. Nail polish chip a day afterwards :(</li>
            <li> Based on some reviews for this top coat I bought it.  I found it works no better than any other top coat I&#x27;ve used, regardless of brand.</li>
