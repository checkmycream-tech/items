    <ol>
            <li>works great!!!!</li>
            <li>perfect for skin as well as hair.</li>
            <li>Great product!  </li>
            <li>In summer it is the best.</li>
            <li>This butter smells wonderful and the texture is amazing!</li>
            <li>however it works as a great alternative sealant to Shea butter.</li>
            <li>The best to make your own creams, got lot of experience, spec.</li>
            <li>Very nice price and great product.</li>
            <li>Maybe it will be good to just use by itself</li>
            <li>I had read research that this product with Argan oil was the best conditioner for hair and it seems to be true.  </li>
            <li>It is like glycerine but stronger, and has no odor whatsoever, which I love!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>I purchased this to make my own sealant for my daughters hair.</li>
            <li>I make my own skin balms, lotions, and salves and this will be a lovely ingredient.</li>
            <li>Will purchase more.</li>
            <li>Love the scent.  </li>
            <li>I love this cupuacu butter.</li>
            <li>I had also tried some others from another company, and this one was my favorite.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s safe to say I will never buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li>Highly moisturizing, great shine on my skin (body -- not face).</li>
            <li>I was able to order from a competitor that uses a screw lid and everything was fine.</li>
            <li>With my new line of hair product, this oil is so good for your hair.</li>
            <li>The first time most of the product was still in the container, so I was able to use it.</li>
            <li>I made a combo butter with this as part of the mix and it mixed great</li>
            <li>Please, have it available, because now my skin and hair need it every day.</li>
            <li>very moisturizing!!!</li>
            <li>I am so excited about it that I woke up to write this review.  </li>
            <li>but I just don&#x27;t like it as much as my original.</li>
            <li>:  you can use it as a stand-alone serum, better to be covered with a oil on top, or can be just mixed into to whatever moisturizer you use for the face.  </li>
            <li>I have Cupuacu butter from a different seller and I love the texture a lot more.</li>
            <li>It works amazingggg, just amazing, when mixed in with my hair cream.  </li>
            <li>just really hope that this becomes mainstream so that it will always be available.  </li>
            <li>I loved this product so much that I re-ordered it again in double the amount.  </li>
            <li>Arrived in the cutest little bucket, product is just what I needed and of good quality.  </li>
            <li>It did take two washes to get out of my hair though and looked like Gericurl that first day.  </li>
            <li>I love this product; it is especially helpful for inflamed or irritated skin.  </li>
            <li>First time using this product.  </li>
            <li>This is really a 6-star product!</li>
            <li>So, just like any purely moisturizing agent, it needs to be &amp;#34;tied down&amp;#34; with some oil to protect it from evaporation.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>The product is real but refined.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>If you use it just by itself, it will stay amazing only for a few hours and then dries out.  </li>
            <li>Truly is a good hair product and it only takes a very small bit.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t not freeze to hard pieces, it becomes more buttery.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin, and this is going to replace my usual mask, because I put it on my face last night and immediately felt amazing!  </li>
            <li>I have been using it mixed in with my body lotion and body oil, and it really visibly adds moisture to the skin.  </li>
            <li>but it seems old and expired.</li>
            <li>Ok, so you can use it everywhere on your body for moisture and it give unbelievable results!  </li>
            <li>Will definitely purchase again, I use in DIY Natural hair products.</li>
            <li>My hair is partially colored and it makes a real difference in it&#x27;s condition..</li>
            <li>, it is just crazy good.  </li>
            <li>I had problems mixing it with other butters and oils, it was too thick, but it did not have a loud scent which is important.</li>
            <li>It is very expensive but works good when mixed with oils as a sealant.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> My daughter has type 4 coily hair which will dry out instantly and become brittle if I use products with a Shea butter.</li>

            <li> Hard to melt. I purchased to use as a hair conditioner - but instead use as a body lotion as the melting process is too long and impacts the quality of the product. Highly moisturizing, great shine on my skin (body -- not face).</li>
            <li> works great!!!! stops dry skin and scalp instantly.  you can add it to other products.  conditions for a long time.</li>
            <li> Very nice price and great product. Will definitely purchase again, I use in DIY Natural hair products. Will purchase more.</li>
            <li> I had problems mixing it with other butters and oils, it was too thick, but it did not have a loud scent which is important. Maybe it will be good to just use by itself</li>
            <li> Not sure what he problem is, but twice I&#x27;ve ordered this product in two different weights, and both times the product was melted. The first time most of the product was still in the container, so I was able to use it. The second time it was completely melted and had gotten into other products in the box. I&#x27;m more disappointed in the container used as opposed to the product. I was able to order from a competitor that uses a screw lid and everything was fine. Not melted at all.</li>
            <li> I had a store bought conditioner with this in it.  Of course they cancelled it so I wanted to try this ingredient alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for hair and skin.  It did take two washes to get out of my hair though and looked like Gericurl that first day.  It is also solid like they say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need a suggestion about how to make this supple without having to heat it before every shower.</li>
            <li> Hardly use it, it is way to hard.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.  Love the scent.  Use it in place of cocoa butter when I want a body butter with a milder scent.</li>
            <li> I love this cupuacu butter. I had also tried some others from another company, and this one was my favorite.</li>
            <li> You only need about a hlaf a teaspoon to add to your  Shea Butter Skin Cream mixture.</li>
            <li> Arrived in the cutest little bucket, product is just what I needed and of good quality.  I make my own skin balms, lotions, and salves and this will be a lovely ingredient.</li>
            <li> very moisturizing!!! perfect for skin as well as hair.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I use this in my homemade body and hair butters.  This butter smells wonderful and the texture is amazing!</li>
            <li> With my new line of hair product, this oil is so good for your hair.</li>
            <li> Truly is a good hair product and it only takes a very small bit.  I had read research that this product with Argan oil was the best conditioner for hair and it seems to be true.  My hair is partially colored and it makes a real difference in it&#x27;s condition..</li>
            <li> I love this product; it is especially helpful for inflamed or irritated skin.  It soothes the skin in an hour or so and there is no pain afterwards.  I loved this product so much that I re-ordered it again in double the amount.  I will never be without it.&lt;br /&gt;jm</li>
            <li> First time using this product.  Blends we&#x27;ll with other butters. This product has no scent; therefore, absorbs all essential oil scents you choose to use with it.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I made a combo butter with this as part of the mix and it mixed great and I use it for my body &amp; hair</li>
            <li> I purchased this to make my own sealant for my daughters hair. My daughter has type 4 coily hair which will dry out instantly and become brittle if I use products with a Shea butter. This is not a miracle butter however it works as a great alternative sealant to Shea butter. It is very expensive but works good when mixed with oils as a sealant. I use this everyday with no build up and will be buying it again in the future.</li>
            <li> The best to make your own creams, got lot of experience, spec. with my face. In summer it is the best.</li>
            <li> This is really a 6-star product! I am so excited about it that I woke up to write this review.  Ok, so you can use it everywhere on your body for moisture and it give unbelievable results!  Face+Body+Hair.  Face:  you can use it as a stand-alone serum, better to be covered with a oil on top, or can be just mixed into to whatever moisturizer you use for the face.  I have very dry skin, and this is going to replace my usual mask, because I put it on my face last night and immediately felt amazing!  Well, I woke up this morning and my face is like silk and so moisturized, it is just crazy good.  Body:  I have been using it mixed in with my body lotion and body oil, and it really visibly adds moisture to the skin.  It is like glycerine but stronger, and has no odor whatsoever, which I love! Then, I have been trying it for my hair, by itself and mixed with the hair cream and leave-in conditioner.  It works amazingggg, just amazing, when mixed in with my hair cream.  If you use it just by itself, it will stay amazing only for a few hours and then dries out.  So, just like any purely moisturizing agent, it needs to be &amp;#34;tied down&amp;#34; with some oil to protect it from evaporation.&lt;br /&gt;I just really hope that this becomes mainstream so that it will always be available.  Please, have it available, because now my skin and hair need it every day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s safe to say I will never buy from this seller again. The product is real but refined. I don&#x27;t necessarily mind but it was so oily.  I have Cupuacu butter from a different seller and I love the texture a lot more. This product was like oil and froze to hard bits when cold, the other one from a different seller is literally butter. It doesn&#x27;t not freeze to hard pieces, it becomes more buttery. I guess this is what I get for trying to get it for a bit cheaper. The product is packaged horribly. What is this tub and why is the butter broken into piece that don&#x27;t even fill up the tub? The tub smells like paint and is not mixing well with the cocoa scent. I&#x27;m not sure I will be keeping it. If I do I may just use it on my skin and that&#x27;s it but it seems old and expired. Granted it absorbs well but I just don&#x27;t like it as much as my original. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s wrong with it.</li>
            <li> I use this in my homemade lotion and I love it!</li>
    </ol>
