            <li>Well worth the money.</li>

            <li>The mat is thick, comfortable, and has good traction.</li>
            <li>The other girls in the salon loved it so much that they also purchased one.</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed!</li>
            <li>This was the first time i have used Amazon.</li>
            <li>and it really helped a lot, also love the fact that it is square and not traditionally round it gives it a modern touch and complimented his studio.</li>
            <li>She loved it, and last night I finally walked on it</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that is does not sweep up very good.</li>
            <li>This mat is so comfortable and really helps to save her back while she is on her feet all day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this almost one year and is still holding up very well.</li>
            <li>I have never had a fatigue floor mat show up so much dirt.</li>
            <li>Everyone in the salon wants one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much thicker than I anticipated.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable standing on with my long hours.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, highly reccomended</li>
            <li>It has a nice thick cushion.</li>
            <li>It is more of a soft black color</li>
            <li>I wish it was just a little bigger but still a nice mat.</li>
            <li>I ordered 6 of these for my new Salon and that got delayed</li>
            <li>Guess its time for a new one soon.</li>
            <li>Very soft.</li>
            <li>We move around the chair or stand more right behind chair.</li>
            <li>love it, no more back/leg pains...</li>
            <li>The owner reimbursed me for mine and purchased ten more for other stations.</li>
            <li>Outside of it slightly raising on the edges, it&#x27;s an okay buy.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this mat is the gaps around the sides, it lifts a little too much and hair gets under, should have more grip to the floor.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it is saving my legs and back!!</li>
            <li>These really are back and knee savers.</li>
            <li>I run a busy shop and this matt has held up well.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is hair gets under it very easy.</li>
            <li>so I expected them to hold up a little better.</li>
            <li>Extremely thick, I cut hair 10 hours a day, my feet and back feel much better after working on thinner mats for the last 13 years.</li>
            <li>This mat is so thick and comfortable.</li>
            <li>The padding is thick and comfortable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how durable it is since I&#x27;ve only used it a short time, but it looks to be quite strong.</li>
            <li>It is really thick and has helped tremendously with my foot, leg and back pain.  </li>

            <li> It is really thick and has helped tremendously with my foot, leg and back pain.  </li>
            <li> The other girls in the salon have commented on how soft it is, and are asking where they can get one.</li>
            <li> I can wear heels for a lot longer on the mat and the heel marks don&#x27;t last long on the mat.</li>
            <li> Easy to sweep hair off of and looks expensive.</li>
            <li> Mat&#x27;s on;y about a year and a half old</li>
            <li> Very thick and comfortable on my feet, I sometimes work 12 hrs a day behind the chair and this has helped me out so much with fatigue in my feet legs and even my back.</li>
            <li> It is very disappointing because we loved the thickness of these mats.</li>
            <li> After a day of cutting hair my feet and legs feel better than they did before I bought this mat.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it that long</li>
            <li> I sent multiple pictures of all the damages, scratch and tear marks on these and the seller stated &amp;#34; Those imperfections are all on the bottom of the mat and are due to the manufacturing  </li>
            <li> They are not made of a quality that lasts very long.</li>
            <li> Will definitely have to wipe it down often but</li>
            <li> My only major complaint with the mat is that it is starting to develop little cracks around the areas I stand on a majority of the time.</li>
            <li> They all come stand on it and are jealous of the price I spent compared to them.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend, he&#x27;s a very busy stylist and is constantly on his feet, he has bad knees and after work would mention that they were sore, so i surprised him with this mat</li>
            <li> My wife is a salon owner with three other girls.</li>
            <li> The mate is very thick and soft under your feet.  </li>
            <li> I stead of dark black.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t check/inspect these within the the 14 day period and was shocked beyond disbelief when I first opened them and on seeing the damage and imperfections on these Mats.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and cushiony!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed whit this mat , I work in a salon , and my mat star a little gap and keep getting.</li>
            <li> Mine was all wrong  :(</li>
            <li> Wish it didn&#x27;t leave foot prints so badly.</li>
            <li> or if you use it elsewhere, you just have to work around the semicircle that is meant for a chair with a circular base.</li>
            <li> It is very annoying</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I absolutely love this mat!  It is the softest mat in the shop.  This is a great value for the price and I would definately order it again!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my new floor mat!  It is really thick and has helped tremendously with my foot, leg and back pain.  Several of my customers have even made comments about it when they step onto it.  I definitely recommend this mat and it was by far the best price I found for the quality!</li>
            <li> Received my salon mat quickly and in good shape. It works perfectly for my needs and looks great too. Nice and cushiony under my feet.</li>
            <li> Was great support for feet!!!</li>
            <li> Shipped quick and was in perfect condition. I&#x27;ve had this almost one year and is still holding up very well. Doesnt wrinkle, scuff and is the perfect size. Best money spent for something as good quality as this.</li>
            <li> Best mat ever! Everyone in my salon loves my mat. They all come stand on it and are jealous of the price I spent compared to them.</li>
            <li> My husband absolutely love this!!!</li>
            <li> It has a nice thick cushion. It&#x27;s wonderful to stand on all day! I wish it was just a little bigger but still a nice mat.</li>
            <li> The mat is just as supportive as it said it was. I can wear heels for a lot longer on the mat and the heel marks don&#x27;t last long on the mat. Easy to sweep hair off of and looks expensive.</li>
            <li> I PURCHASED THIS ITEM FOR MY DAUGHTER.  SHE IS A BARBER, AND WAS SUFFERING FROM SWELLING LEGS.  SHE SAID THE MAT LOOKS GREAT.  AND THE 1ST WEEKEND SHE WORKED, SHE DID NOT GET THE SWELLING IN HER LEGS.  SO THIS PRODUCT FOR THE MONEY IS WORTH IT.  SHE ALSO SAID SHE GETS LOTS OF COMPLIMENTS ON THE MAT AND IT&#x27;S APPEARANCE.  I WASN&#x27;T SURE HOW IT WAS GONNA WORK OUT BECAUSE OF THE PRICE, I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE CHEAP.  BUT NOT SO.  IT IS WAS A GREAT PURCHASE!!</li>
            <li> Very comfortable to stand on.  Protects my floor well.  My only complaint is that is does not sweep up very good.</li>
            <li> Best mat for the money. Extremely thick, I cut hair 10 hours a day, my feet and back feel much better after working on thinner mats for the last 13 years. My knees had to adjust to the difference though.  Will recommend to anyone looking for a thick mat at a great price!.....update: December 13,2014....I bought two of these mats and they both start cracking. It looks as if someone took a knife and cut it. They are both doing it in the same spot, back left hand side. It is very annoying becsuse i actually trip over it now. We don&#x27;t stand in one spot when we cut. We move around the chair or stand more right behind chair. It is very disappointing because we loved the thickness of these mats. Of course they only have a one year warranty so they are no longer covered. I would not buy these mats again. They are not made of a quality that lasts very long. I will spend a little more money on a mat that is hopefully better quality and has a better warranty.</li>
            <li> I love this mat and glad that I purchased it. It&#x27;s comfortable standing on with my long hours. Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This mat was not verry comfortable for me. I suggest not purchasing this nat from this company because if you need to return this item it will cost you more than the purchase price. I am stuck with a mat that I can not use.</li>
            <li> This is the best mat I&#x27;ve ever used, out of all the shops I&#x27;ve worked in. I&#x27;m exceptionally satisfied with this product, so much so I&#x27;ve purchased 4 of them to use in my shop....</li>
            <li> I can jump on this thing like it&#x27;s a bed almost. Has definitely helped with leg pain</li>
            <li> It has a blue logo on it that I didn&#x27;t k ow about until I got it. I have never had a fatigue floor mat show up so much dirt. The texture of what it is made our of shows up everything. It is more of a soft black color I stead of dark black.</li>
            <li> The mats are really nice when you&#x27;re going to be standing up all day. These really are back and knee savers. My only major complaint with the mat is that it is starting to develop little cracks around the areas I stand on a majority of the time. Mat&#x27;s on;y about a year and a half old so I expected them to hold up a little better. That said I would by it again.</li>
            <li> This mat is so thick and comfortable. Well worth the money. Its the best mat I have ever used and I have been using them since 1986.</li>
            <li> I ordered 6 of these for my new Salon and that got delayed so I didn&#x27;t check/inspect these within the the 14 day period and was shocked beyond disbelief when I first opened them and on seeing the damage and imperfections on these Mats. I sent multiple pictures of all the damages, scratch and tear marks on these and the seller stated &amp;#34; Those imperfections are all on the bottom of the mat and are due to the manufacturing  process&amp;#34;.....They agreed to accept them back but would not pay for the shipping costs to return them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE CHECK THESE AS SOON AS YOU GET THEM !!</li>
            <li> Very comfortable. I would defiantly recommend this to a friend. This item was better than i expect it to be</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and cushiony! I can stand on it all day and it helps my feet and back. Everyone in the salon wants one.</li>
            <li> Had my mat almost two years, finally cracked. That aside its a great saver on my feet.  I love this thing. Guess its time for a new one soon.</li>
            <li> The mat is thick, comfortable, and has good traction. After a day of cutting hair my feet and legs feel better than they did before I bought this mat. A good investment!</li>
            <li> Perfect padding and perfect for the salon or if you use it elsewhere, you just have to work around the semicircle that is meant for a chair with a circular base.</li>
            <li> This is a very comfortable stylist mat I stand some days for over 10 hours and what a differnce this makes!</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and super product! Definitely recommend! As a dog groomer, I am standing all day at my grooming table. These matts are super cushy and easy to clan.</li>
            <li> This product is just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This product has been great for my legs! My co workers are jealous. I haven&#x27;t had it that long so I don&#x27;t know about it&#x27;s durabilaty, but so far so good!</li>
            <li> The matt that i recieved was not the matt that i ordered. Evidentely this went through a third party distributator Dicount Jungle. When i tryed to get the matt i ordered, they never replied back. Very dissapointed! This was the first time i have used Amazon. Probly wont again. However all the stylist i work with ordered the same matt and got the one they wanted. It was the one i wanted as well. Their matt was the right measurements and good quality. Mine was all wrong  :(</li>
            <li> I love this mat. I bought it for one of my stylist.&lt;br /&gt;I bought for my station the kurative mat. I paid about $250.&lt;br /&gt;I put this mat next to mine, the color is lighter&lt;br /&gt;But the same thickness. Great for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I just bought two more.</li>
            <li> Great mat! Very good cushion. Wish it didn&#x27;t leave foot prints so badly. Will definitely have to wipe it down often but great mat, great look &amp; great price!</li>
            <li> Outside of it slightly raising on the edges, it&#x27;s an okay buy.</li>
            <li> Very soft. Good size.</li>
            <li> This mate is thicker than we anticipated.  The mate is very thick and soft under your feet.  Very good for standing for long periods of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes Yes I would recommend it to anyone who needs to be confortable while standing.  Well worht the price!!!!</li>
            <li> I run a busy shop and this matt has held up well. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Very good mat that covers a large area.  The padding is thick and comfortable. Very nice for the price it standing for long periods.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed whit this mat , I work in a salon , and my mat star a little gap and keep getting. Big and big&lt;br /&gt;And not warranty !i lost my money ,,</li>
            <li> Very thick and comfortable on my feet, I sometimes work 12 hrs a day behind the chair and this has helped me out so much with fatigue in my feet legs and even my back. Very very much worth it and its cheaper than others you can buy at the suppliers. Very quick shipping and delivery. My only complaint is hair gets under it very easy. Easier than others I have used. Otherwise, highly reccomended</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend, he&#x27;s a very busy stylist and is constantly on his feet, he has bad knees and after work would mention that they were sore, so i surprised him with this mat and it really helped a lot, also love the fact that it is square and not traditionally round it gives it a modern touch and complimented his studio.</li>
            <li> My wife is a salon owner with three other girls. This mat is so comfortable and really helps to save her back while she is on her feet all day. The other girls in the salon loved it so much that they also purchased one. Great price too!!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my favorite barber… She loved it, and last night I finally walked on it and I can see why! Wonderfully cushiony soft!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a busy stylist, and found this mat incredible for the price. It&#x27;s much thicker than I anticipated. I&#x27;m not sure how durable it is since I&#x27;ve only used it a short time, but it looks to be quite strong. The other girls in the salon have commented on how soft it is, and are asking where they can get one. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Really happy with this mat! The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this mat is the gaps around the sides, it lifts a little too much and hair gets under, should have more grip to the floor.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it is saving my legs and back!!</li>
            <li> love it, no more back/leg pains...my coworkers and clients can&#x27;t believe how affordable it was</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy to have gotten this product.  The owner reimbursed me for mine and purchased ten more for other stations.</li>
