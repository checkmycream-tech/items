            <li>the smell is nice , I will get more if is work</li>
            <li>I love the way this lotion made my skin feel, but didn&#x27;t see &amp;#34;soy&amp;#34; in the ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Love this moisturizer</li>
            <li>I love St Ives lotions - the odor is not overpowering &amp;</li>
            <li>My skin drinks it up and it makes my skin look and feel so healthy.</li>
            <li>St Ives Mineral Therapy lotion is the most intensive moisturizing body lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Nothing stunning.</li>
            <li>I just bought another at Walmart &amp; it is more of a lotion.  </li>
            <li>lady friend put me onto this, and my skin just looks better...</li>
            <li>Not greasy, very moisturizing, and great smelling.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion but have to order it since I can never find it in stores.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>So I ordered it off Amazon :]</li>
            <li>The smell of this lotion is very mild and quite pleasant so you can use however much you need without it making you smell like you bathed in perfume.</li>
            <li>And my cat greatly disapproves, she wouldn&#x27;t come near me for hours after applying this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is not overly strong in fragrance.</li>
            <li>scent is light so it does not overwhelm</li>
            <li>They sent me a coupon for a free bottle to use at the store (Walmart carries it).  </li>
            <li>I have Type II Diabetes and my doctor who always checks to make sure that my feet are all right</li>
            <li>It works great with my extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have been trying different combinations of body lotion, found all of them doing good for the skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So if you are the type of person that likes being very fragrant then this lotion is for you. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>It smells clean and fresh, almost like I&#x27;ve got that freshly-showered soapy smell.</li>
            <li>I love that St. Ives is completely paraben free</li>
            <li>fragrance is not necessarily unpleasant, just overpowering...</li>
            <li>St Ives makes great quality skin care products and they have never let me down.  </li>
            <li>This is not heavy, it&#x27;s not greasy, it&#x27;s light, rich and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>It is good for people like me with very dry skin to use on winter days but, in the summer, I wouldn&#x27;t need something with the oil in it.</li>
            <li>Someone else can enjoy soft smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so soft after using it and it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling like most others that I have tried.</li>
            <li>The odor, yes odor not scent, of this lotion is far too strong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve come to really appreciate St. Ives lotions!  </li>
            <li>but the content is strong enough that I can get away with just using it once right</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see anyone offering such good moisturizers for this low price.</li>
            <li>I get headaches from most scented things and this one is so mild that it hasn&#x27;t given me even a slight head hurt.</li>
            <li>I have been using this lotion for almost a whole week</li>
            <li>The smell is light enough so I can wear my designer perfume</li>
            <li>Very softening...not sticky or greasy.  </li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>The original product left my skin very nourished and smooth with just a couple of applications daily.  </li>
            <li>More amazingly, people put this on, combine it with some equally reeking deodorant, spray your hair with yet another equally unpleasant hair spray, then put on clothes which emit yet another stench from the laundry detergent you use, and then spray yourself with an expensive nice sent, expecting to have an attractive presentation for others to experience?  </li>
            <li>This product worked for me better than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone with overly oily skin that has been let down by so many other lotions, and those who are prone to headaches caused by strong smells!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lotion and recommend just buying it on-line so that you don&#x27;t have to run around looking for it</li>
            <li>It has worked really well throughout the winter when my skin was super dry.</li>
            <li>For some reason, stores that sell St. Ives lotions don&#x27;t normally sell this one.</li>
            <li>I love it so much to the point that I hunted for it in 4 different stores where I live, didn&#x27;t find it, and refused to buy any other lotion.</li>
            <li>My husband is very sensitive to perfumes, and he LOVES the smell of this lotion.</li>
            <li>:) seriously i have about 8 or 9 large bottles in my closet because i&#x27;m worried they&#x27;ll stop making it.</li>
            <li>im using now but dont&#x27; see the result completely yet, hope is working.</li>
            <li>This product works very well, especially when paired with the matching body wash.</li>
            <li>but this one last the whole day.  </li>
            <li>I finally found a lotion that really works.</li>
            <li>I had never found a lotion that truly worked for my body much less my super sensitive and oily skin on my face, until I found this!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather go without any lotion for a few days than use any other kind.</li>
            <li>It is the only lotion I have been able to use on my whole body without ill effects.</li>
            <li>Highly recomend this to anyone who has dry itchy skin.</li>
            <li>It works way better than the expensive Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture Sensitive Skin lotion I have been using!</li>
            <li>I use this new product numerous times daily and it does not have the same effect at all.  </li>
            <li>If you are one who purchases expensive scents, this is a great product to completely destroy your investment.  </li>

            <li> Older people usually have groddy feet</li>
            <li> Many people recommend Eucerin, but I just can&#x27;t stand the grease slick it leaves behind.</li>
            <li> long!</li>
            <li> Trust me, just put yourself on Subscribe and Save because everyone in the house will be parchment dry this winter.</li>
            <li> I tend to have dry skin and it helps a lot.</li>
            <li> I have problems with dry skin.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is in the top 10 unpleasant scents I have ever encountered.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t loose.</li>
            <li> but it is almost impossible to find in most stores (walmart, target, etc).  </li>
            <li> The scent is different - not sweet or flowery -</li>
            <li> I can use a whole pump on each leg and the smell, while faint, fades away after a short time.</li>
            <li> This winter has been hard on my skin to the point is actually hurt because it was so dry.</li>
            <li> I also like the other scents</li>
            <li> This, rather than any other lotion (and I have used tonnes) works.</li>
            <li> Usually, I have to put cream on my arms and legs several times a day</li>
            <li> So as not to waste it I use it to moisturize my feet.</li>
            <li> (I can&#x27;t stand greasy or heavy on the skin)</li>
            <li> oily, sticky, heavy and</li>
            <li> For extra nighttime softness for hands and feet apply lotion then cotton socks and thin cotton gloves.</li>
            <li> What amazes me is that these companies will create these horrid smells and destroy their products with them.  </li>
            <li> A few times I&#x27;ve even had people ask what perfume I was wearing, and all I had on was this lotion.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with St Ives for not testing this one more thoroughly.</li>
            <li> This stuff used to be made without scent., but no more.  </li>
            <li> When I looked inside it was like thick paste.  </li>
            <li> The hair on my legs was growing into the follicle because it couldn&#x27;t break through my dry skin, and we all know how painful that can be.</li>
            <li> but I think you can also buy thin cotton gloves specifically for covering a hand with lotion on it.</li>
            <li> like it is suffocating my skin.</li>
            <li> I have a collection of useless lotions I will throw away now</li>
            <li> My girlfriend purchases some mindblowingly expensive perfumes and if she puts this stuff on, all I can smell is this garbage product.  </li>
            <li> What makes this worse is that this stench is impossible to get off your hands.  </li>
            <li> Just unhappy I can no longer purchase it on the Save and Subscribe</li>
            <li> This lotion does the trick without making me feel greasy or dirty.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the coupon expired 3 weeks after receiving it, and it never got used!  </li>
            <li> - I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
            <li> , i hate lotions, im not a lotion kinda guy...</li>
            <li> I have always had that dreadful oily-dry skin that feels greasy</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The odor, yes odor not scent, of this lotion is far too strong. So as not to waste it I use it to moisturize my feet. I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I love the way this lotion made my skin feel, but didn&#x27;t see &amp;#34;soy&amp;#34; in the ingredients.  Had to give it away.  Someone else can enjoy soft smooth skin.  Really nice scent.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this line of St Ives lotion but it is almost impossible to find in most stores (walmart, target, etc).  So this is nice to find on easy amazon!</li>
            <li> Long lasting moisurization that doesn&#x27;t just soak in and go away!  I found out I had an allergy to parabens which are in everything from make up to sunscreen and lotions.  I love that St. Ives is completely paraben free and I can use it without worry!</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer</li>
            <li> Get it! This is a no brainer. Trust me, just put yourself on Subscribe and Save because everyone in the house will be parchment dry this winter. This is not heavy, it&#x27;s not greasy, it&#x27;s light, rich and smells fantastic. (I can&#x27;t stand greasy or heavy on the skin) Keeps the parchment legs and hands to a minimum. I appreciate products that perform above my expectations.</li>
            <li> This is very pleasant and smooth to use - I like it.  I tend to have dry skin and it helps a lot.</li>
            <li> Came on time, no damages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t beat the price. Plan to getting some more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;saves me a trip to CVS.</li>
            <li> I love St Ives lotions - the odor is not overpowering &amp; It works great with my extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have always had that dreadful oily-dry skin that feels greasy yet looks parched, especially on my face. This winter has been hard on my skin to the point is actually hurt because it was so dry. The hair on my legs was growing into the follicle because it couldn&#x27;t break through my dry skin, and we all know how painful that can be. I got this lotion thinking it would be just like every lotion is on my skin: oily, sticky, heavy and like it is suffocating my skin. I have been using this lotion for almost a whole week and I will never not have this lotion! It is the only lotion I have been able to use on my whole body without ill effects. My skin drinks it up and it makes my skin look and feel so healthy. But get this!! I can use it on my face, and it does not make my skin oily at all!!!! It works way better than the expensive Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture Sensitive Skin lotion I have been using! Since I was 11(I&#x27;m 20 now) I had never found a lotion that truly worked for my body much less my super sensitive and oily skin on my face, until I found this! I have a collection of useless lotions I will throw away now that I have this one! The smell of this lotion is very mild and quite pleasant so you can use however much you need without it making you smell like you bathed in perfume. I can use a whole pump on each leg and the smell, while faint, fades away after a short time. I get headaches from most scented things and this one is so mild that it hasn&#x27;t given me even a slight head hurt. I highly recommend this to anyone with overly oily skin that has been let down by so many other lotions, and those who are prone to headaches caused by strong smells!</li>
            <li> St Ives Mineral Therapy lotion is the most intensive moisturizing body lotion I have ever used. Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come to really appreciate St. Ives lotions!  This one is no exception.  The smell is light enough so I can wear my designer perfume but the content is strong enough that I can get away with just using it once right after I shower and not worry about unsightly dry skin or discomfort later. I highly recommend this lotion and recommend just buying it on-line so that you don&#x27;t have to run around looking for it and you have it on hand.  I also like the other scents so I recommend mixing it up a bit.  You can&#x27;t loose. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it still has mineral oil in it, which coats skin.  It is good for people like me with very dry skin to use on winter days but, in the summer, I wouldn&#x27;t need something with the oil in it.</li>
            <li> This, rather than any other lotion (and I have used tonnes) works. I have Type II Diabetes and my doctor who always checks to make sure that my feet are all right has complimented me on the condition of my feet. Older people usually have groddy feet so I expect mine are a relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is light so it does not overwhelm so you can also use this at night if you want to. For extra nighttime softness for hands and feet apply lotion then cotton socks and thin cotton gloves. Do an Amazon search but I think you can also buy thin cotton gloves specifically for covering a hand with lotion on it.</li>
            <li> BEST. LOTION. EVER. not too greasy, not too watery, nicely scented but not overpowering at all. PERFECT. the only problem is that i can never find it in stores! so i stock up online :) seriously i have about 8 or 9 large bottles in my closet because i&#x27;m worried they&#x27;ll stop making it.</li>
            <li> im using now but dont&#x27; see the result completely yet, hope is working. the smell is nice , I will get more if is work</li>
            <li> The best lotion ever.  Just unhappy I can no longer purchase it on the Save and Subscribe</li>
            <li> Great for the price. Nothing stunning.</li>
            <li> St Ives makes great quality skin care products and they have never let me down.  I use this every morning after applying coconut oil all over my skin - it works!</li>
            <li> When I received the lotion, it wouldn&#x27;t come through the pump.  When I looked inside it was like thick paste.  I called St. Ives &amp; was told that should not be like that &amp; most likely was stored wrong.  They sent me a coupon for a free bottle to use at the store (Walmart carries it).  Unfortunately, the coupon expired 3 weeks after receiving it, and it never got used!  I just bought another at Walmart &amp; it is more of a lotion.  I would have given this 5 stars because the lotion is fantastic!!  Very softening...not sticky or greasy.  The only reason for the 4 stars is because the product was defective, but I still used it by glopping it on with the straw end of the pump.</li>
            <li> Trust me, im a guy, i hate lotions, im not a lotion kinda guy...lady friend put me onto this, and my skin just looks better...great mild smell that goes away before you can get clothes on...good stuff</li>
            <li> This product works very well, especially when paired with the matching body wash. It is not overly strong in fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! It has worked really well throughout the winter when my skin was super dry. I use it every day!</li>
            <li> I have problems with dry skin.  This product worked for me better than any other I&#x27;ve tried. Usually, I have to put cream on my arms and legs several times a day but this one last the whole day.  The scent is different - not sweet or flowery - but I like it. Give it a try - I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have been trying different combinations of body lotion, found all of them doing good for the skin. I don&#x27;t see anyone offering such good moisturizers for this low price. Mineral therapy and almond lotions have a good fragrance that won&#x27;t disturb the serenity of mind. Try it!! Better than those expensive and heftily priced brands.</li>
            <li> I would give this 5 stars if not for the overpowering fragrance. Moisturizing quality is superb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is not necessarily unpleasant, just overpowering... it never goes away... all... day.... long! Started giving me a headache by the afternoon. And my cat greatly disapproves, she wouldn&#x27;t come near me for hours after applying this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you are the type of person that likes being very fragrant then this lotion is for you. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Loved this product, up until the time my wife hijacked it from me.</li>
            <li> good moisturizing but I&#x27;m not fond of the scent</li>
            <li> This is not a product I would purchase again or recommend to anyone.  The original product left my skin very nourished and smooth with just a couple of applications daily.  I use this new product numerous times daily and it does not have the same effect at all.  I am very disappointed with St Ives for not testing this one more thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Stinking, Reeking goo.  This stuff is in the top 10 unpleasant scents I have ever encountered.  What makes this worse is that this stench is impossible to get off your hands.  If you are one who purchases expensive scents, this is a great product to completely destroy your investment.  My girlfriend purchases some mindblowingly expensive perfumes and if she puts this stuff on, all I can smell is this garbage product.  This stuff used to be made without scent., but no more.  What amazes me is that these companies will create these horrid smells and destroy their products with them.  More amazingly, people put this on, combine it with some equally reeking deodorant, spray your hair with yet another equally unpleasant hair spray, then put on clothes which emit yet another stench from the laundry detergent you use, and then spray yourself with an expensive nice sent, expecting to have an attractive presentation for others to experience?  Really?</li>
            <li> This lotion works good, and is not greasy. My husband is very sensitive to perfumes, and he LOVES the smell of this lotion. For some reason, stores that sell St. Ives lotions don&#x27;t normally sell this one.</li>
            <li> This lotion is the best drug store lotion out there. Not greasy, very moisturizing, and great smelling. Many people recommend Eucerin, but I just can&#x27;t stand the grease slick it leaves behind. This lotion does the trick without making me feel greasy or dirty. I use it on my legs after I shave, and it keeps razor burn away. A few times I&#x27;ve even had people ask what perfume I was wearing, and all I had on was this lotion. It smells clean and fresh, almost like I&#x27;ve got that freshly-showered soapy smell. Love it!!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion but have to order it since I can never find it in stores. It&#x27;s the best St. Ives lotion formula.</li>
            <li> This lotion is the only lotion I have ever used that makes my skin noticeably softer, and even. I LOVE it. I love it so much to the point that I hunted for it in 4 different stores where I live, didn&#x27;t find it, and refused to buy any other lotion. So I ordered it off Amazon :] I&#x27;d rather go without any lotion for a few days than use any other kind. I definitely recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I finally found a lotion that really works. My skin is so soft after using it and it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling like most others that I have tried. Highly recomend this to anyone who has dry itchy skin.</li>
