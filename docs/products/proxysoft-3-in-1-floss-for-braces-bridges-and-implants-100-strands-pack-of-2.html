            <li>Leaves my teeth and gums feeling clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay product but not as good as some other flossers.  </li>

            <li>Better price and great quantity than the Ortho-B product that is hard to find in stores.</li>

            <li>okay if you have large enough gaps in your appliances; too flimsy if not.</li>
            <li>The only difference, really, is that the threader on the Thornton is a bit more flimsy, so I nicked it a star.</li>
            <li>Got it fast.</li>
            <li>fast delivery and 200 as advertised.</li>
            <li>I tried for the first time I use this type of floos for my new brigde, and work very well.</li>
            <li>Live the blue end that makes it so easy to thread through dental work.</li>
            <li>The stiff threader isn&#x27;t very strong.</li>
            <li>under a fixed bridge that is part of the floss.&lt;br /&gt;You can get cheaper floss</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a dentist with a fixed bridge.</li>
            <li>The threader end is not stiff enough.</li>

            <li> Used it for long time and make the work</li>
            <li> works well once it is under the bridge, but the tip is not very stiff and it is hard to thread it through initially.</li>
            <li> I bought this instead of the super floss, which is way too expensive.</li>

            <li> Does the job, difficult to remove from package.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s almost impossible to get into position under the bridge.  </li>
            <li> Packaged bad.  </li>

            <li> Best floss I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Not as good as some that I previously used but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Best dental floss particularly for those of us with extensive work--dental implants, periodontal surgery.</li>
            <li> Better value than super floss and it&#x27;s the same thing</li>
            <li> My daughter has braces and this floss is a life saver. She&#x27;s able to thoroughly clean her teeth much quicker and easier than regular floss alone.</li>
            <li> When you have braces at retirement age, these help a lot.</li>
            <li> Great product, Best pricing and Rapid shipment</li>
            <li> In the past I have used the Oral B brand but Thortons is much better in my opinion. I will continue to use Thorntons floss.</li>
            <li> My son hates these!  Had to trash them and get him different ones. He is 11 and used him with his braces.</li>
            <li> Product was way overpriced! Had no alternative, so I took it. With shipping and pricing, it cost me $20.00 to floss for one month. I found better pricing on Drugstore.com.</li>
            <li> Used it for long time and make the work</li>
            <li> My Husband uses this floss and prefers it to others.</li>
            <li> Not as good as oral b super floss</li>
            <li> works well once it is under the bridge, but the tip is not very stiff and it is hard to thread it through initially.</li>
            <li> Got it fast. Live the blue end that makes it so easy to thread through dental work.</li>
            <li> These were exactly what I was looking for. I prefer these over using a loop threader and floss.</li>
            <li> I bought this instead of the super floss, which is way too expensive. The only difference, really, is that the threader on the Thornton is a bit more flimsy, so I nicked it a star. Other than that, works great.</li>
            <li> Threads okay if you have large enough gaps in your appliances; too flimsy if not.</li>
            <li> Packaged bad.  Hard to get 1 strand out without being a mess after.</li>
            <li> I had bought this product before and it was of high quality, but this order was of poor quality, I would not recomend this product, the sponge part of the floss is soooo thin, which is different from the last time I ordered.</li>
            <li> This glosser does not work well for my bridge.  The threader end is not stiff enough.</li>
            <li> These are exactly as what my dentist told me to use for my dental implants.</li>
            <li> I looked for the Super floss and could not find it, gave up and then I found this (made by the same manufacture).&lt;br /&gt;When you get through flossing your teeth feel clean and the floss is easy to hold on to and last it has a threater to&lt;br /&gt;get under a fixed bridge that is part of the floss.&lt;br /&gt;You can get cheaper floss but then thats what you got, cheap floss!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay product but not as good as some other flossers.  The threader end isn&#x27;t as rigid as it could be and it&#x27;s almost impossible to get into position under the bridge.  Two people in our family tried them and came to the same conclusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry Thornton people, you should know better than what you produce!</li>
            <li> Not waxed. Difficult to guide through teeth. Wasted purchase.</li>
            <li> Better price and great quantity than the Ortho-B product that is hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> The stiff threader isn&#x27;t very strong. I often have to use 2 just to do the 8 teeth that have a permanent retainer. Super floss holds up better.</li>
            <li> Does the job, difficult to remove from package.</li>
            <li> Great price and quick delivery!</li>
            <li> Hardly better than regular dental floss. The tips aren&#x27;t firm enough to get between my bridges, so they are useless to weave around my teeth. At $20 it&#x27;s a rip off.</li>
            <li> For people who have to live with braces this is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I tried for the first time I use this type of floos for my new brigde, and work very well. I like the fact that you can take one just one stand at a time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dentist with a fixed bridge. Been using this floss for ten years works better than all others because it gets inder bridges and has&lt;br /&gt;a fluffy section to help remove plaque.</li>
            <li> This works just as well as more expensive products.</li>
            <li> I had  difficulty using this product.  The floss often splits and gets stuck in my teeth.</li>
            <li> great product excellent service :)</li>
            <li> fast delivery and 200 as advertised.</li>
            <li> love the cleaning it does, gets more than regular floss</li>
            <li> Not as good as superfloss but would order again if I had to. The thick part snags on braces and leaves residual threads often, but not always.</li>
            <li> Was noting like I expected. Too flimsy. It&#x27;s not sturdy enough to be used as a threader for bridgework and braces. It was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> These Thornton 3-in-one Floss Strands are great.  Leaves my teeth and gums feeling clean.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years....works well for crown and bridgework.</li>
            <li> the pieces get tangled in the box, and when using them the nylon is not resistant enough</li>
