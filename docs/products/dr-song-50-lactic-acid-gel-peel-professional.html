            <li>Very good product.  </li>
            <li>The dropper that comes with it doesn&#x27;t do a very good job of getting the gel out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>This is a very good product.</li>

            <li>I feel like I am erasing years of skin damage leaving my with beautiful glowing skin.</li>
            <li>We know what the bottle looks like lol I have not achieved &amp;#34;clear skin&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>, I felt I looked great.  </li>
            <li>However, the results were great.</li>
            <li>Lactic is great for my skin type, which is combination, yet hormonal and acne prone at my jawline.</li>

            <li>Great peel.  </li>
            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li>i bought this because i read some great reviews about it.</li>
            <li>Dr song was great.</li>
            <li>I know it is going to take time, but I am happy to see even the slightest results.</li>
            <li>I think this is a great product if you want smoother and brighter skin.</li>
            <li>This face peel is supposed to be great for wrinkles, hyperpigmentation, scars...</li>
            <li>Either way this peel stimulates collagen production so it is a great step before moving on to stronger peels like TCA or phenol.</li>
            <li>Happy I tried it and should have done it sooner.</li>
            <li>Great Buy</li>
            <li>Arrived on time great packaging.</li>
            <li>Which in turns means more age spots!!</li>
            <li>Very nice quality and thickness to it.</li>
            <li>and the end result is amazing!</li>
            <li>Amazing!  </li>
            <li>I have used most all of the products that Dr Song sells- very good products and affordable too!</li>
            <li>I love to use products because I want that perfect skin</li>
            <li>&amp; I could do it on my own time!</li>
            <li>You are guaranteed bright, clearer, tighter skin after just one application.</li>
            <li>This dries out your skin so use a good face cream.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed with how smooth my skin was after I used this chemical peel.</li>
            <li>Then you should be good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(which is good-</li>
            <li>Theres no peeling,  which is good.</li>
            <li>Lactic acid peels are good for hyperpigmentation and age/sun spots.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to have something effective for home.</li>
            <li>good things-</li>
            <li>it fells good too..</li>
            <li>Good, does the job and is affordable.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m good with this &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; acid.</li>
            <li>Happy shopping :)</li>
            <li>Very pleased with immediate results.</li>
            <li>GREAT PEEL FOR PEOPLE WHO LOVE</li>
            <li>Great Product ... love it</li>
            <li>Let it be known that this stuff POTENT!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m already satisfied with my purchase!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Stings like the dickens, that&#x27;s for sure!  </li>
            <li>Use a moisturizer with a 30 SPF sunscreen for sure!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I tried it anyway!  </li>
            <li>It feels more radiant!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>As another reviewer stated if applied on a pimple it will greatly reduce the size very quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had amazing results with just a couple uses.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>My skin is bright and healthy.</li>
            <li>product is amazing and will make your skin feel amazing.</li>
            <li>This is a great light peel.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s effective</li>
            <li>There is a warning on the bottle to Use at your own risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As it said &#x27;Use at your own risk&#x27;, but it might be just the thing to help your skin look and feel better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>As it said &#x27;Use at your own risk&#x27;, but it might be just the thing to help your skin look and feel better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t have wanted to go out to a nice dinner or anything with it looking like that.  </li>
            <li>All that junk they sell in salons and stores, smells nice but doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>I did it myself and in my own bathroom!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I peeled nicely.</li>
            <li>Today, chemical peels have evolved to include take-home peels and kits, allowing you to reap their benefits in the privacy of your own home.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*I was sent this item for review, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>They sent me glycoluc acid by mistake, so I don&#x27;t really know how to rate this, but I thought the glycoluc acid was wonderful.</li>
            <li>and I would never post an opinion that wasn&#x27;t my own.</li>
            <li>Honestly I have never herd of anything called a peel.</li>
            <li>However, it is doing what it should and people are noticing that my skin looks nice.</li>
            <li>There is great customer service and this product is very reasonably priced and a good product/peel.</li>
            <li>This is a very strong peel that works amazingly, it needs to come with directions though.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent value, and high quality.</li>
            <li>I did receive this product for free to try out, but these are my own unbiased opinions!</li>
            <li>I will be a loyal and happy customer from now on.</li>
            <li>Again, this is very strong, so you should do a skin patch test</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very strong</li>
            <li>I am an Esthetician and this is very strong.</li>
            <li>, so you bet I was thrilled when I was able to review Dr. Song&#x27;s Lactic Acid peel in 50%.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best product for the price.</li>
            <li>I have a fair (light) complexion and have been using a 2% solution of retinol</li>
            <li>( I had read somewhere in one review that it helps calm the stinging sensation ) and it felt great.</li>
            <li>clear instructions, great product!</li>
            <li>Great customer service and the price is right.</li>
            <li>This stuff is strong!</li>
            <li>it’s strong!</li>
            <li>This is some strong stuff!</li>
            <li>I also think a good sunscreen that we should be using anyways.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great idea that if you have a special event don&#x27;t use this product right before.  </li>
            <li>It leaves a very smooth to the touch face.</li>
            <li>The good thing is it takes 1 minute and produces huge, noticeable results, so it&#x27;s very quick gratification.</li>
            <li>In addition, because lactic acid peels can cause skin to become very sensitive to sun light, winter is the perfect time to try them out.</li>
            <li>Also include a tutorial video on the website :)</li>
            <li>Listen to instructions and don&#x27;t keep it on for more than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>but you have to know how to stop the burn :-)</li>
            <li>My kids and husband noticed without me even saying a thing :)</li>
            <li>I love peels</li>
            <li>are many benefits in a peel of this form because it provides a deeper exfoliation.  </li>
            <li>Within four days the skin healed and the top layer peeled off.</li>
            <li>Works fantastic!</li>
            <li>I knew Dr Song was a reputable brand in the teeth whitening department, and I&#x27;m so glad they have expanded into skin</li>
            <li>After which, I noticed that my skin is luminous, more even skin tone, and pigmentation started to fade</li>
            <li>I am so in love with Dr. Song products, including the Vitamin C/Hyralounic Acid serum.  </li>
            <li>Now if only they would create a product with Retinol/Retinoids, they would have a perfect trifecta of skin products.  </li>
            <li>Enjoying using.</li>
            <li>I love all Dr. Song products.  </li>
            <li>Works better than glycolic acid.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s permanent, but it&#x27;s not there any more.  </li>
            <li>I do feel they should give you better, more thorough instructions on the products.</li>
            <li>Skin look measurably better after one week.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>not apply the peel more than once in a 7 day period&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;LOVE, LOVE,</li>
            <li>I love the way my skin feels after I use my peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You’ll find that your beauty creams and serums will work better when you add Dr Song to your beauty routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>TO LOVE</li>
            <li>You’ll find that your beauty creams and serums will work better when you add Dr Song to your beauty routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>TO LOVE</li>
            <li>My skin is more even and supple.</li>
            <li>Keep up the fantastic work!</li>
            <li>So I bought two bottles many months ago and put them away and just never got around to using them.</li>
            <li>it shipped fast - which is really great.</li>
            <li>Make sure to wash your face before and after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li>sure to test this out on your hand before applying to your face.</li>
            <li>I love the Dr. Song product line.</li>
            <li>Make sure to do the skin test.</li>
            <li>I used the Googles to get better instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I planned to keep using them more often</li>
            <li>I found mixed reviews that both impressed and terrified me.    </li>
            <li>70% Glycolic  is a better option and use by dermatologist.</li>
            <li>I have really enjoyed testing this product and seeing what it has done for my skin.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say how it works with that, but it made my skin glowy and smooth!</li>
            <li>Hopefully I will be able to work up to a couple of minutes at a time.</li>
            <li>I do recommend you make sure you do it on a day you aren&#x27;t going out at all or at night before bed</li>
            <li>(that will make it peel more).</li>
            <li>My skin is much more healthy looking</li>
            <li>I just love how my skin looks after using this peel.</li>
            <li>I look forward to using this product - something that I can&#x27;t say for most skin products.</li>
            <li>If you do apply it all over, make sure to not get close to your eyes.</li>
            <li>This is so much more inexpensive than going to the dermatologist and paying lots of money</li>

            <li>I may just experiment with the areas that have the most freckles.</li>
            <li>I will however, use the product much more often than once a month.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m confident that it will continue to soften my skin and slough freckles and fade malasma.  </li>
            <li>I used it mostly on my chin where scarring is from plucking hairs.</li>
            <li>Will just do it more often to get the results I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product, and I expect to see more results.</li>
            <li>Using this acid for 3rd time, it is great!!</li>
            <li>And I love the price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>The skin around my nose (like many) is getting too  sensitive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My confident level was none.</li>
            <li>I am so confident I no longer have to put concealer under my chin.</li>
            <li>The rest of my skin looks much better too.</li>
            <li>that I&#x27;m sure more uses will rectify</li>
            <li>I washed it off and felt better.</li>
            <li>This product arrived right on time and in good condition.</li>
            <li>DO a Skin Patch Test FIRST!!!  </li>
            <li>I was very excited when I received this peel for review.</li>
            <li>I was very excited, but nervous to try this peel as I have never used a peel before.</li>
            <li>It took about a full week for these to go away, and now that my skin has had time to rest the results are FANTASTIC!!  </li>
            <li>I first did a &amp;#34;spot test&amp;#34;  and after 45 seconds, I felt that was my good start point.  </li>
            <li>I just started doing peels recently and they are amazing!!</li>
            <li>It has been a week now and my skin looks better and feels smooth.</li>
            <li>Great product for when you lack the time (&amp; the money) to go have a professional peel.  </li>
            <li>I became more comfortable using it.</li>
            <li>Its just so much younger looking, brighter, more beautiful skin.</li>
            <li>A good friend recommended it, but it didn&#x27;t do much for me.  </li>
            <li>I have to say Dr. OZ was right!!</li>
            <li>Great product arrived quickly and seems to be the real deal.</li>
            <li>Pretty good for the price, I tried a more expensive brand; #1 Best Seller on Amazon for $34.00 and this worked just as good.</li>
            <li>I didn’t even make it a full minute before I had to rinse my face!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIRST and foremost!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say that after only one use of this peel I noticed a huge difference!</li>
            <li>Easy to use,</li>
            <li>It was easy to do</li>
            <li>I never understand why celebrities that are older but still look really good have age spots on their hands.</li>
            <li>too strong for me...</li>
            <li>and I used it twice not as strong</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have fine lines or wrinkles or sun spots</li>
            <li>All seemed fine, so I proceeded to use the product as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have some acne scarring on my cheeks as well as a fine line on my forehead</li>
            <li>I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li>I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t fear, I used good old Google and found them!</li>
            <li>Its not a dramatic change, but it does strech your sking nicely and pumps it up a bit afterwards.  </li>
            <li>It is very strong so be cautious using it on the first try.</li>
            <li>and I already see a huge difference in my skin..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>Inside is a card noting that the detailed instructions on usage have been sent to the email associated with the Amazon account.</li>
            <li>Their products are really intense and effective.</li>
            <li>Great for resurfacing of the skin, cleaning out debris from pores and especially beneficial for mature/aging skin.  </li>
            <li>Great for fading finer lines and improving overall the look of your skin.  </li>
            <li>I washed it off and noticed how smooth my skin felt.</li>
            <li>It is gentle and effective for at home use.</li>
            <li>It is gentle and effective for at home use.</li>
            <li>monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation).</li>
            <li>This is a great product to use at home instead of spending a lot of money on salons for the same peeling product.</li>
            <li>It has a light scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently leaving it on for 4minutes and feels great.</li>
            <li>I get some light tingling while using but nothing, not even redness, after washing off.</li>
            <li>I dumped some baking soda in the bathroom sink and filled it with water.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product wise - It&#x27;s too early for me to say anything as I have used peels before</li>
            <li>And so far, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>it was easy and quick to do the peel, and 3.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super strong and produces a burning sensation when you&#x27;re using it.</li>
            <li>Received item quickly and instructions were easy to follow.</li>
            <li>Works well and is more gentle as a gel rather than lactic acid!  </li>
            <li>Been using for like 3 weeks, 2 times a week and can see a significant difference.</li>
            <li>I love that this product now comes in dropper form, which makes measuring and dispensing the product much easier!  </li>
            <li>I have only used it twice and can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve seen remarkable results yet.</li>
            <li>so I meticulously followed the instructions sent by mail, applied this gel twice a week and 3-4 days after every peel I&#x27;ve been excited to notice that my underarms were atleast 2 shades lighter.</li>
            <li>I love being able to use a professional product at home.  </li>
            <li>Very good for blemishes and uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Things I highly recommend are to really really stay out of the sun after a peel, slather good moisturizer on your face (don&#x27;t skimp), and try not to wash your face for a day or two (after neutralizing the acid).  </li>
            <li>I reccomend a gentle exfoliant because you want it to heal the bottom layer of skin before scrubbing off the top layer .  </li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.carefully applied to my face.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>skin irritation occurs remove the product by neutralizing with cool water immediately and consult a physician.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I want to really get the top layer of sun damaged skin off of my hands and keep this up</li>
            <li>only downside was that it didn&#x27;t come with good instructions.  </li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>Would recommend this to anyone who wants better looking skin</li>
            <li>I lasted about a minute and rinsed off in cool water and then moisturized and went to sleep.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>Dr. Song&#x27;s Lactic Acid Gel Peel works just like any professional peel and you can do it in the comfort of your own</li>
            <li>If it begins to irritate your skin or feel like it is burning, it is recommended to rinse your face with cool water to neutralize it.  </li>
            <li>I really liked this and would recommend it to people who don&#x27;t have overly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>And the following day a friend commented and asked if I had done something to my face because it looked good..</li>
            <li>And I can really say my skin locks so much better.</li>
            <li>Dr Song 50% Lactic Acid Peel is a professional grade peel that you can do in the comfort of your own home.</li>
            <li>Not bad..</li>
            <li>, also most importantly, I use Khiel&#x27;s 50 SPF facial sunscreen on the top of my hands always, luckily I don&#x27;t have any spots</li>
            <li>and boy did my face feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>will definitely do another application but will wait a couple more weeks and not leave on more than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>I know some people get scared off by the main ingredient, named &amp;#34;Lactic Acid&amp;#34; and then on top of that it follows with &amp;#34;Face Peel&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>This particular peel is Fantastic!</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly and as described.</li>
            <li>so when the 3 minutes were up, I quickly rinsed it off with water.</li>
            <li>This product was provided to me for testing and review purposes, but I would never endorse something that I didn&#x27;t believe was worthy of it</li>
            <li>I had never tried a lactic acid face peel prior to being chosen for the Dr Song 50% Lactic Acid Face Peel promotion, I was given the product for free in return for an honest product</li>
            <li>I Purchased this peel this week, delivery was quick.</li>
            <li>but it went away quickly</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>However, I found it mild in conjunction with retin A, but then again i&#x27;m treating my neck area.</li>
            <li>It gets rid of any imperfections, but it&#x27;s very strong and not for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lactic acid is an alpha hydroxy acid that is mild and suitable even for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>And it is important that you follow the instructions exactly.</li>
            <li>And it is important that you follow the instructions exactly.</li>
            <li>The very first time I just tried it in one area for about 1 minute.  </li>
            <li>It is great for hyper-pigmentations and dark spots.</li>
            <li>Then, 2-3 days after I received the product got a strange email that was more about ordering more than instructions on how to use.  </li>
            <li>Austin helped with all my questions about the peels and took great care of me as there new and future customer.&lt;br</li>

            <li>If you&#x27;re anything like me and don&#x27;t want to spend big bucks or rather just do it in the comfort of your own home, I would recommend trying this peel.</li>
            <li>It’s like starting with a clean canvas!!</li>
            <li>It’s like starting with a clean canvas!!</li>
            <li>It also makes your skin brighter right after using it, kinda like it&#x27;s been illuminated from within.</li>
            <li>I am still hoping that I am using it right.  </li>
            <li>I used  the vitamin C serum  right after.</li>
            <li>I have tried other lactic acid peels and I think this product is far superior!  </li>
            <li>So far, I am pretty pleased.</li>
            <li>is great for wrinkles, hyperpigmentation, scars, and so many other things because it reveals new skin completely.</li>
            <li>they DO all work differently and they are very strong and can do damage without knowing what to do specifically.</li>
            <li>skin is getting super soft and smooth</li>
            <li>This is very affordable, considering how strong it is and how much you get.</li>
            <li>The acid is derived from milk and considered to be mild when it comes to irritations and used in &amp;#34;peel/mask&amp;#34; form by many, and especially first-time users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was gentle, easy to apply, only used a small amount, and, best of all, it worked well.</li>
            <li>It was gentle, easy to apply, only used a small amount, and, best of all, it worked well.</li>
            <li>Certain areas of the face you have to be more careful like around your mouth because it&#x27;ll get more red, but I love it.</li>
            <li>Also, quick shipping and emailed instructions helped the process go much smoother.</li>
            <li>I am not new to this kind of thing.</li>
            <li>a very large notch and first try the 40% glycolic acid.</li>
            <li>one is pretty strong so if you have sensitive skin, I would start with something weaker.  </li>
            <li>Lactic acid is derived from Milk and is very gentle.</li>
            <li>I did follow up with a very gentle  moisturizer after.</li>
            <li>bottle is a pretty little glass bottle that contains a good amount of the peel.</li>
            <li>New cells means the signs of aging, wrinkles, crow’s feet, fine lines and dark patches, disappear, and give your skin a youthful AMAZING glow!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First, this is not a &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>My first time with this type of peel and it burned quite a bit.</li>
            <li>first peel let me know I can increase the time to one minute</li>
            <li>and I did just that and started seeing results with my second peel, which were more noticeable.  </li>
            <li>when I first applied).&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally, I really like this Lactic Peel, because it is gentle enough to use at home, yet still effective at helping increase cell turnover to reveal visible improvements in my skin.</li>
            <li>My first peel</li>
            <li>I got this when it first came out as an introductory price on Amazon, I believe it was 6.99 a bottle.</li>
            <li>I decided to start using the serum because I&#x27;m starting to pay more attention to my hands</li>
            <li>this review is to let everyone know that I left it on the top of both my hands for five minutes, I did not burn at all, then I washed it off.</li>
            <li>I was able to order 3 bottles of Dr. Song vs 1 bottle of the former product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product was my first foray into self-peeling.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently discovered Dr. Song products and I&#x27;ve fallen in love with them.</li>
            <li>Read the directions first...</li>
            <li>I have seen people spend thousands of dollars on chemical peels, and they really don&#x27;t have to do that!</li>
            <li>Definitely stung a bit more.</li>
            <li>The warm, tingling sensation lasted a lot longer than I had expected in that</li>
            <li>was said in the instructions that your first time it might burn.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipment ..!</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly as instructed in an email to me.</li>
            <li>I unwrapped the bottle and the first thing I noticed was that it didn&#x27;t come with directions.</li>
            <li>So I went ahead and applied my first peel.</li>
            <li>I applied it for a minute as suggested for the first time use.</li>
            <li>and I notice that my face is looking more even toned and younger.</li>
            <li>Three weeks later I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>of course I had to diluted it first time around..</li>
            <li>Years later my husband who always supportive told me that he saw on dr oz that lactic peels helps eliminate scars and lighten skin.</li>
            <li>I did break out a bit after my first treatment</li>
            <li>Haha!</li>
            <li>However in about 20 minutes (that is 20 minutes after I washed it off during my first use) my face</li>
            <li>Once the first time finished up, I tried again.</li>
            <li>Available in several percentages from a mild 20% to higher ones like 50% to 70%.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this 3 times and I&#x27;m already noticing a difference as my skin is super smooth.  </li>
            <li>I refuse to pay to get a peel professionally because its highway robbery, but at the same time I haven&#x27;t found many products that are budget friendly that I TRUST.</li>
            <li>Make sure you cut the gel with a little bit of lotion and rinse it off as soon as it \\&quot;tingles.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free to review.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m continuing to use it and hopefully will have some positive results after several more uses.</li>
            <li>Song products could be priced a LOT higher due to their amazing ability to fulfil their promises.</li>
            <li>This is by far the most professional peel I have ever had!</li>
            <li>It almost has a very slight &#x27;brown sugar&#x27; type odor (which I love), and the gel like consistency makes it easy to apply to the face.  </li>
            <li>the peel is amazing follow those directions very very carefully</li>
            <li>Since I’m sensitive about what products I use on my face, the fact that I liked the results I felt after using Dr. Song’s Lactic Acid Facial Peel say a lot.</li>
            <li>and it’s much lighter of a feel than most facial peels.</li>
            <li>Very strong, so  be careful and follow directions.</li>
            <li>The smell is quite strong when you first open it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand all the positive reviews here.</li>
            <li>I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all).</li>
            <li>I was really scared to try this at first because I didn&#x27;t want to be walking around with peeling blotchy skin.  </li>
            <li>It is super easy to use, just take a cotton ball and spread it over the face being careful not to layer over what has already been covered</li>
            <li>At first I was a little scared when I read &amp;#34;use at your own risk&amp;#34; on the label, but then I read through some of the reviews and didn&#x27;t see anything about skin irritation</li>
            <li>it is very important to use sunscreen and stay out of the sun for at least 24 hours since your skin can burn easily after using.  </li>
            <li>Like with any acid peel, as long as you read the directions and follow them carefully, you should be happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>Like with any acid peel, as long as you read the directions and follow them carefully, you should be happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>As long as you follow the directions and use common sense, this is a wonderful peel.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone that doesn&#x27;t have super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I see the price is already a bit more so we&#x27;ll see what my threshold is on how much I&#x27;m willing to spend once this bottle is empty.</li>
            <li>If you expose your skin to the sun you MUST apply sunscreen because your skin will be super sensitive to exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think there should be directions that come with this peel, especially being that it is so strong.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong but not overpowering, it&#x27;s definitely bearable.</li>
            <li>This is purely because I remember Samantha from Sex and the City after her chemical peel disaster.</li>
            <li>and I know that some can be weak sometimes, but Dr. Song&#x27;s peel is definitely one of the best i&#x27;ve ordered on amazon.</li>
            <li>but it really did address a large portion of the newer scars.</li>
            <li>Before I go into the review, below is a little information on the acid and my non-professional steps when I do my own</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t come with any real applicator</li>
            <li>If you can&#x27;t afford a real peel, try it I suppose.</li>
            <li>If you can afford the real thing, skip this.</li>
            <li>I waited 60 seconds and removed gently with soap and water.</li>
            <li>My only recommendation is that Dr. Song Medicals include detailed instructions with each product.</li>

            <li>My only recommendation is that Dr. Song Medicals include detailed instructions with each product.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll want to use an intense moisturizer after this to reveal even softer, smoother skin.</li>
            <li>I was really scared to try this lactic acid face peel.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed, especially since I&#x27;m going light with it</li>
            <li>My only con is that the directions are not included with the product and are e-mailed, also available on their website.  </li>
            <li>received the above product(s) free of charge from Dr. Song.  </li>
            <li>My only con is that the directions are not included with the product and are e-mailed, also available on their website.  </li>
            <li>received the above product(s) free of charge from Dr. Song.  </li>
            <li>I was very scared I permanently damaged my skin and my eyes.</li>
            <li>As soon as I put it on my face it started to burn intensely</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.</li>
            <li>My skin burned much , I could not use the product.</li>
            <li>You should also know how a chemical peel works is similar to a good exfoliation or microdermabrasion, except that it is not a physical sloughing of the top dead layer of skin cells.</li>
            <li>All of my freckles are gone thanks to Dr. Song&#x27;s solution.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment</li>
            <li>I feel there should be detailed instructions with every individual peel-</li>
            <li>I tried to find a website - but couldn&#x27;t find too much??</li>
            <li>I just hope the price does not rise so much it becomes too</li>
            <li>This is absolutely perfect!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product works as a gentle peel.  </li>
            <li>and it just really looks unattractive and shows their age.</li>
            <li>but there was no burning, it was very tolerable.</li>
            <li>The serum has a very sticky feel to it and quite a stronger scent than I am use to.</li>
            <li>The real deal.</li>
            <li>I first tried Dr. Song’s Lactic Acid Facial Peel, using the directions I found on their website, I was not surprised by the warm, tingling sensation I felt.</li>
            <li>the lactic acid came, I was determined to make my whole face peel.  </li>
            <li>This really made my nose and chin blister up.  </li>
            <li>I used an intense moisturizer and it revealed softer and smoother skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have a lot experience with these kinds of products</li>
            <li>My face was really tingling</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d tried a dozen home remedies before, nothing really helped.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>I had my daughter about a year ago and my whole pregnancy</li>
            <li>This time I was ready with the baking soda ahead of time.</li>
            <li>Still burned, and still felt like sand, but I was ready.</li>
            <li>Buffed off flakey skin the next day and ski was soft and better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to use this product twice in the last month, since I am also still doing Professional treatments at the spa where I work.</li>
            <li>Will surely buy again in the near future.</li>
            <li>It is kind of weird because it is a gel it just sits on top of your skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Warning: Use at your own risk (For external use only).</li>
            <li>My skin is already soft but after each use my skin felt like my sons cheeks :) only noticeable change.</li>
            <li>peel has worked to get rid of old acne scars and marks on my face and my skin tone is more even and pores seem smaller.</li>
            <li>- I decided to apply the acid once again on my skin, this time I tried it on the right cheek again, this time only for 6 minutes, and then the right cheek for 8 minutes.  </li>
            <li>This was my first lactic acid peel and I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>The first time I saw a huge improvement in texture, and brightness and the second peel slightly burned my face and was red for a day but looked great the next day.</li>
            <li>Over time your pores become clogged and you need something stronger than a facial cleaner to clean out those pores.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and cant wait to see how much more my dark spots will get lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty excited to see what the second peel offers.</li>
            <li>The packaging was very sturdy and the bottle is made of high quality materials.</li>
            <li>- Applied Solution to a small part of right cheek that had an aging brown-spot 10 mm in length for something like 15 minutes or more.  </li>
            <li>and I honestly can already see a slight reduction so far.</li>
            <li>I love that Dr Song Medical products are made in the USA and is FDA compliant and a provider of professional products that focus on natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>15-20 full facial peels (30 nl/ 1 oz)&lt;br /&gt;Comes with 365 Day&lt;br /&gt;100%</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t apply this more than once every week, but I use it even less than that.</li>
            <li>and I then used a mild facial wash to deactivate the acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I put ice on it the next day also, but by the next day it started looking better.</li>
            <li>Peels can increase your skin’s sensitivity to the sun and particularly the possibility of sunburn.</li>
            <li>I use it on my knees and my heels and sure enough about 1-2 weeks later that area is peeling.  </li>
            <li>By the way I am battling Acne Scars, so this is the main reason I wanted to review this product.</li>
            <li>It has the classic shiny silver Dr. Song label.</li>
            <li>I have freckles since I was born, mainly on both cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Just make sure that you read all of the directions online clearly and follow them carefully.</li>
            <li>There is still some scarring that was older</li>
            <li>Its strong so follow the directions carefully.</li>
            <li>really feel that if you follow the directions that the product is pretty easy to use, I really like the product and am less afraid of using the product more and more.</li>
            <li>It just made sense to me to try their gel peel because they make high quality products that I can depend on.    </li>
            <li>I had high expectations, I guess, but it did not work for me.</li>
            <li>All you have to do is make it through just a little bit of burning sensation, but trust me you will love how your skin feels afterwards.</li>
            <li>After much research, I chose this product to reduce the appearance of dark spots and fine lines on my face.</li>
            <li>Nothing replaces a professional treatment, but doing your part at home really helps your Esthetician or Dermatologist.</li>
            <li>Nothing replaces a professional treatment, but doing your part at home really helps your Esthetician or Dermatologist.</li>
            <li>I made a mistake when placing my order, and he fixed it straight away.</li>
            <li>A couple weeks later the nails pretty much peeled off and, that alone is an improvement.  </li>
            <li>I will be using it to maintain healthy skin in helping to get rid of dead skin cells.</li>
            <li>using the peel a stinging sensation may occur, this is normal</li>
            <li>i have tried it twice now for about 3 - 4 minutes each time and i felt a stinging sensation which is normal from what i read.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use more than a few drops of this product on your face.</li>
            <li>My skin is looking better everyday.</li>
            <li>The prickly and sometimes burning feeling is normal and don&#x27;t worry.</li>
            <li>After this short time, my face felt like your legs do after a fresh shave.</li>
            <li>I was already using a 12% glycolic acid product daily which is pretty much the Holy Grail, so I decided to up it</li>
            <li>you test this on your back of your hand first before applying it on the whole face.</li>
            <li>After a few uses I have noticed that my skin tone appears to be a lot more even.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll update it after a few more treatments.</li>
            <li>I love this one to use between deeper peels since it&#x27;s not as harsh.</li>
            <li>I am pacing around the house fanning my face and trying to seem normal to my husband who said I was a fool for doing it to start with.</li>
            <li>wow, it really reveals new skin.</li>
            <li>It looks very classy and high quality.</li>
            <li>I lasted less than a minute my first time, you may go the full minute.</li>
            <li>Its very mild, I left it on for almost 5 min, but every skin is different.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After subsequent uses, the warm, tingling feeling was not as prevalent as with previous uses.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it for a little less time than suggested, because my skin is sensitive, but I still get great results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>should remember that it takes 1-2 weeks for your skin to regenerate new skin and the results to achieve.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to try this one since it was a new brand.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I felt like the lactic acid peel gave me “new skin” per se.</li>
            <li>but this was all new to me.</li>
            <li>It is very important to do a patch test, applying a small amount to skin to see if there is a reaction.</li>
            <li>It is strong so follow the directions Dr. Song provides - no longer than one minute...or less.  </li>
            <li>I use it before bedtime, and wake up to even skin tone, a glowing complexion, and very soft skin.</li>
            <li>While your results may vary, and taking all indicated precautions, I can recommend this product as gentle enough for facial skin, but strong enough for even calluses on your feet.</li>
            <li>While your results may vary, and taking all indicated precautions, I can recommend this product as gentle enough for facial skin, but strong enough for even calluses on your feet.</li>
            <li>Use it for spot treatments only and don&#x27;t use too much, i.e. follow the instructions on the package!</li>
            <li>I read many comments before I purchased and not many people had complaints.</li>
            <li>This peel is definitely professional grade!  </li>
            <li>My skin is so smooth and yes some of the dark spots are gone in just one application.  </li>
            <li>first off, the price was affordable and i also read that lactic acid doesn&#x27;t actually peel off your skin so that was comforting.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it, I applied it with a cotton ball and left it on for one minute, and then rinsed with water.</li>
            <li>tried other AHA skin peel products before,usually have significant changes</li>
            <li>first time or second time.</li>
            <li>This is professional grade!</li>
            <li>It is recommended to only leave on for 1 minute on your first treatment and going up by one minute each time.</li>
            <li>used it only for 1 minute the first time.</li>
            <li>I left it on for about a minute or two the first time again, then</li>
            <li>Lastly, when I go to repurchase these products, as stated I am slightly more drawn to the lactic acid although it is more expensive</li>
            <li>I applied it as instructed for only one minute the first time you try it.</li>
            <li>but if you do suffer from one, look no further, this stuff really works!</li>
            <li>With the first use, I left the stuff on for about 5 minutes (when it started to burn).</li>
            <li>My face is definitely benefiting - complexion much brighter and vibrant.</li>
            <li>You just rub a small amount onto clean skin with a brush or cotton ball, leave on a minute first time, then increase to 2 eventually if needed.</li>
            <li>Which I honestly reccomend for anyone who doesn&#x27;t have an entire week to hide out in the house while you recover from what looks to be third degree burns with other &amp;#34;peels&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I felt like I had new, soft skin.</li>
            <li>The one dropper full was enough for my entire face.</li>
            <li>The one dropper full was enough for my entire face.</li>
            <li>This bottle contains enough liquid for 15-20 full facial peels.</li>
            <li>It took a couple of uses and healing times to see any real results, but that is also normal since the healing is what helps restore and renew the facial skin.</li>
            <li>I expected my face to be redder after, but luckily that did not occur.</li>
            <li>My dark marks on my face starting to fog away, and my skin looks more youthful.</li>
            <li>I was a little suspicious at first, but I took my time to get used to applying the peel myself and now my peels are basically free since the bottle lasts for quite some time for multiple peels.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t not wait to see how much better my skin gets with time without having to go to the Dr, spend the  big bucks or suffer down time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a very professional product to use, if you are an individual that wants a salon/spa type product that you can use at home.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been given other peels for gifts before and they really didn&#x27;t do the job, but this peel really works wonders!</li>
            <li>Also, inside the large box is the actual Gel Peel.</li>
            <li>One recommendation would definitely be to have the instructions either in the large box (there is plenty of room), or on the bottle itself.</li>
            <li>After first use large dark marks have diminished.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m happy to report that it works well and has already lightened a large, ugly brown spot on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This peel works great on me to remove dead and dull</li>
            <li>I anticipate that continued use will clear up that callus.</li>
            <li>I anticipate that continued use will clear up that callus.</li>
            <li>So while the terms can sound frightful,it really isn&#x27;t all that harsh of a treatment, especially considering that you can buy this over the counter.</li>
            <li>The gel is clear and odorless, so there isn&#x27;t any perfumes or dyes to irritate your skin or senses.    </li>
            <li>I am also hopeful that it helps with some light pink acne scars, but only time will tell!  </li>
            <li>I have used it twice so far and it is definitely professional grade and seems to work quite well.</li>
            <li>I would rather spend 150+ 2-3x a year and get a professional peel.</li>
            <li>Dr. Song also offers a satisfaction guarantee.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also recommended to avoid direct sun exposure for 24 hours.  </li>
            <li>I am 50 years old.</li>
            <li>I had to look at old reviews</li>
            <li>I let a day lapse to make sure my spot did not have a negative reaction.  </li>
            <li>I applied with a cotton ball all over my face, avoiding the sensitive areas like my eyes, lips, and nostrils.  </li>
            <li>It burned the skin near my eye.</li>
            <li>You may want to start with a lower concentration if  your skin is sensitive.  </li>
            <li>But it makes my face incredibly soft</li>
            <li>with the product to take a short survey promising a gift card for Dr.</li>
            <li>My skin looks clearer too from all the years of sun damage from being a young sun worshiper.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since this is a professional Lactic Acid Gel Peel</li>
            <li>sure to keep the peel at least a quarter of an inch away from the eyes and mucus membranes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I see people that look fairly young but they have age spots on their hands</li>
            <li>That being said I can&#x27;t really say what the results are yet because I&#x27;ve only used it once however,</li>
            <li>i have not used a skin peel before so naturally i was scared to use</li>
            <li>My face is still really soft.</li>
            <li>If you DO have really sensitive skin, you might want to try a peel with a lower percentage of lactic acid (20% lactic acid or lower) until you know how your skin will react.    </li>
            <li>but wow does it work my face</li>
            <li>47 year old here.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that I didn&#x27;t have the burning sensation that others have had.</li>
            <li>Of course only do as much time as you need.</li>
            <li>I really feel like the facial peel tackled the redness of my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It’s like a gel, as far as the texture is concerned</li>
            <li>I like using products that are developed to work</li>
            <li>Now here is were it surprised me.</li>
            <li>My pores could breath and my skin was soft.</li>
            <li>So far I like what I see.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend this for people with sensitive skin</li>
            <li>have never done a facial peel before and was very nervous to try it.</li>
            <li>My skin has been extremely soft and radiant looking.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>but second time I wont dilute it so much...</li>
            <li>dang near burst into flames.</li>
            <li>I was cursing at my phone for not going fast enough trying to find out what people had said online about neutralizing because I couldn&#x27;t remember if it was baking soda or baking powder.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a few different Lactic Acid Peels in my days and, personally, I love them.</li>
            <li>I will probably wait a few more days between applications the next go.</li>
            <li>Although my skin is Combination/Oily, I highly recommend it for any skin type, since it is very nourishing and will hydrate Dry skin as well.</li>
            <li>I applied it at night, to give my skin time to cool down while sleeping.</li>
            <li>As with all, or most, new products, just remember to test a small spot on your inner arm before using the product.</li>
            <li>My face has improved so much, I have less wrinkles, and I don&#x27;t even break out as much!</li>
            <li>It is easy to dispense the small amount needed for application.</li>
            <li>A trip to my dermatologist doc costs me about $100, but this bottle is a very small fraction of that cost and gives me better results.</li>
            <li>The first time I used the peel I left it on for only about five minutes.</li>
            <li>red splotches, mainly on my cheekbones and around the corners of my nose.  </li>
            <li>This product is only for people with semi-normal to normal skin.</li>
            <li>and then when the time was done washed it off with cool water and dried my face well with a towel.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Then I rinsed it with cool water and applied a green tea and hyaluronic acid cream.</li>
            <li>After a few minutes I washed my face thoroughly with cool water.</li>
            <li>This facial peel when used properly can improve the look of fine lines, wrinkles, acne scars, age spots, and other skin discolorations.</li>
            <li>I had not heard about the baking soda mix to calm it down or deactivate the peel.  </li>
            <li>so you have a couple days to let your skin calm down before having to go to work or school.</li>
            <li>The product comes in a large blue and white box, and is wrapped in bubble wrap.</li>
            <li>It was a little harsher than this stuff, so I was more careful with it.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>Definitely have a new smoothness to my skin.  </li>
            <li>So there really isn&#x27;t much to fear in using this product unless there is a contraindication, such as pregnancy, skin infections, open wounds, UV sensitive skin (Including those who are currently on a UV sensitizing medications,such as antibiotics), or extemely sensitive skin that you have not patch tested.</li>
            <li>You will notice dark burn marks tour first 2 to 3 days, but after 6-7 days they are completely gone.</li>
            <li>Also unlike green peel oils, you can still wash your skin with mild soaps and take a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon</li>
            <li>After the first day I noticed a visible difference in my sun spots on my upper cheeks and my tiny lines by my eyes are definitely diminished.  </li>
            <li>My face was a little red the next day, but it subsided and by the next day my skin was more even looking.</li>
            <li>First you do a patch test, if no irritation occurs then you can go ahead but do so carefully because face peels can burn!</li>
            <li>I have tested a few different items and I am never disappointed.</li>
            <li>how long you need the product on to make certain areas peel because all parts of your face are different in sensitivity and skin</li>
            <li>so your face has a chance to recover a little before entering civilization again, but really, that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li>I had seen reviews of Lactic Acid peels in general stating that 1.</li>
            <li>The chemicals dissolve the bond between the old skin cells and the newer, younger cells beneath.</li>
            <li>I could barely stand the burning and stinging</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this peel twice so far</li>
            <li>Put a dab behind your ears and wait 48 hours to make sure that you aren&#x27;t allergic to any of the ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for the past 3 months as I wanted to wait a bit to see the true results before I review this product.</li>
            <li>Although my skin is Combination/Oily, I highly recommend it for any skin type, since it is very nourishing and will hydrate Dry skin as well.oo early to post photos, but perhaps I will revisit and post some down the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin peeled a few days later and my complexion looked more even with some slight fading of old acnescars.</li>
            <li>If you want results and are willing to experience a slight discomfort, this product is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>To my shock, my entire mouth and nose had done some major peeling overnight!</li>
            <li>Lastly, I saw no positive results; the only thing I received was a burn on my first use.</li>
            <li>It is extremely important to avoid the eye area, applying at least 1/2 inch away from the entire eye socket.</li>
            <li>It is extremely important to avoid the eye area, applying at least 1/2 inch away from the entire eye socket.</li>
            <li>after the first application I was not sure if it made any difference, but I&#x27;ve had 4 peels so far</li>
            <li>It was replaced with a much lighter spot, but much better than having the aging brown spot that was driving me crazy.  </li>
            <li>Remember, these are general guidelines, and everyone’s skin is different.</li>
            <li>and it has helped a lot including making a noticeable difference in the texture of my hands and getting rid of some dark spots from getting too much sun that  I had on my legs.</li>
            <li>The first application did remove dried patches and soften the area.</li>
            <li>Glycolic Peel is much stronger and a lot of women love it for its Anti-aging properties, but I find it too harsh and irritating.</li>
            <li>My skin is so much smoother, less oily and no dry patches.</li>
            <li>I left the product on until it felt a little hot and washed it off with a runny mixture of baking soda and water.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s happening with that, I am still using the product to see if it will improve with a few more uses with time.</li>
            <li>The first time, I applied it for 2 minutes, it caused my skin to sting, and it turned to red, but it only lasted for few hours.</li>
            <li>A little one page sheet with a disclaimer may prove to be very beneficial.</li>
            <li>I used a new flat, wide, paint brush from Michael’s.  </li>
            <li>You just put a little tiny bit on a cotton ball and apply it to your face and neck (avoiding the eyes and sensitive areas completely).</li>
            <li>It worked abit to clear some of the discolouration but not to the extend I expected, and I notice that since I&#x27;ve started using the peel  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Dr song was great.</li>
            <li> I know it is going to take time, but I am happy to see even the slightest results.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great product if you want smoother and brighter skin.</li>
            <li> This face peel is supposed to be great for wrinkles, hyperpigmentation, scars...</li>
            <li> Either way this peel stimulates collagen production so it is a great step before moving on to stronger peels like TCA or phenol.</li>
            <li> Happy I tried it and should have done it sooner.</li>
            <li> Great Buy</li>
            <li> Arrived on time great packaging.</li>
            <li> Which in turns means more age spots!!</li>
            <li> Very nice quality and thickness to it.</li>
            <li> and the end result is amazing!</li>
            <li> Amazing!  </li>
            <li> I have used most all of the products that Dr Song sells- very good products and affordable too!</li>
            <li> I love to use products because I want that perfect skin</li>
            <li> &amp; I could do it on my own time!</li>
            <li> You are guaranteed bright, clearer, tighter skin after just one application.</li>
            <li> This dries out your skin so use a good face cream.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with how smooth my skin was after I used this chemical peel.</li>
            <li> Then you should be good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (which is good-</li>
            <li> Theres no peeling,  which is good.</li>
            <li> Lactic acid peels are good for hyperpigmentation and age/sun spots.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to have something effective for home.</li>
            <li> good things-</li>
            <li> it fells good too..</li>
            <li> Good, does the job and is affordable.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m good with this &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; acid.</li>
            <li> Happy shopping :)</li>
            <li> Very pleased with immediate results.</li>
            <li> GREAT PEEL FOR PEOPLE WHO LOVE</li>
            <li> Great Product ... love it</li>
            <li> Let it be known that this stuff POTENT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already satisfied with my purchase!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Stings like the dickens, that&#x27;s for sure!  </li>
            <li> Use a moisturizer with a 30 SPF sunscreen for sure!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I tried it anyway!  </li>
            <li> It feels more radiant!</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> As another reviewer stated if applied on a pimple it will greatly reduce the size very quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had amazing results with just a couple uses.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> My skin is bright and healthy.</li>
            <li> product is amazing and will make your skin feel amazing.</li>
            <li> This is a great light peel.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s effective</li>
            <li> There is a warning on the bottle to Use at your own risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As it said &#x27;Use at your own risk&#x27;, but it might be just the thing to help your skin look and feel better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> As it said &#x27;Use at your own risk&#x27;, but it might be just the thing to help your skin look and feel better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I wouldn&#x27;t have wanted to go out to a nice dinner or anything with it looking like that.  </li>
            <li> All that junk they sell in salons and stores, smells nice but doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> I did it myself and in my own bathroom!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I peeled nicely.</li>
            <li> Today, chemical peels have evolved to include take-home peels and kits, allowing you to reap their benefits in the privacy of your own home.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*I was sent this item for review, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> They sent me glycoluc acid by mistake, so I don&#x27;t really know how to rate this, but I thought the glycoluc acid was wonderful.</li>
            <li> and I would never post an opinion that wasn&#x27;t my own.</li>
            <li> Honestly I have never herd of anything called a peel.</li>
            <li> However, it is doing what it should and people are noticing that my skin looks nice.</li>
            <li> There is great customer service and this product is very reasonably priced and a good product/peel.</li>
            <li> This is a very strong peel that works amazingly, it needs to come with directions though.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent value, and high quality.</li>
            <li> I did receive this product for free to try out, but these are my own unbiased opinions!</li>
            <li> I will be a loyal and happy customer from now on.</li>
            <li> Again, this is very strong, so you should do a skin patch test</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very strong</li>
            <li> I am an Esthetician and this is very strong.</li>
            <li> , so you bet I was thrilled when I was able to review Dr. Song&#x27;s Lactic Acid peel in 50%.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best product for the price.</li>
            <li> I have a fair (light) complexion and have been using a 2% solution of retinol</li>
            <li> ( I had read somewhere in one review that it helps calm the stinging sensation ) and it felt great.</li>
            <li> clear instructions, great product!</li>
            <li> Great customer service and the price is right.</li>
            <li> This stuff is strong!</li>
            <li> it’s strong!</li>
            <li> This is some strong stuff!</li>
            <li> I also think a good sunscreen that we should be using anyways.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great idea that if you have a special event don&#x27;t use this product right before.  </li>
            <li> It leaves a very smooth to the touch face.</li>
            <li> The good thing is it takes 1 minute and produces huge, noticeable results, so it&#x27;s very quick gratification.</li>
            <li> In addition, because lactic acid peels can cause skin to become very sensitive to sun light, winter is the perfect time to try them out.</li>
            <li> Also include a tutorial video on the website :)</li>
            <li> Listen to instructions and don&#x27;t keep it on for more than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> but you have to know how to stop the burn :-)</li>
            <li> My kids and husband noticed without me even saying a thing :)</li>
            <li> I love peels</li>
            <li> are many benefits in a peel of this form because it provides a deeper exfoliation.  </li>
            <li> Within four days the skin healed and the top layer peeled off.</li>
            <li> Works fantastic!</li>
            <li> I knew Dr Song was a reputable brand in the teeth whitening department, and I&#x27;m so glad they have expanded into skin</li>
            <li> After which, I noticed that my skin is luminous, more even skin tone, and pigmentation started to fade</li>
            <li> I am so in love with Dr. Song products, including the Vitamin C/Hyralounic Acid serum.  </li>
            <li> Now if only they would create a product with Retinol/Retinoids, they would have a perfect trifecta of skin products.  </li>
            <li> Enjoying using.</li>
            <li> I love all Dr. Song products.  </li>
            <li> Works better than glycolic acid.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s permanent, but it&#x27;s not there any more.  </li>
            <li> I do feel they should give you better, more thorough instructions on the products.</li>
            <li> Skin look measurably better after one week.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> not apply the peel more than once in a 7 day period&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;LOVE, LOVE,</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels after I use my peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You’ll find that your beauty creams and serums will work better when you add Dr Song to your beauty routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> TO LOVE</li>
            <li> You’ll find that your beauty creams and serums will work better when you add Dr Song to your beauty routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> TO LOVE</li>
            <li> My skin is more even and supple.</li>
            <li> Keep up the fantastic work!</li>
            <li> So I bought two bottles many months ago and put them away and just never got around to using them.</li>
            <li> it shipped fast - which is really great.</li>
            <li> Make sure to wash your face before and after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li> sure to test this out on your hand before applying to your face.</li>
            <li> I love the Dr. Song product line.</li>
            <li> Make sure to do the skin test.</li>
            <li> I used the Googles to get better instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I planned to keep using them more often</li>
            <li> I found mixed reviews that both impressed and terrified me.    </li>
            <li> 70% Glycolic  is a better option and use by dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed testing this product and seeing what it has done for my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say how it works with that, but it made my skin glowy and smooth!</li>
            <li> Hopefully I will be able to work up to a couple of minutes at a time.</li>
            <li> I do recommend you make sure you do it on a day you aren&#x27;t going out at all or at night before bed</li>
            <li> (that will make it peel more).</li>
            <li> My skin is much more healthy looking</li>
            <li> I just love how my skin looks after using this peel.</li>
            <li> I look forward to using this product - something that I can&#x27;t say for most skin products.</li>
            <li> If you do apply it all over, make sure to not get close to your eyes.</li>
            <li> This is so much more inexpensive than going to the dermatologist and paying lots of money</li>

            <li> I may just experiment with the areas that have the most freckles.</li>
            <li> I will however, use the product much more often than once a month.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m confident that it will continue to soften my skin and slough freckles and fade malasma.  </li>
            <li> I used it mostly on my chin where scarring is from plucking hairs.</li>
            <li> Will just do it more often to get the results I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product, and I expect to see more results.</li>
            <li> Using this acid for 3rd time, it is great!!</li>
            <li> And I love the price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> The skin around my nose (like many) is getting too  sensitive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My confident level was none.</li>
            <li> I am so confident I no longer have to put concealer under my chin.</li>
            <li> The rest of my skin looks much better too.</li>
            <li> that I&#x27;m sure more uses will rectify</li>
            <li> I washed it off and felt better.</li>
            <li> This product arrived right on time and in good condition.</li>
            <li> DO a Skin Patch Test FIRST!!!  </li>
            <li> I was very excited when I received this peel for review.</li>
            <li> I was very excited, but nervous to try this peel as I have never used a peel before.</li>
            <li> It took about a full week for these to go away, and now that my skin has had time to rest the results are FANTASTIC!!  </li>
            <li> I first did a &amp;#34;spot test&amp;#34;  and after 45 seconds, I felt that was my good start point.  </li>
            <li> I just started doing peels recently and they are amazing!!</li>
            <li> It has been a week now and my skin looks better and feels smooth.</li>
            <li> Great product for when you lack the time (&amp; the money) to go have a professional peel.  </li>
            <li> I became more comfortable using it.</li>
            <li> Its just so much younger looking, brighter, more beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> A good friend recommended it, but it didn&#x27;t do much for me.  </li>
            <li> I have to say Dr. OZ was right!!</li>
            <li> Great product arrived quickly and seems to be the real deal.</li>
            <li> Pretty good for the price, I tried a more expensive brand; #1 Best Seller on Amazon for $34.00 and this worked just as good.</li>
            <li> I didn’t even make it a full minute before I had to rinse my face!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIRST and foremost!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to say that after only one use of this peel I noticed a huge difference!</li>
            <li> Easy to use,</li>
            <li> It was easy to do</li>
            <li> I never understand why celebrities that are older but still look really good have age spots on their hands.</li>
            <li> too strong for me...</li>
            <li> and I used it twice not as strong</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have fine lines or wrinkles or sun spots</li>
            <li> All seemed fine, so I proceeded to use the product as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have some acne scarring on my cheeks as well as a fine line on my forehead</li>
            <li> I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li> I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t fear, I used good old Google and found them!</li>
            <li> Its not a dramatic change, but it does strech your sking nicely and pumps it up a bit afterwards.  </li>
            <li> It is very strong so be cautious using it on the first try.</li>
            <li> and I already see a huge difference in my skin..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> Inside is a card noting that the detailed instructions on usage have been sent to the email associated with the Amazon account.</li>
            <li> Their products are really intense and effective.</li>
            <li> Great for resurfacing of the skin, cleaning out debris from pores and especially beneficial for mature/aging skin.  </li>
            <li> Great for fading finer lines and improving overall the look of your skin.  </li>
            <li> I washed it off and noticed how smooth my skin felt.</li>
            <li> It is gentle and effective for at home use.</li>
            <li> It is gentle and effective for at home use.</li>
            <li> monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation).</li>
            <li> This is a great product to use at home instead of spending a lot of money on salons for the same peeling product.</li>
            <li> It has a light scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently leaving it on for 4minutes and feels great.</li>
            <li> I get some light tingling while using but nothing, not even redness, after washing off.</li>
            <li> I dumped some baking soda in the bathroom sink and filled it with water.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product wise - It&#x27;s too early for me to say anything as I have used peels before</li>
            <li> And so far, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> it was easy and quick to do the peel, and 3.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super strong and produces a burning sensation when you&#x27;re using it.</li>
            <li> Received item quickly and instructions were easy to follow.</li>
            <li> Works well and is more gentle as a gel rather than lactic acid!  </li>
            <li> Been using for like 3 weeks, 2 times a week and can see a significant difference.</li>
            <li> I love that this product now comes in dropper form, which makes measuring and dispensing the product much easier!  </li>
            <li> I have only used it twice and can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve seen remarkable results yet.</li>
            <li> so I meticulously followed the instructions sent by mail, applied this gel twice a week and 3-4 days after every peel I&#x27;ve been excited to notice that my underarms were atleast 2 shades lighter.</li>
            <li> I love being able to use a professional product at home.  </li>
            <li> Very good for blemishes and uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Things I highly recommend are to really really stay out of the sun after a peel, slather good moisturizer on your face (don&#x27;t skimp), and try not to wash your face for a day or two (after neutralizing the acid).  </li>
            <li> I reccomend a gentle exfoliant because you want it to heal the bottom layer of skin before scrubbing off the top layer .  </li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.carefully applied to my face.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> skin irritation occurs remove the product by neutralizing with cool water immediately and consult a physician.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I want to really get the top layer of sun damaged skin off of my hands and keep this up</li>
            <li> only downside was that it didn&#x27;t come with good instructions.  </li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this to anyone who wants better looking skin</li>
            <li> I lasted about a minute and rinsed off in cool water and then moisturized and went to sleep.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> Dr. Song&#x27;s Lactic Acid Gel Peel works just like any professional peel and you can do it in the comfort of your own</li>
            <li> If it begins to irritate your skin or feel like it is burning, it is recommended to rinse your face with cool water to neutralize it.  </li>
            <li> I really liked this and would recommend it to people who don&#x27;t have overly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> And the following day a friend commented and asked if I had done something to my face because it looked good..</li>
            <li> And I can really say my skin locks so much better.</li>
            <li> Dr Song 50% Lactic Acid Peel is a professional grade peel that you can do in the comfort of your own home.</li>
            <li> Not bad..</li>
            <li> , also most importantly, I use Khiel&#x27;s 50 SPF facial sunscreen on the top of my hands always, luckily I don&#x27;t have any spots</li>
            <li> and boy did my face feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> will definitely do another application but will wait a couple more weeks and not leave on more than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> I know some people get scared off by the main ingredient, named &amp;#34;Lactic Acid&amp;#34; and then on top of that it follows with &amp;#34;Face Peel&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This particular peel is Fantastic!</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and as described.</li>
            <li> so when the 3 minutes were up, I quickly rinsed it off with water.</li>
            <li> This product was provided to me for testing and review purposes, but I would never endorse something that I didn&#x27;t believe was worthy of it</li>
            <li> I had never tried a lactic acid face peel prior to being chosen for the Dr Song 50% Lactic Acid Face Peel promotion, I was given the product for free in return for an honest product</li>
            <li> I Purchased this peel this week, delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> but it went away quickly</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> However, I found it mild in conjunction with retin A, but then again i&#x27;m treating my neck area.</li>
            <li> It gets rid of any imperfections, but it&#x27;s very strong and not for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lactic acid is an alpha hydroxy acid that is mild and suitable even for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> And it is important that you follow the instructions exactly.</li>
            <li> And it is important that you follow the instructions exactly.</li>
            <li> The very first time I just tried it in one area for about 1 minute.  </li>
            <li> It is great for hyper-pigmentations and dark spots.</li>
            <li> Then, 2-3 days after I received the product got a strange email that was more about ordering more than instructions on how to use.  </li>
            <li> Austin helped with all my questions about the peels and took great care of me as there new and future customer.&lt;br</li>

            <li> If you&#x27;re anything like me and don&#x27;t want to spend big bucks or rather just do it in the comfort of your own home, I would recommend trying this peel.</li>
            <li> It’s like starting with a clean canvas!!</li>
            <li> It’s like starting with a clean canvas!!</li>
            <li> It also makes your skin brighter right after using it, kinda like it&#x27;s been illuminated from within.</li>
            <li> I am still hoping that I am using it right.  </li>
            <li> I used  the vitamin C serum  right after.</li>
            <li> I have tried other lactic acid peels and I think this product is far superior!  </li>
            <li> So far, I am pretty pleased.</li>
            <li> is great for wrinkles, hyperpigmentation, scars, and so many other things because it reveals new skin completely.</li>
            <li> they DO all work differently and they are very strong and can do damage without knowing what to do specifically.</li>
            <li> skin is getting super soft and smooth</li>
            <li> This is very affordable, considering how strong it is and how much you get.</li>
            <li> The acid is derived from milk and considered to be mild when it comes to irritations and used in &amp;#34;peel/mask&amp;#34; form by many, and especially first-time users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was gentle, easy to apply, only used a small amount, and, best of all, it worked well.</li>
            <li> It was gentle, easy to apply, only used a small amount, and, best of all, it worked well.</li>
            <li> Certain areas of the face you have to be more careful like around your mouth because it&#x27;ll get more red, but I love it.</li>
            <li> Also, quick shipping and emailed instructions helped the process go much smoother.</li>
            <li> I am not new to this kind of thing.</li>
            <li> a very large notch and first try the 40% glycolic acid.</li>
            <li> one is pretty strong so if you have sensitive skin, I would start with something weaker.  </li>
            <li> Lactic acid is derived from Milk and is very gentle.</li>
            <li> I did follow up with a very gentle  moisturizer after.</li>
            <li> bottle is a pretty little glass bottle that contains a good amount of the peel.</li>
            <li> New cells means the signs of aging, wrinkles, crow’s feet, fine lines and dark patches, disappear, and give your skin a youthful AMAZING glow!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First, this is not a &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My first time with this type of peel and it burned quite a bit.</li>
            <li> first peel let me know I can increase the time to one minute</li>
            <li> and I did just that and started seeing results with my second peel, which were more noticeable.  </li>
            <li> when I first applied).&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally, I really like this Lactic Peel, because it is gentle enough to use at home, yet still effective at helping increase cell turnover to reveal visible improvements in my skin.</li>
            <li> My first peel</li>
            <li> I got this when it first came out as an introductory price on Amazon, I believe it was 6.99 a bottle.</li>
            <li> I decided to start using the serum because I&#x27;m starting to pay more attention to my hands</li>
            <li> this review is to let everyone know that I left it on the top of both my hands for five minutes, I did not burn at all, then I washed it off.</li>
            <li> I was able to order 3 bottles of Dr. Song vs 1 bottle of the former product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product was my first foray into self-peeling.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently discovered Dr. Song products and I&#x27;ve fallen in love with them.</li>
            <li> Read the directions first...</li>
            <li> I have seen people spend thousands of dollars on chemical peels, and they really don&#x27;t have to do that!</li>
            <li> Definitely stung a bit more.</li>
            <li> The warm, tingling sensation lasted a lot longer than I had expected in that</li>
            <li> was said in the instructions that your first time it might burn.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipment ..!</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly as instructed in an email to me.</li>
            <li> I unwrapped the bottle and the first thing I noticed was that it didn&#x27;t come with directions.</li>
            <li> So I went ahead and applied my first peel.</li>
            <li> I applied it for a minute as suggested for the first time use.</li>
            <li> and I notice that my face is looking more even toned and younger.</li>
            <li> Three weeks later I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> of course I had to diluted it first time around..</li>
            <li> Years later my husband who always supportive told me that he saw on dr oz that lactic peels helps eliminate scars and lighten skin.</li>
            <li> I did break out a bit after my first treatment</li>
            <li> Haha!</li>
            <li> However in about 20 minutes (that is 20 minutes after I washed it off during my first use) my face</li>
            <li> Once the first time finished up, I tried again.</li>
            <li> Available in several percentages from a mild 20% to higher ones like 50% to 70%.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this 3 times and I&#x27;m already noticing a difference as my skin is super smooth.  </li>
            <li> I refuse to pay to get a peel professionally because its highway robbery, but at the same time I haven&#x27;t found many products that are budget friendly that I TRUST.</li>
            <li> Make sure you cut the gel with a little bit of lotion and rinse it off as soon as it \\&quot;tingles.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free to review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m continuing to use it and hopefully will have some positive results after several more uses.</li>
            <li> Song products could be priced a LOT higher due to their amazing ability to fulfil their promises.</li>
            <li> This is by far the most professional peel I have ever had!</li>
            <li> It almost has a very slight &#x27;brown sugar&#x27; type odor (which I love), and the gel like consistency makes it easy to apply to the face.  </li>
            <li> the peel is amazing follow those directions very very carefully</li>
            <li> Since I’m sensitive about what products I use on my face, the fact that I liked the results I felt after using Dr. Song’s Lactic Acid Facial Peel say a lot.</li>
            <li> and it’s much lighter of a feel than most facial peels.</li>
            <li> Very strong, so  be careful and follow directions.</li>
            <li> The smell is quite strong when you first open it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand all the positive reviews here.</li>
            <li> I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all).</li>
            <li> I was really scared to try this at first because I didn&#x27;t want to be walking around with peeling blotchy skin.  </li>
            <li> It is super easy to use, just take a cotton ball and spread it over the face being careful not to layer over what has already been covered</li>
            <li> At first I was a little scared when I read &amp;#34;use at your own risk&amp;#34; on the label, but then I read through some of the reviews and didn&#x27;t see anything about skin irritation</li>
            <li> it is very important to use sunscreen and stay out of the sun for at least 24 hours since your skin can burn easily after using.  </li>
            <li> Like with any acid peel, as long as you read the directions and follow them carefully, you should be happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> Like with any acid peel, as long as you read the directions and follow them carefully, you should be happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> As long as you follow the directions and use common sense, this is a wonderful peel.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone that doesn&#x27;t have super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I see the price is already a bit more so we&#x27;ll see what my threshold is on how much I&#x27;m willing to spend once this bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> If you expose your skin to the sun you MUST apply sunscreen because your skin will be super sensitive to exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think there should be directions that come with this peel, especially being that it is so strong.</li>
            <li> The smell is strong but not overpowering, it&#x27;s definitely bearable.</li>
            <li> This is purely because I remember Samantha from Sex and the City after her chemical peel disaster.</li>
            <li> and I know that some can be weak sometimes, but Dr. Song&#x27;s peel is definitely one of the best i&#x27;ve ordered on amazon.</li>
            <li> but it really did address a large portion of the newer scars.</li>
            <li> Before I go into the review, below is a little information on the acid and my non-professional steps when I do my own</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t come with any real applicator</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t afford a real peel, try it I suppose.</li>
            <li> If you can afford the real thing, skip this.</li>
            <li> I waited 60 seconds and removed gently with soap and water.</li>
            <li> My only recommendation is that Dr. Song Medicals include detailed instructions with each product.</li>

            <li> My only recommendation is that Dr. Song Medicals include detailed instructions with each product.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll want to use an intense moisturizer after this to reveal even softer, smoother skin.</li>
            <li> I was really scared to try this lactic acid face peel.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed, especially since I&#x27;m going light with it</li>
            <li> My only con is that the directions are not included with the product and are e-mailed, also available on their website.  </li>
            <li> received the above product(s) free of charge from Dr. Song.  </li>
            <li> My only con is that the directions are not included with the product and are e-mailed, also available on their website.  </li>
            <li> received the above product(s) free of charge from Dr. Song.  </li>
            <li> I was very scared I permanently damaged my skin and my eyes.</li>
            <li> As soon as I put it on my face it started to burn intensely</li>
            <li> This is the real deal.</li>
            <li> My skin burned much , I could not use the product.</li>
            <li> You should also know how a chemical peel works is similar to a good exfoliation or microdermabrasion, except that it is not a physical sloughing of the top dead layer of skin cells.</li>
            <li> All of my freckles are gone thanks to Dr. Song&#x27;s solution.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment</li>
            <li> I feel there should be detailed instructions with every individual peel-</li>
            <li> I tried to find a website - but couldn&#x27;t find too much??</li>
            <li> I just hope the price does not rise so much it becomes too</li>
            <li> This is absolutely perfect!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product works as a gentle peel.  </li>
            <li> and it just really looks unattractive and shows their age.</li>
            <li> but there was no burning, it was very tolerable.</li>
            <li> The serum has a very sticky feel to it and quite a stronger scent than I am use to.</li>
            <li> The real deal.</li>
            <li> I first tried Dr. Song’s Lactic Acid Facial Peel, using the directions I found on their website, I was not surprised by the warm, tingling sensation I felt.</li>
            <li> the lactic acid came, I was determined to make my whole face peel.  </li>
            <li> This really made my nose and chin blister up.  </li>
            <li> I used an intense moisturizer and it revealed softer and smoother skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have a lot experience with these kinds of products</li>
            <li> My face was really tingling</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried a dozen home remedies before, nothing really helped.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> I had my daughter about a year ago and my whole pregnancy</li>
            <li> This time I was ready with the baking soda ahead of time.</li>
            <li> Still burned, and still felt like sand, but I was ready.</li>
            <li> Buffed off flakey skin the next day and ski was soft and better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to use this product twice in the last month, since I am also still doing Professional treatments at the spa where I work.</li>
            <li> Will surely buy again in the near future.</li>
            <li> It is kind of weird because it is a gel it just sits on top of your skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Warning: Use at your own risk (For external use only).</li>
            <li> My skin is already soft but after each use my skin felt like my sons cheeks :) only noticeable change.</li>
            <li> peel has worked to get rid of old acne scars and marks on my face and my skin tone is more even and pores seem smaller.</li>
            <li> - I decided to apply the acid once again on my skin, this time I tried it on the right cheek again, this time only for 6 minutes, and then the right cheek for 8 minutes.  </li>
            <li> This was my first lactic acid peel and I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> The first time I saw a huge improvement in texture, and brightness and the second peel slightly burned my face and was red for a day but looked great the next day.</li>
            <li> Over time your pores become clogged and you need something stronger than a facial cleaner to clean out those pores.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and cant wait to see how much more my dark spots will get lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pretty excited to see what the second peel offers.</li>
            <li> The packaging was very sturdy and the bottle is made of high quality materials.</li>
            <li> - Applied Solution to a small part of right cheek that had an aging brown-spot 10 mm in length for something like 15 minutes or more.  </li>
            <li> and I honestly can already see a slight reduction so far.</li>
            <li> I love that Dr Song Medical products are made in the USA and is FDA compliant and a provider of professional products that focus on natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> 15-20 full facial peels (30 nl/ 1 oz)&lt;br /&gt;Comes with 365 Day&lt;br /&gt;100%</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t apply this more than once every week, but I use it even less than that.</li>
            <li> and I then used a mild facial wash to deactivate the acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put ice on it the next day also, but by the next day it started looking better.</li>
            <li> Peels can increase your skin’s sensitivity to the sun and particularly the possibility of sunburn.</li>
            <li> I use it on my knees and my heels and sure enough about 1-2 weeks later that area is peeling.  </li>
            <li> By the way I am battling Acne Scars, so this is the main reason I wanted to review this product.</li>
            <li> It has the classic shiny silver Dr. Song label.</li>
            <li> I have freckles since I was born, mainly on both cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Just make sure that you read all of the directions online clearly and follow them carefully.</li>
            <li> There is still some scarring that was older</li>
            <li> Its strong so follow the directions carefully.</li>
            <li> really feel that if you follow the directions that the product is pretty easy to use, I really like the product and am less afraid of using the product more and more.</li>
            <li> It just made sense to me to try their gel peel because they make high quality products that I can depend on.    </li>
            <li> I had high expectations, I guess, but it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> All you have to do is make it through just a little bit of burning sensation, but trust me you will love how your skin feels afterwards.</li>
            <li> After much research, I chose this product to reduce the appearance of dark spots and fine lines on my face.</li>
            <li> Nothing replaces a professional treatment, but doing your part at home really helps your Esthetician or Dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Nothing replaces a professional treatment, but doing your part at home really helps your Esthetician or Dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I made a mistake when placing my order, and he fixed it straight away.</li>
            <li> A couple weeks later the nails pretty much peeled off and, that alone is an improvement.  </li>
            <li> I will be using it to maintain healthy skin in helping to get rid of dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> using the peel a stinging sensation may occur, this is normal</li>
            <li> i have tried it twice now for about 3 - 4 minutes each time and i felt a stinging sensation which is normal from what i read.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use more than a few drops of this product on your face.</li>
            <li> My skin is looking better everyday.</li>
            <li> The prickly and sometimes burning feeling is normal and don&#x27;t worry.</li>
            <li> After this short time, my face felt like your legs do after a fresh shave.</li>
            <li> I was already using a 12% glycolic acid product daily which is pretty much the Holy Grail, so I decided to up it</li>
            <li> you test this on your back of your hand first before applying it on the whole face.</li>
            <li> After a few uses I have noticed that my skin tone appears to be a lot more even.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll update it after a few more treatments.</li>
            <li> I love this one to use between deeper peels since it&#x27;s not as harsh.</li>
            <li> I am pacing around the house fanning my face and trying to seem normal to my husband who said I was a fool for doing it to start with.</li>
            <li> wow, it really reveals new skin.</li>
            <li> It looks very classy and high quality.</li>
            <li> I lasted less than a minute my first time, you may go the full minute.</li>
            <li> Its very mild, I left it on for almost 5 min, but every skin is different.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After subsequent uses, the warm, tingling feeling was not as prevalent as with previous uses.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it for a little less time than suggested, because my skin is sensitive, but I still get great results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> should remember that it takes 1-2 weeks for your skin to regenerate new skin and the results to achieve.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try this one since it was a new brand.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I felt like the lactic acid peel gave me “new skin” per se.</li>
            <li> but this was all new to me.</li>
            <li> It is very important to do a patch test, applying a small amount to skin to see if there is a reaction.</li>
            <li> It is strong so follow the directions Dr. Song provides - no longer than one minute...or less.  </li>
            <li> I use it before bedtime, and wake up to even skin tone, a glowing complexion, and very soft skin.</li>
            <li> While your results may vary, and taking all indicated precautions, I can recommend this product as gentle enough for facial skin, but strong enough for even calluses on your feet.</li>
            <li> While your results may vary, and taking all indicated precautions, I can recommend this product as gentle enough for facial skin, but strong enough for even calluses on your feet.</li>
            <li> Use it for spot treatments only and don&#x27;t use too much, i.e. follow the instructions on the package!</li>
            <li> I read many comments before I purchased and not many people had complaints.</li>
            <li> This peel is definitely professional grade!  </li>
            <li> My skin is so smooth and yes some of the dark spots are gone in just one application.  </li>
            <li> first off, the price was affordable and i also read that lactic acid doesn&#x27;t actually peel off your skin so that was comforting.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it, I applied it with a cotton ball and left it on for one minute, and then rinsed with water.</li>
            <li> tried other AHA skin peel products before,usually have significant changes</li>
            <li> first time or second time.</li>
            <li> This is professional grade!</li>
            <li> It is recommended to only leave on for 1 minute on your first treatment and going up by one minute each time.</li>
            <li> used it only for 1 minute the first time.</li>
            <li> I left it on for about a minute or two the first time again, then</li>
            <li> Lastly, when I go to repurchase these products, as stated I am slightly more drawn to the lactic acid although it is more expensive</li>
            <li> I applied it as instructed for only one minute the first time you try it.</li>
            <li> but if you do suffer from one, look no further, this stuff really works!</li>
            <li> With the first use, I left the stuff on for about 5 minutes (when it started to burn).</li>
            <li> My face is definitely benefiting - complexion much brighter and vibrant.</li>
            <li> You just rub a small amount onto clean skin with a brush or cotton ball, leave on a minute first time, then increase to 2 eventually if needed.</li>
            <li> Which I honestly reccomend for anyone who doesn&#x27;t have an entire week to hide out in the house while you recover from what looks to be third degree burns with other &amp;#34;peels&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I felt like I had new, soft skin.</li>
            <li> The one dropper full was enough for my entire face.</li>
            <li> The one dropper full was enough for my entire face.</li>
            <li> This bottle contains enough liquid for 15-20 full facial peels.</li>
            <li> It took a couple of uses and healing times to see any real results, but that is also normal since the healing is what helps restore and renew the facial skin.</li>
            <li> I expected my face to be redder after, but luckily that did not occur.</li>
            <li> My dark marks on my face starting to fog away, and my skin looks more youthful.</li>
            <li> I was a little suspicious at first, but I took my time to get used to applying the peel myself and now my peels are basically free since the bottle lasts for quite some time for multiple peels.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t not wait to see how much better my skin gets with time without having to go to the Dr, spend the  big bucks or suffer down time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a very professional product to use, if you are an individual that wants a salon/spa type product that you can use at home.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been given other peels for gifts before and they really didn&#x27;t do the job, but this peel really works wonders!</li>
            <li> Also, inside the large box is the actual Gel Peel.</li>
            <li> One recommendation would definitely be to have the instructions either in the large box (there is plenty of room), or on the bottle itself.</li>
            <li> After first use large dark marks have diminished.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m happy to report that it works well and has already lightened a large, ugly brown spot on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This peel works great on me to remove dead and dull</li>
            <li> I anticipate that continued use will clear up that callus.</li>
            <li> I anticipate that continued use will clear up that callus.</li>
            <li> So while the terms can sound frightful,it really isn&#x27;t all that harsh of a treatment, especially considering that you can buy this over the counter.</li>
            <li> The gel is clear and odorless, so there isn&#x27;t any perfumes or dyes to irritate your skin or senses.    </li>
            <li> I am also hopeful that it helps with some light pink acne scars, but only time will tell!  </li>
            <li> I have used it twice so far and it is definitely professional grade and seems to work quite well.</li>
            <li> I would rather spend 150+ 2-3x a year and get a professional peel.</li>
            <li> Dr. Song also offers a satisfaction guarantee.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also recommended to avoid direct sun exposure for 24 hours.  </li>
            <li> I am 50 years old.</li>
            <li> I had to look at old reviews</li>
            <li> I let a day lapse to make sure my spot did not have a negative reaction.  </li>
            <li> I applied with a cotton ball all over my face, avoiding the sensitive areas like my eyes, lips, and nostrils.  </li>
            <li> It burned the skin near my eye.</li>
            <li> You may want to start with a lower concentration if  your skin is sensitive.  </li>
            <li> But it makes my face incredibly soft</li>
            <li> with the product to take a short survey promising a gift card for Dr.</li>
            <li> My skin looks clearer too from all the years of sun damage from being a young sun worshiper.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since this is a professional Lactic Acid Gel Peel</li>
            <li> sure to keep the peel at least a quarter of an inch away from the eyes and mucus membranes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I see people that look fairly young but they have age spots on their hands</li>
            <li> That being said I can&#x27;t really say what the results are yet because I&#x27;ve only used it once however,</li>
            <li> i have not used a skin peel before so naturally i was scared to use</li>
            <li> My face is still really soft.</li>
            <li> If you DO have really sensitive skin, you might want to try a peel with a lower percentage of lactic acid (20% lactic acid or lower) until you know how your skin will react.    </li>
            <li> but wow does it work my face</li>
            <li> 47 year old here.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that I didn&#x27;t have the burning sensation that others have had.</li>
            <li> Of course only do as much time as you need.</li>
            <li> I really feel like the facial peel tackled the redness of my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It’s like a gel, as far as the texture is concerned</li>
            <li> I like using products that are developed to work</li>
            <li> Now here is were it surprised me.</li>
            <li> My pores could breath and my skin was soft.</li>
            <li> So far I like what I see.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this for people with sensitive skin</li>
            <li> have never done a facial peel before and was very nervous to try it.</li>
            <li> My skin has been extremely soft and radiant looking.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> but second time I wont dilute it so much...</li>
            <li> dang near burst into flames.</li>
            <li> I was cursing at my phone for not going fast enough trying to find out what people had said online about neutralizing because I couldn&#x27;t remember if it was baking soda or baking powder.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a few different Lactic Acid Peels in my days and, personally, I love them.</li>
            <li> I will probably wait a few more days between applications the next go.</li>
            <li> Although my skin is Combination/Oily, I highly recommend it for any skin type, since it is very nourishing and will hydrate Dry skin as well.</li>
            <li> I applied it at night, to give my skin time to cool down while sleeping.</li>
            <li> As with all, or most, new products, just remember to test a small spot on your inner arm before using the product.</li>
            <li> My face has improved so much, I have less wrinkles, and I don&#x27;t even break out as much!</li>
            <li> It is easy to dispense the small amount needed for application.</li>
            <li> A trip to my dermatologist doc costs me about $100, but this bottle is a very small fraction of that cost and gives me better results.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the peel I left it on for only about five minutes.</li>
            <li> red splotches, mainly on my cheekbones and around the corners of my nose.  </li>
            <li> This product is only for people with semi-normal to normal skin.</li>
            <li> and then when the time was done washed it off with cool water and dried my face well with a towel.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Then I rinsed it with cool water and applied a green tea and hyaluronic acid cream.</li>
            <li> After a few minutes I washed my face thoroughly with cool water.</li>
            <li> This facial peel when used properly can improve the look of fine lines, wrinkles, acne scars, age spots, and other skin discolorations.</li>
            <li> I had not heard about the baking soda mix to calm it down or deactivate the peel.  </li>
            <li> so you have a couple days to let your skin calm down before having to go to work or school.</li>
            <li> The product comes in a large blue and white box, and is wrapped in bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> It was a little harsher than this stuff, so I was more careful with it.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Definitely have a new smoothness to my skin.  </li>
            <li> So there really isn&#x27;t much to fear in using this product unless there is a contraindication, such as pregnancy, skin infections, open wounds, UV sensitive skin (Including those who are currently on a UV sensitizing medications,such as antibiotics), or extemely sensitive skin that you have not patch tested.</li>
            <li> You will notice dark burn marks tour first 2 to 3 days, but after 6-7 days they are completely gone.</li>
            <li> Also unlike green peel oils, you can still wash your skin with mild soaps and take a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon</li>
            <li> After the first day I noticed a visible difference in my sun spots on my upper cheeks and my tiny lines by my eyes are definitely diminished.  </li>
            <li> My face was a little red the next day, but it subsided and by the next day my skin was more even looking.</li>
            <li> First you do a patch test, if no irritation occurs then you can go ahead but do so carefully because face peels can burn!</li>
            <li> I have tested a few different items and I am never disappointed.</li>
            <li> how long you need the product on to make certain areas peel because all parts of your face are different in sensitivity and skin</li>
            <li> so your face has a chance to recover a little before entering civilization again, but really, that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> I had seen reviews of Lactic Acid peels in general stating that 1.</li>
            <li> The chemicals dissolve the bond between the old skin cells and the newer, younger cells beneath.</li>
            <li> I could barely stand the burning and stinging</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this peel twice so far</li>
            <li> Put a dab behind your ears and wait 48 hours to make sure that you aren&#x27;t allergic to any of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past 3 months as I wanted to wait a bit to see the true results before I review this product.</li>
            <li> Although my skin is Combination/Oily, I highly recommend it for any skin type, since it is very nourishing and will hydrate Dry skin as well.oo early to post photos, but perhaps I will revisit and post some down the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin peeled a few days later and my complexion looked more even with some slight fading of old acnescars.</li>
            <li> If you want results and are willing to experience a slight discomfort, this product is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> To my shock, my entire mouth and nose had done some major peeling overnight!</li>
            <li> Lastly, I saw no positive results; the only thing I received was a burn on my first use.</li>
            <li> It is extremely important to avoid the eye area, applying at least 1/2 inch away from the entire eye socket.</li>
            <li> It is extremely important to avoid the eye area, applying at least 1/2 inch away from the entire eye socket.</li>
            <li> after the first application I was not sure if it made any difference, but I&#x27;ve had 4 peels so far</li>
            <li> It was replaced with a much lighter spot, but much better than having the aging brown spot that was driving me crazy.  </li>
            <li> Remember, these are general guidelines, and everyone’s skin is different.</li>
            <li> and it has helped a lot including making a noticeable difference in the texture of my hands and getting rid of some dark spots from getting too much sun that  I had on my legs.</li>
            <li> The first application did remove dried patches and soften the area.</li>
            <li> Glycolic Peel is much stronger and a lot of women love it for its Anti-aging properties, but I find it too harsh and irritating.</li>
            <li> My skin is so much smoother, less oily and no dry patches.</li>
            <li> I left the product on until it felt a little hot and washed it off with a runny mixture of baking soda and water.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s happening with that, I am still using the product to see if it will improve with a few more uses with time.</li>
            <li> The first time, I applied it for 2 minutes, it caused my skin to sting, and it turned to red, but it only lasted for few hours.</li>
            <li> A little one page sheet with a disclaimer may prove to be very beneficial.</li>
            <li> I used a new flat, wide, paint brush from Michael’s.  </li>
            <li> You just put a little tiny bit on a cotton ball and apply it to your face and neck (avoiding the eyes and sensitive areas completely).</li>
            <li> It worked abit to clear some of the discolouration but not to the extend I expected, and I notice that since I&#x27;ve started using the peel  </li>
            <li> Lactic acid peels not only help regulate the pH of the skin, it removes impurities from the skin, cleansing the pores, removing dead cells, exfoliating skin, causing your skin to generate new cells faster.</li>
            <li> on to the directions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1: Cleanse the face, neck, and gently pat dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 2: Apply a small amount with a brush or cotton ball to the area and leave on as needed.</li>
            <li> but my skin was acting up, the breakouts most likely didn&#x27;t have anything to do with the product because my skin has been crazy since I  had my son.</li>
            <li> &gt; \\&quot;Also, please keep in mind, this is a promotional price and the price will go up, just letting you know, so that you are not surprised later.</li>
            <li> I have read different reports online with respect to how long it takes to see results, but I will keep plugging away every week.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any peeling.</li>
            <li> It is too early to post photos, but perhaps I will revisit and post some down the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really tried many peels, not because I was scared to, but because they&#x27;re so expensive.</li>
            <li> I also find that I&#x27;m not a big fan of waiting the few days to let my face naturally peel.  </li>
            <li> As someone who was totally apprehensive about using acids on skin, I&#x27;d read the all the reviews here atleast twice, adding to cart and deleting later multiple times before deciding to buy the 50% lactic acid gel peel for my dark underarms.</li>
            <li> Only negative thing is that it smells a bit funny, but since its only on your face for a few minutes its not a big deal!</li>
            <li> Next day my skin was very dry and flakey.</li>
            <li> yes i will definitely be spreading this around professional peel that works in less time for less money than a facial you got</li>
            <li> It minimized the appearance of my pores and it helped lighten the dark areas around my nose and mouth and it evened my skin tone in general.</li>
            <li> but my skin is not sensitive at all.</li>
            <li> Strange.</li>
            <li> and this was too long.</li>
            <li> You should avoid direct sun exposure few days after peeling.</li>
            <li> Now I just have the long wait until they grow out and see if the problem is taken care of.</li>
            <li> Our products are all of the highest pharmaceutical quality and we lose money on this offer, but we believe once you try our products, you will become a long term customer, so we can afford to sell at a loss\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I had to look on the Internet to see how people were using it because I would&#x27;ve had no idea how long to leave it on.</li>
            <li> so I had to look on the Internet to see how people were using it because I would&#x27;ve had no idea how long to leave it on.</li>
            <li> I was using this product for 4 times&lt;br /&gt;( 1/week), and had not much different as I expected.</li>
            <li> But I can tell it is sloughing off the dead skin cells as my skin looks fresher and my scars are nearly gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only given it a few tries so far, but I&#x27;m liking the results.</li>
            <li> I think once per week for one minute will slowly and gently take layers off</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t surprised when my skin got a little dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try this in between visits to medical spa to help speed things up and possibly spend less at the spa.</li>
            <li> My skin is rough, dry and oily at the same time.</li>
            <li> The wrinkles around my mouth are not as deep or noticeable (and this isn&#x27;t due to the swelling as was</li>
            <li> &quot; smell that was present in the other brand.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m going to say that the third time was NOT the charm due to the sunburned feeling on my face yesterday.</li>
            <li> After your time is up rinse your face with water and pat dry.</li>
            <li> I was really worried that I&#x27;d have serious redness or burns</li>
            <li> I dabbed my face dry</li>
            <li> All acids tend to leave the skin dry, I recommend a moisturizer after the peel.</li>
            <li> I wanted to intentionally dry out and burn off pimples; so this has worked wonders for my cause.</li>
            <li> My skin must be pretty tough to get through, so I decided to see if this product would work for me.  </li>
            <li> After second use my dark marks and skin discoloration is almost gone.</li>
            <li> The dark spots are the same.</li>
            <li> I’m still only at a minute and a half.  </li>
            <li> I want to try it on the upper lip where us ladies get those little lip wrinkles as well</li>
            <li> just about any facial imperfections that you need a little help with.</li>
            <li> And within 2 months *this bottle last for 2 months * it elimated all my dark spots!</li>
            <li> I might try it just a little longer next time but not much.</li>
            <li> Overall, I have had some slight redness and some peeling after using it but nothing extreme.</li>
            <li> So, be careful.</li>
            <li> Indeed, in that short time, the peel had removed all the flakes and dead skin.</li>
            <li> Indeed, in that short time, the peel had removed all the flakes and dead skin.</li>
            <li> could feel a bit of sting and my face was slightly pink for about a day.  </li>
            <li> I have seen results with just minimal side effects.&lt;br /&gt;Dr.</li>
            <li> A bit stronger than I expected</li>
            <li> I waited several days then used the peel again on my forehead and under my eyes, where I have a few wrinkles.</li>
            <li> The results were as expected....</li>
            <li> so be careful</li>
            <li> Follow the instructions that come with this product carefully.</li>
            <li> If I didn&#x27;t see it for myself I wouldn&#x27;t have believed it but dark spots on my legs that I have never able to get rid of unless the dermatologist uses a laser and or liquid nitrogen which leaves white spots, this vitamin C concoction has eradicated my leg freckles and my hands look much younger.</li>
            <li> I also noticed a few changes after my second peel.</li>
            <li> My face definitely needed something like this - something to &amp;#34;unglue&amp;#34; all the built-up dead skin.  </li>
            <li> I would have expected this if not for the reviews that mentioned none of this.</li>
            <li> The product arrived before I expected it.</li>
            <li> super.clears up ur face, minimal peeling</li>
            <li> I must have done it correctly the second time because it stung pretty bad and my skin started peeling about 4 days later.</li>
            <li> But after the first time, the cold sores did not come back</li>
            <li> In that short time it had removed about half the dead skin on the callus and my skin felt softer.</li>
            <li> In that short time it had removed about half the dead skin on the callus and my skin felt softer.</li>
            <li> It has a slightly thick clear liquid and it has an odd spicy smell that I sort of like.</li>
            <li> these were gentler than other chemical peels, 2.</li>
            <li> I think I may use it again in a few weeks, but I will never leave it on for so long.</li>
            <li> IMPROPER USE OF CHEMICAL PEELS CAN CAUSE SEVERE BURNS, PLEASE BE CAREFUL!</li>
            <li> I used it every other night.</li>
            <li> Dr. Song sends the peel instructions to your email when you order, but I wanted to see how other people reviewed this product and what their experiences were.</li>
            <li> I use this every night; a small amt mixed in my nighttime moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Lactic acid is milder than other acids</li>
            <li> This brand of serum is very expensive, but very worth the buy.</li>
            <li> I was really worried my sensitive skin would react badly or have a lot of pain.  </li>
            <li> and it still was active.  </li>
            <li> I was careful not to get the thin, viscous serum near my eyes or my nostrils.</li>
            <li> My face was a little pink</li>
            <li> As I washed my face, it itched and I rubbed it a little harder than I should.  </li>
            <li> IF your skin is really pink afterwards you might want to do it less often and or leave the peel on for less time.  </li>
            <li> I need in removing dark and embarrassing scars.</li>
            <li> The acid helps with acne scars, fading of dark circles, and even hyper-pigmentation.  </li>
            <li> cause its not readily absorbed.</li>
            <li> After cleansing your skin and drying it, you can apply the Dr. Song Lactic Acid to some dark or hyper pigmented spots on your face or all over.</li>
            <li> I tend to apply it to my dark spots to my face.</li>
            <li> None of the reviews here talk about using it for dark underarms</li>
            <li> I am already noticing that the dark spots are fading and my skin feels tighter.</li>
            <li> Song recommends the 50% Lactic Acid Face Peel be used slowly and only every 1-2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> ouch ladies be very very very careful when using this!</li>
            <li> and I guess essentially peel, subtly.</li>
            <li> i am black</li>
            <li> If you have an aversion to a warming or slight burning sensation, this product is not for you.</li>
            <li> I also have noticed a slight disappearance of acne scars.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t burn, didn&#x27;t hurt, just felt a slight tingling sensation until you washed the gel off.</li>
            <li> Using the eye dropper I applied a small amount to a cotton ball and carefully applied to my face.</li>
            <li> My skin&#x27;s dark spots are lightening little by little.</li>
            <li> Please follow the directions and go slow and test on a small area first.&lt;br /&gt;After the pinkish color left</li>
            <li> so well I thought I would leave it on a little bit longer when applying to the remainder of my face.  </li>
            <li> I am here to impart just a little knowledge about the terms before I get in on my review.</li>
            <li> Dark spots already lightening!</li>
            <li> Hence the four stars.where us ladies get those little lip wrinkles as well</li>
            <li> a little history about my skin</li>
            <li> My skin felt softer and smoother, and even looked a little brighter.    </li>
            <li> Nothing a little moisturizer couldn&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit of a burn but tolerable.</li>
            <li> Yes I continue to use, and yes its still somewhat painful and leaves my skin red and blotchy for a day, but after that its like I have a brand new face.</li>
            <li> True salon results without the hassle or crazy ridiculous prices.  </li>
            <li> I will change the review as time progresses, 37 year old female with bad genetics and suffering skin.</li>
            <li> Also, the first time I used it, it reactivated past cold sores.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to use cotton because I think it wastes the product.</li>
            <li> Peels are designed to remove flaky and dead skin.</li>
            <li> It simply removed a thin layer of the epidermis.  </li>
            <li> The one negative with this serum is that it comes with absolutely no directions</li>
            <li> The one negative with this serum is that it comes with absolutely no directions</li>
            <li> I have used this for approximately a week and it is definitely working.</li>
            <li> unfortunately my skin is extremely sensitive and i used it myself</li>
            <li> I washed and dried my face then put some on a cotton ball and smeared it on my face.</li>
            <li> I rubbed the product on my face evenly and let it sit for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I will go for round 3?</li>
            <li> I am glad that I did it because I had a very bad allergic reaction to this product.</li>
            <li> I look like I have a SLIGHT tan for a couple of days, and I see small flakes of skin on my &amp;#34;spinny&amp;#34</li>
            <li> A small bubble formed in one place, then it bled a little.</li>
            <li> First, its not that bad.</li>
            <li> So I went for it and it burns and stings pretty bad.</li>
            <li> Again just take it slowly and do it little by little.</li>
            <li> The result was like rubbing sand on a raw sunburn, but it did stop the burning (somewhat).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had very little stinging or burning, and my skin never peeled at all.  </li>
            <li> Again, I dropped a small amount to a cotton ball and applied it.</li>
            <li> Again, I dropped a small amount to a cotton ball and applied it.</li>
            <li> Always test on a small patch of skin before applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li> I usually will do my heels and then put socks over it</li>
            <li> and then once every two weeks for the past 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t usually have pimples before</li>
            <li> is so baby soft its almost crazy</li>
            <li> Received my peel with the usual Amazonian speed on 9/27 (mon).</li>
            <li> I did a small skin patch test.</li>
            <li> It will urge you to test products on small patches of skin before you lather it all over...</li>
            <li> I feel like crying I still can&#x27;t believe it!</li>
            <li> It is like the top layer of your skin is hiding all kinds of evil things</li>
            <li> I am not really sure.</li>
            <li> Second round, after a few days, brought out cold sores and not just around my nose and mouth.</li>
            <li> My face was a little red for about an hour, nothing too crazy.</li>
            <li> these things said, I am going to continue to use the product, but probably no more that in 2 minute intervals unless I know I&#x27;ll be home for the week-- maybe during Thanksgiving or Spring Break, but with kids, this is hard.  </li>
            <li> I thought maybe I just had a thick layer of dead cells to get rid of!</li>
            <li> My overall opinion on the product is I was very skeptical about using this product I was afraid of it burning my skin, I have some dark spots on my skin that I wanted to get rid of and by using this product I have noticed a little changes in the dark spots I had on my jawlines, under my neck and on my nose seem to be lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel like it&#x27;s hard to time</li>
            <li> the biggest complaint was the smell of the product.</li>
            <li> I washed off the peel with cold water and put ice on it for several hours.</li>
            <li> Some people complained about the smell.</li>
            <li> You must wait at least a week so don&#x27;t over do it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting at least a week between each peel because I want my skin to get used to it.</li>
            <li> I just neutralize with regular unscented bath soap before applying and neutralize again after applying it with cold water and a lot of soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been slowly seeing results.</li>
            <li> It is too thick or</li>
            <li> Since the Lactic Acid Gel is thick so it doesn’t run, it stays where I put it.  </li>
            <li> The peel is quite thick</li>
            <li> This peel removes the dead cells from the skin and cleans out your pores which improves the ability of the skin to absorb and retain moisture!!</li>
            <li> Just because it doesn&#x27;t cause an arm and a leg, doesn&#x27;t mean that this one doesn&#x27;t work...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the personality to look terrible around town with my face looking leathery and scaly for a few days while I agree to not disturb the peeling with my fingers (not to mention, using it harshly is more dangerous</li>
            <li> It was very small area, but because it was close to my eyes</li>
            <li> I noticed a slight burning and itching nothing too uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> as for my acne, i still break out but not as bad as before and as for my hyper-pigmentation, it got a tiny bit lighter.</li>
            <li> That is not a good approach.</li>
            <li> I would totally recommend ordering this if you want to get rid of some ugly freckles or sun spots.</li>
            <li> This is the third Dr. Song product I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve yet to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> A thin scab formed</li>
            <li> After sun tanning way too much had these terrible brown spots on my face.</li>
            <li> those check bone lines without irritating the eyes).  </li>
            <li> Made it thru the day at work and very anxious to see what else happens!</li>
            <li> extremely bad dark acne scars | pigmentation underneath my chin.</li>
            <li> It was a little tingly, nothing painful happened.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, there are no directions for use on the bottle itself.</li>
            <li> Not that expensive junk they sell at the Sephora or Ulta or on-line for triple the price.  </li>
            <li> with fake reviews..</li>
            <li> I received an email from the seller with instructions which seemed sketchy and cheesy.  </li>
            <li> or you will end up with burns sadly</li>
            <li> This product burns like crazy, i didnt see any change after applying.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, don&#x27;t be afraid to try this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, don&#x27;t be afraid to try this product.</li>
            <li> (avoid applying on areas that had cold sores).</li>
            <li> I just used cold water</li>
            <li> However, beware: if you are prone to cold sores... they will pop up all over your face.</li>
            <li> looks like the fake gel!</li>
            <li> &quot; (which btw was very vague)-</li>
            <li> Chemical peels were once reserved exclusively for the doctor&#x27;s office, and very expensive.</li>
            <li> I have had a bad reaction a time or two</li>
            <li> but nothing too bad.</li>
            <li> I still fight acne, but not as bad since I started using this product.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when I noticed that the acid peel burned my skin, but it wasn&#x27;t extremely painful.  </li>
            <li> So I had to death with my ugly skin for years.</li>
            <li> I lost :( .</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Updating my last raving review with one with pictures . I am one who hates looking at reviews and seeing pictures of the product .. We know what the bottle looks like lol I have not achieved &amp;#34;clear skin&amp;#34; YET , but this product is giving me the head start I need in removing dark and embarrassing scars. It&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; persay where your skin is falling off , but it&#x27;s does flake and I guess essentially peel, subtly. Which I honestly reccomend for anyone who doesn&#x27;t have an entire week to hide out in the house while you recover from what looks to be third degree burns with other &amp;#34;peels&amp;#34;. I look like I have a SLIGHT tan for a couple of days, and I see small flakes of skin on my &amp;#34;spinny&amp;#34; brush when I exfoliate. I reccomend a gentle exfoliant because you want it to heal the bottom layer of skin before scrubbing off the top layer .  Before and after 2 months of biweekly use . You be the judge . Happy shopping :)</li>
            <li> This product burns like crazy, i didnt see any change after applying. I did wait days after my skin is still the same. The product needs to have the instructions in the product package not just online.. That is not a good approach. Also include a tutorial video on the website :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;akreviews.com</li>
            <li> I have used it twice so far and it is definitely professional grade and seems to work quite well. Doesn&#x27;t come with any real applicator so you may want to buy a fan brush. I don&#x27;t want to use cotton because I think it wastes the product. Listen to instructions and don&#x27;t keep it on for more than 2 minutes. I have done the applications a week apart which is the minimum recommended but my skin is not sensitive at all.</li>
            <li> In the garbage. I don&#x27;t understand all the positive reviews here. I thought I&#x27;d try this in between visits to medical spa to help speed things up and possibly spend less at the spa. First, this is not a &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34;. There is no peeling. I like to see peeling - it makes me feel like something is happening. Second, this burns - a lot. Lastly, I saw no positive results; the only thing I received was a burn on my first use. This also came with no instructions. Strange. I was googling what to do. Then, 2-3 days after I received the product got a strange email that was more about ordering more than instructions on how to use.  I would rather spend 150+ 2-3x a year and get a professional peel. Just my opinion. If you can&#x27;t afford a real peel, try it I suppose. It&#x27;s cheap. If you can afford the real thing, skip this.</li>
            <li> This stuff is strong! So, be careful. Use it for spot treatments only and don&#x27;t use too much, i.e. follow the instructions on the package! I does work well though.</li>
            <li> I had not heard about the baking soda mix to calm it down or deactivate the peel.  I washed my face maybe 4 times and it still was active.  I could still feel it burning and my face peeled quite a bit.  I&#x27;ve had chemical peels.  I think it&#x27;s effective but you have to know how to stop the burn :-)</li>
            <li> Container: The product comes in a large blue and white box, and is wrapped in bubble wrap. Inside is a card noting that the detailed instructions on usage have been sent to the email associated with the Amazon account. I did not receive the directions, but went to the website to learn how to use the product. Also, inside the large box is the actual Gel Peel. It is a 1 fluid oz. glass bottle with an eye dropper cap. This protects the product from contamination and oxidation. It is easy to dispense the small amount needed for application. Unfortunately, there are no directions for use on the bottle itself. One recommendation would definitely be to have the instructions either in the large box (there is plenty of room), or on the bottle itself. While you can get the instructions for this specific peel from the Dr. Song website, and view numerous YouTube videos about Lactic Acid Peels, having them included with the product shows professionalism and could reduce possible inappropriate usage. There is a warning on the bottle to Use at your own risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: The listed ingredients are Lactic acid, purified water, sodium carboxyl-methylcellulose, propylene glycol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Product: Peels are designed to remove flaky and dead skin. The recommended time to leave on after application is 1 minute, gradually increasing the time as needed, with application occurring every 1-3 weeks. I had seen reviews of Lactic Acid peels in general stating that 1. these were gentler than other chemical peels, 2. it was easy and quick to do the peel, and 3. the biggest complaint was the smell of the product. I opened the product to take a sniff. While there was a chemical smell, it was not overpowering. It seemed to smell somewhat like burned fruit. It is very important to do a patch test, applying a small amount to skin to see if there is a reaction. I tested a tiny amount on my wrist with no after effects. Using the eye dropper I applied a small amount to a cotton ball and carefully applied to my face. It is extremely important to avoid the eye area, applying at least 1/2 inch away from the entire eye socket. The one dropper full was enough for my entire face. I waited 60 seconds and removed gently with soap and water. My skin immediately looked and felt smoother. It did not feel irritated and there was no stinging. Indeed, in that short time, the peel had removed all the flakes and dead skin. It was gentle, easy to apply, only used a small amount, and, best of all, it worked well. I decided to try to apply it to the callused area on the bottom of my foot. Again, I dropped a small amount to a cotton ball and applied it. I waited the 60 seconds and removed with soap and water. I was amazed! In that short time it had removed about half the dead skin on the callus and my skin felt softer. I anticipate that continued use will clear up that callus. While your results may vary, and taking all indicated precautions, I can recommend this product as gentle enough for facial skin, but strong enough for even calluses on your feet. My only recommendation is that Dr. Song Medicals include detailed instructions with each product. And it is important that you follow the instructions exactly. As it said &#x27;Use at your own risk&#x27;, but it might be just the thing to help your skin look and feel better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.carefully applied to my face.

            <li> This is the third Dr. Song product I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve yet to be disappointed. Their products are really intense and effective. This face peel is no exception. It&#x27;s super strong and produces a burning sensation when you&#x27;re using it. You can&#x27;t apply this more than once every week, but I use it even less than that. I will only use this about once per month going forward, if even that. I can only use this for one minute at a time because it&#x27;s the strongest peel I&#x27;ve ever used. You just put a little tiny bit on a cotton ball and apply it to your face and neck (avoiding the eyes and sensitive areas completely). Then leave it for 1 minute and rinse and wow, it really reveals new skin. It gets rid of any imperfections, but it&#x27;s very strong and not for sensitive skin. Again, this is very strong, so you should do a skin patch test first.&lt;br /&gt;This is great for wrinkles, hyperpigmentation, scars, and so many other things because it reveals new skin completely. The good thing is it takes 1 minute and produces huge, noticeable results, so it&#x27;s very quick gratification. You&#x27;ll want to use an intense moisturizer after this to reveal even softer, smoother skin. It also makes your skin brighter right after using it, kinda like it&#x27;s been illuminated from within. This is very affordable, considering how strong it is and how much you get. Dr. Song also offers a satisfaction guarantee.</li>
            <li> I was really scared to try this lactic acid face peel.  I was really worried my sensitive skin would react badly or have a lot of pain.  Boy, I was wrong and on top of no reaction I&#x27;ve had amazing results with just a couple uses.&lt;br /&gt;I have only used the 50% Lactic Acid 2 times.  The very first time I just tried it in one area for about 1 minute.  I used it on my check and could feel it working but didn&#x27;t have the burn I was worried about.&lt;br /&gt;The second time I used it, I applied it on my face and neck and left it on for 3 minutes.  I applied it with a cotton ball and then when the time was done washed it off with cool water and dried my face well with a towel.&lt;br /&gt;I could feel a bit of sting and my face was slightly pink for about a day.  After the first day I noticed a visible difference in my sun spots on my upper cheeks and my tiny lines by my eyes are definitely diminished.  I&#x27;m amazed, especially since I&#x27;m going light with it and I&#x27;ve really only used it once.  I have seen results with just minimal side effects.&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Song recommends the 50% Lactic Acid Face Peel be used slowly and only every 1-2 weeks.  No sooner than 7 days apart.  It&#x27;s also recommended to avoid direct sun exposure for 24 hours.  I also think a good sunscreen that we should be using anyways.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great idea that if you have a special event don&#x27;t use this product right before.  My face was a little pink and I wouldn&#x27;t have wanted to go out to a nice dinner or anything with it looking like that.  Please follow the directions and go slow and test on a small area first.&lt;br /&gt;After the pinkish color left, I felt I looked great.  My kids and husband noticed without me even saying a thing :) Love it!!!!!  True salon results without the hassle or crazy ridiculous prices.  I can&#x27;t wait to continue to use this face peel.  I&#x27;m one happy customer!!!!</li>
            <li> My first time with this type of peel and it burned quite a bit. Left on for 10 minutes and washed off. Moisturizer with night cream and went to sleep. Next day my skin was very dry and flakey. Moisturized again with Bag Balm and left on for 24 hours. Buffed off flakey skin the next day and ski was soft and better. A bit stronger than I expected so time will tell? I am 50 years old.</li>
            <li> My overall opinion on the product is I was very skeptical about using this product I was afraid of it burning my skin, I have some dark spots on my skin that I wanted to get rid of and by using this product I have noticed a little changes in the dark spots I had on my jawlines, under my neck and on my nose seem to be lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really feel that if you follow the directions that the product is pretty easy to use, I really like the product and am less afraid of using the product more and more. I really like this product and cant wait to see how much more my dark spots will get lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> this is the best ever!!!</li>
            <li> I only wish the directions came with it.  I did not get the e-mail with the directions for this item.  I had to look at old reviews so I could learn how to use this.  I am still hoping that I am using it right.  This dries out your skin so use a good face cream.</li>
            <li> I love peels and I admit I&#x27;m an exfoliation addict, so you bet I was thrilled when I was able to review Dr. Song&#x27;s Lactic Acid peel in 50%.  Before I go into the review, below is a little information on the acid and my non-professional steps when I do my own peels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is Latic Acid:&lt;br /&gt;You have heard of products containing &amp;#34;AHA&amp;#34;, well this is the product, alpha hydroxy acids.  Available in several percentages from a mild 20% to higher ones like 50% to 70%.  The acid is derived from milk and considered to be mild when it comes to irritations and used in &amp;#34;peel/mask&amp;#34; form by many, and especially first-time users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why use Lactic Acid:&lt;br /&gt;There are many benefits in a peel of this form because it provides a deeper exfoliation.  Great for resurfacing of the skin, cleaning out debris from pores and especially beneficial for mature/aging skin.  The acid helps with acne scars, fading of dark circles, and even hyper-pigmentation.  You get skin that is smoother, younger looking, and firmer in tone.  Great for fading finer lines and improving overall the look of your skin.  You will notice improvements in tone and even a glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Song&#x27;s Lactic Acid comes in gel form and I find that beneficial, as you don&#x27;t want to be chasing the acid around when applying.  I first did a &amp;#34;spot test&amp;#34;  and after 45 seconds, I felt that was my good start point.  I let a day lapse to make sure my spot did not have a negative reaction.  I applied with a cotton ball all over my face, avoiding the sensitive areas like my eyes, lips, and nostrils.  Set the timer and I then used a mild facial wash to deactivate the acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients (as listed on the site):&lt;br /&gt;Lactic acid, purfied water, sodium carboxylmethylcellulose, propylene glycol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results:&lt;br /&gt;My first peel let me know I can increase the time to one minute and I did just that and started seeing results with my second peel, which were more noticeable.  Dr. Song&#x27;s Lactic Acid peel provided the deep exfoliation in a milder way for me.  I could never get these results with my facial brush and sometimes I tend to over focus in one area and cause irritation.  This was a simple peel that does all the work, all treated areas at one time, and you just wash it off.  Like with any acid peel, as long as you read the directions and follow them carefully, you should be happy with the results.  My only con is that the directions are not included with the product and are e-mailed, also available on their website.  You could accidentally delete an e-mail, so I suggest printing them and sticking them in the box with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the above product(s) free of charge from Dr. Song.

            <li> I was very impressed with how smooth my skin was after I used this chemical peel. I think there should be directions that come with this peel, especially being that it is so strong. I read many comments before I purchased and not many people had complaints. The first time I used the peel I left it on for only about five minutes. It tingled and burned some. I washed it off and noticed how smooth my skin felt. My face was a little red the next day, but it subsided and by the next day my skin was more even looking. I waited several days then used the peel again on my forehead and under my eyes, where I have a few wrinkles. I left it on longer this time 12-15 minutes and this was too long. It burned the skin near my eye. A small bubble formed in one place, then it bled a little. It was very small area, but because it was close to my eyes I was very scared I permanently damaged my skin and my eyes. I washed off the peel with cold water and put ice on it for several hours. I put ice on it the next day also, but by the next day it started looking better. Within four days the skin healed and the top layer peeled off. It has been a week now and my skin looks better and feels smooth. I think I may use it again in a few weeks, but I will never leave it on for so long. This is a very strong peel that works amazingly, it needs to come with directions though. A little one page sheet with a disclaimer may prove to be very beneficial.</li>
            <li> this acid gel peel works wonders</li>
            <li> Works fantastic! Very pleased with immediate results.</li>
            <li> Let it be known that this stuff POTENT! As soon as I put it on my face it started to burn intensely and I had to immediately rinse it off. However, the results were great. Also the instructions never came by email like the package said they would be. Why not just include the instructions with the package? I ended up finding them in the customer reviews.</li>
            <li> This peel is definitely professional grade!  As I&#x27;ve just started my journey focusing on my skin care ~ (my crinkles are starting to show)...I love being able to use a professional product at home.  I knew Dr Song was a reputable brand in the teeth whitening department, and I&#x27;m so glad they have expanded into skin care.&lt;br /&gt;You can read my in depth review on my blog:  http://treatsbytanya.com/?p&#x3D;833</li>
            <li> I was very excited when I received this peel for review. I tried lactic acid peels before, but I was not 100% satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;So far, I used Dr Song peel twice, and I am already satisfied. The first time, I applied it for 2 minutes, it caused my skin to sting, and it turned to red, but it only lasted for few hours. Then I rinsed it with cool water and applied a green tea and hyaluronic acid cream. I applied it at night, to give my skin time to cool down while sleeping. The next time was 10 days later. After which, I noticed that my skin is luminous, more even skin tone, and pigmentation started to fade away.&lt;br /&gt;You should remember that it takes 1-2 weeks for your skin to regenerate new skin and the results to achieve. In addition, because lactic acid peels can cause skin to become very sensitive to sun light, winter is the perfect time to try them out. You should avoid direct sun exposure few days after peeling.</li>
            <li> Finally a product that works! If have ever paid over $100 for a similar peel at an beauty salon...you no longer have to. This is the real deal. Not that expensive junk they sell at the Sephora or Ulta or on-line for triple the price.  It is strong so follow the directions Dr. Song provides - no longer than one minute...or less.  You may want to start with a lower concentration if  your skin is sensitive.  You are guaranteed bright, clearer, tighter skin after just one application. It is also fading sun spots.  Some people complained about the smell. First, its not that bad. Second, who cares if the product actually works. Third, as soon as you wipe/rinse your face the smell doesn&#x27;t linger.  All that junk they sell in salons and stores, smells nice but doesn&#x27;t work.  I&#x27;ll go with an affordable product that actually works every time. I am so in love with Dr. Song products, including the Vitamin C/Hyralounic Acid serum.  Now if only they would create a product with Retinol/Retinoids, they would have a perfect trifecta of skin products.  I&#x27;ve used this product over three months and it keeps delivering results.  This product will continue to be part of my skin care regimine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been slowly seeing results. But it makes my face incredibly soft</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend reading the instructions - AND adhering to them prior to using this.  I did a test spot the night before for about 90 seconds, and since that worked so well I thought I would leave it on a little bit longer when applying to the remainder of my face.  The tingling started almost immediately, but I pushed through leaving it on for a total of 5 minutes.  The results were as expected.... red splotches, mainly on my cheekbones and around the corners of my nose.  It took about a full week for these to go away, and now that my skin has had time to rest the results are FANTASTIC!!  My skin is so smooth and yes some of the dark spots are gone in just one application.  The wrinkles around my mouth are not as deep or noticeable (and this isn&#x27;t due to the swelling as was when I first applied).&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely do another application but will wait a couple more weeks and not leave on more than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> My skin burned much , I could not use the product.</li>
            <li> I know some people get scared off by the main ingredient, named &amp;#34;Lactic Acid&amp;#34; and then on top of that it follows with &amp;#34;Face Peel&amp;#34;. I am here to impart just a little knowledge about the terms before I get in on my review. Lactic acid is derived from Milk and is very gentle. You should also know how a chemical peel works is similar to a good exfoliation or microdermabrasion, except that it is not a physical sloughing of the top dead layer of skin cells. The chemicals dissolve the bond between the old skin cells and the newer, younger cells beneath. So while the terms can sound frightful,it really isn&#x27;t all that harsh of a treatment, especially considering that you can buy this over the counter. You can get stronger peels done at the spa, and only the strongest ones done by your Dermatologist. So there really isn&#x27;t much to fear in using this product unless there is a contraindication, such as pregnancy, skin infections, open wounds, UV sensitive skin (Including those who are currently on a UV sensitizing medications,such as antibiotics), or extemely sensitive skin that you have not patch tested. ALWAYS PATCH TEST. Even if you have used it before. Put a dab behind your ears and wait 48 hours to make sure that you aren&#x27;t allergic to any of the ingredients. Then you should be good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I really like this Lactic Peel, because it is gentle enough to use at home, yet still effective at helping increase cell turnover to reveal visible improvements in my skin. Glycolic Peel is much stronger and a lot of women love it for its Anti-aging properties, but I find it too harsh and irritating. Lactic is great for my skin type, which is combination, yet hormonal and acne prone at my jawline. I&#x27;ve been able to use this product twice in the last month, since I am also still doing Professional treatments at the spa where I work. I am using this in conjunction with Laser Genesis to treat my acne and the combination is starting to work well. It is too early to post photos, but perhaps I will revisit and post some down the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, don&#x27;t be afraid to try this product. It is gentle and effective for at home use. Nothing replaces a professional treatment, but doing your part at home really helps your Esthetician or Dermatologist. It&#x27;s like brushing your teeth in between Dental Cleanings. Don&#x27;t wait for us to treat your skin. Your involvement and at home care is essential to over all epidermal/dermal health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a great start. Although my skin is Combination/Oily, I highly recommend it for any skin type, since it is very nourishing and will hydrate Dry skin as well.oo early to post photos, but perhaps I will revisit and post some down the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, don&#x27;t be afraid to try this product.

            <li> My face has improved so much, I have less wrinkles, and I don&#x27;t even break out as much! This is great product!</li>
            <li> Works well and is more gentle as a gel rather than lactic acid!  Enjoying using.</li>
            <li> looks like the fake gel! with fake reviews..</li>
            <li> Review of the product apart - I got voucher  with the product to take a short survey promising a gift card for Dr.Song products. I took the survey and bam there is no response or any gift card they promised !!!&lt;br /&gt;Are they listening?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product wise - It&#x27;s too early for me to say anything as I have used peels before and they take time to show the results.</li>
            <li> I love all Dr. Song products.  This is another great product!</li>
            <li> Very good product.  Works better than glycolic acid.  It&#x27;s very strong so be careful or else you will burn yourself.  The burn marks appear a day or so later.  Also, the first time I used it, it reactivated past cold sores.  Most chemical peel products clearly caution you about this.  But after the first time, the cold sores did not come back (avoid applying on areas that had cold sores).</li>
            <li> GREAT PEEL FOR PEOPLE WHO LOVE TRYING PEELS</li>
            <li> This lactic acid peel is awesome. I am used to using peels and I know that some can be weak sometimes, but Dr. Song&#x27;s peel is definitely one of the best i&#x27;ve ordered on amazon. I promised my skin was glowing the next day. Its strong so follow the directions carefully. I can&#x27;t wait until I can do my next peel. You must wait at least a week so don&#x27;t over do it. I will be recommending this peel to friends and I will reorder in the future.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best product for the price. All of my freckles are gone thanks to Dr. Song&#x27;s solution. I would totally recommend ordering this if you want to get rid of some ugly freckles or sun spots. Best deal too!</li>
            <li> Great product. After first use large dark marks have diminished. After second use my dark marks and skin discoloration is almost gone. Follow the instructions that come with this product carefully.</li>
            <li> This will review will be ongoing...  I tried a similar product from another manufacture with 15% acidity.  A good friend recommended it, but it didn&#x27;t do much for me.  My skin must be pretty tough to get through, so I decided to see if this product would work for me.  04/24/2005 - Applied Solution to a small part of right cheek that had an aging brown-spot 10 mm in length for something like 15 minutes or more.  As I washed my face, it itched and I rubbed it a little harder than I should.  That&#x27;s when I noticed that the acid peel burned my skin, but it wasn&#x27;t extremely painful.  It simply removed a thin layer of the epidermis.  I washed it thoroughly with water to remove any of the remaining acid and then applied tripple-antibiotic for about a week to prevent infection.  A thin scab formed and I stopped using the product.  05/04/2005 - I took a moment to look at the mirror and noticed that my brown spot was gone.  Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s permanent, but it&#x27;s not there any more.  It was replaced with a much lighter spot, but much better than having the aging brown spot that was driving me crazy.  05/26/2005 - I decided to apply the acid once again on my skin, this time I tried it on the right cheek again, this time only for 6 minutes, and then the right cheek for 8 minutes.  After I washed it with water, I placed triple-antibiotic on both cheeks.  My face didn&#x27;t burn this time, it&#x27;s just tingling.  I&#x27;m going to wait until 05/11/2005 and I will report the results.</li>
            <li> The product does cause peeling.  It is a gel.  The dropper that comes with it doesn&#x27;t do a very good job of getting the gel out of the bottle.  It is too thick or the dropper just doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> Found this product to meet all my expectations! Got rid of those wrinkles that are popping up on face and neck. Even worked on the chest wrinkles! My skin looks clearer too from all the years of sun damage from being a young sun worshiper. Very strong, so  be careful and follow directions. Will surely buy again in the near future.</li>
            <li> I applied this to my tonails that have a fungus using a Q tip and let it sit for about 30-45 minutes.  I did this for about a week.  A couple weeks later the nails pretty much peeled off and, that alone is an improvement.  Now I just have the long wait until they grow out and see if the problem is taken care of.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment and I can&#x27;t wait to try it out! Heard great things about this product. I will be using it to maintain healthy skin in helping to get rid of dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> So I received an email with instructions on how to use a peel i ordered and included with the message was this :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; \\&quot;Also, please keep in mind, this is a promotional price and the price will go up, just letting you know, so that you are not surprised later. Our products are all of the highest pharmaceutical quality and we lose money on this offer, but we believe once you try our products, you will become a long term customer, so we can afford to sell at a loss\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;..UPDATE:THE COMPANY EMAILED ME BACK AND THEY SAID THEY DO NOT AUTOMATICVALLY BILL YOUR CARD MONTHY. (which is good- but the price will go up on my next order).&lt;br /&gt; I do feel they should give you better, more thorough instructions on the products. I received an email with instructions on \\&quot;the peel I purchased\\&quot; (which btw was very vague)- but I purchased 3 different peels. I&#x27;m unsure which one this is even regarding. I feel there should be detailed instructions with every individual peel- they DO all work differently and they are very strong and can do damage without knowing what to do specifically. I also purchased the teeth whitening system- which I never received instruction on- I am clueless as to how to use that. I tried to find a website - but couldn&#x27;t find too much??</li>
            <li> I ordered the Dr. Song 50% Lactic Acid peel because of the low price, although, it is my understanding that was just an introductory price and it will go up.  I just hope the price does not rise so much it becomes too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did try the product and I like the fact it is a thicker gel type consistency so it doesn&#x27;t run like some of the watery facial peels can have a tendency to do.  I have only tried it once, though, so don&#x27;t know what the long-term results will yield and that is why I gave it &amp;#34;4&amp;#34; stars instead of five.  -RK</li>
            <li> I have used another brand and it was good, but this brand is AWESOME !!!!&lt;br /&gt;I was up to minutes with the one I was using, I could only do 1 minute.</li>
            <li> Great peel.  I&#x27;ve only used this 3 times and I&#x27;m already noticing a difference as my skin is super smooth.  It beats going to the spa and shelling out hundreds of dollars.</li>
            <li> Great price. Skin look measurably better after one week.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent value, and high quality. I also like how glass is used instead of plastic. I&#x27;d like to try the salicylic acid peel next.</li>
            <li> This is by far the most professional peel I have ever had! BONUS I did it myself and in my own bathroom!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this is a professional Lactic Acid Gel Peel it’s strong! The directions say you have to work up to the full-time. No kidding! My first peel I didn’t even make it a full minute before I had to rinse my face!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIRST and foremost! DO a Skin Patch Test FIRST!!!  IMPROPER USE OF CHEMICAL PEELS CAN CAUSE SEVERE BURNS, PLEASE BE CAREFUL! Always test on a small patch of skin before applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next warning!! Sunburn Alert: Peels can increase your skin’s sensitivity to the sun and particularly the possibility of sunburn. Use a sunscreen, wear protective clothing, and limit sun exposure while using this product and for a week afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to the directions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1: Cleanse the face, neck, and gently pat dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 2: Apply a small amount with a brush or cotton ball to the area and leave on as needed. I found the brush works best. I used a new flat, wide, paint brush from Michael’s.  It works perfectly. Since I’m trying to rid my hands of age spots I use an eye dropper amount on the back of my hand and dip my brush into the Dr.Song Lactic Acid from there. This is working great for me!! Since the Lactic Acid Gel is thick so it doesn’t run, it stays where I put it.  I LOVE this stuff!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leave the peel on your face for 1 to 2 minutes.  But work up gradually. After your time is up rinse your face with water and pat dry. I do my peel before my shower in the evenings. So I rinse in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You only need to do a peel every 7 days. IF your skin is really pink afterwards you might want to do it less often and or leave the peel on for less time.  Remember, these are general guidelines, and everyone’s skin is different. Peel times vary from person to person. I lasted less than a minute my first time, you may go the full minute. I’m still only at a minute and a half.  You decide which is best for you!! It can only be learned through experience and patience!!  It’s also another reason to do a skin patch tests!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRECAUTIONS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to keep the peel at least a quarter of an inch away from the eyes and mucus membranes.&lt;br /&gt;If skin irritation occurs remove the product by neutralizing with cool water immediately and consult a physician.&lt;br /&gt;Do not apply the peel more than once in a 7 day period&lt;br /&gt;Do not expose your face to the sun for 24 hours before or after the application of the peel. YOU WILL BURN!!! Which in turns means more age spots!! TRUST ME!!&lt;br /&gt;Do not apply the peel to the skin that has been waxed or shaved within 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;When using the peel a stinging sensation may occur, this is normal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE, LOVE, LOVE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve heard Dr Oz tout the benefits of lactic peels to help lighten skin and eliminate scars. Y’all know me! It’s a never-ending battle to rid myself of age spots!! I have to say Dr. OZ was right!! I HAVE found the PERFECT PEEL!!!  This is absolutely perfect!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lactic acid is an alpha hydroxy acid that is mild and suitable even for sensitive skin. Lactic acid peels not only help regulate the pH of the skin, it removes impurities from the skin, cleansing the pores, removing dead cells, exfoliating skin, causing your skin to generate new cells faster. New cells means the signs of aging, wrinkles, crow’s feet, fine lines and dark patches, disappear, and give your skin a youthful AMAZING glow!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The morning after I use my Dr. Song Lactic Acid Peel I wake up with the rosiest cheeks, looking so refreshed!! I love the way my skin feels after I use my peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BONUS! This peel removes the dead cells from the skin and cleans out your pores which improves the ability of the skin to absorb and retain moisture!! Over time your pores become clogged and you need something stronger than a facial cleaner to clean out those pores. Dr. Song does exactlythat!! It’s like starting with a clean canvas!! You’ll find that your beauty creams and serums will work better when you add Dr Song to your beauty routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MORE TO LOVE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes With 365 Day 100% No Hassle Money Back Guarantee!!!

            <li> Received item quickly and instructions were easy to follow. Dark spots already lightening! Will be trying ALL of Dr. Song&#x27;s products!</li>
            <li> The product is amazing!! I used it every other night. I peeled nicely. My skin is more even and supple. I definitely recommend it. I am also supper please with delivery and costumer care. Keep up the fantastic work!</li>
            <li> This product works as a gentle peel.  I use it on my knees and my heels and sure enough about 1-2 weeks later that area is peeling.  It is kind of weird because it is a gel it just sits on top of your skin.  I usually will do my heels and then put socks over it cause its not readily absorbed.</li>
            <li> I got this when it first came out as an introductory price on Amazon, I believe it was 6.99 a bottle. So I bought two bottles many months ago and put them away and just never got around to using them. I decided to start using the serum because I&#x27;m starting to pay more attention to my hands and I&#x27;m making it a priority because your hands always tell your age, I see people that look fairly young but they have age spots on their hands and it just really looks unattractive and shows their age. I never understand why celebrities that are older but still look really good have age spots on their hands. Prior to this and I will continue to do this in conjunction with Dr. Song&#x27;s, I&#x27;ve been using vitamin C serum and a vitamin C/retinol/tea tree oil serum that I got on Amazon as well and it has helped a lot including making a noticeable difference in the texture of my hands and getting rid of some dark spots from getting too much sun that  I had on my legs. If I didn&#x27;t see it for myself I wouldn&#x27;t have believed it but dark spots on my legs that I have never able to get rid of unless the dermatologist uses a laser and or liquid nitrogen which leaves white spots, this vitamin C concoction has eradicated my leg freckles and my hands look much younger. I want to really get the top layer of sun damaged skin off of my hands and keep this up so I don&#x27;t develop any brown spots on my hands, also most importantly, I use Khiel&#x27;s 50 SPF facial sunscreen on the top of my hands always, luckily I don&#x27;t have any spots yet but I&#x27;m doing this as prevention. That being said I can&#x27;t really say what the results are yet because I&#x27;ve only used it once however, this review is to let everyone know that I left it on the top of both my hands for five minutes, I did not burn at all, then I washed it off. I would&#x27;ve liked to of left it on longer but it was a test so the next time I&#x27;ll go to 10 minutes + and see what happens but there was no burning, it was very tolerable. I want to try it on the upper lip where us ladies get those little lip wrinkles as well so  I will update my review later. The one negative with this serum is that it comes with absolutely no directions so I had to look on the Internet to see how people were using it because I would&#x27;ve had no idea how long to leave it on. Hence the four stars.where us ladies get those little lip wrinkles as well so  I will update my review later.

            <li> Pretty good for the price, I tried a more expensive brand; #1 Best Seller on Amazon for $34.00 and this worked just as good. It doesn&#x27;t have the \\&quot;Medical Tea Tree Acidity\\&quot; smell that was present in the other brand. I was able to order 3 bottles of Dr. Song vs 1 bottle of the former product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Dr Song</li>
            <li> After sun tanning way too much had these terrible brown spots on my face. Been using for like 3 weeks, 2 times a week and can see a significant difference.</li>
            <li> I was sent a bottle of Dr. Song  50% Lactic Acid to try on my skin and do a review on. So what does this product promise to do? This product is a type of chemical peel made from Lactic Acid. This facial peel when used properly can improve the look of fine lines, wrinkles, acne scars, age spots, and other skin discolorations. I love that Dr Song Medical products are made in the USA and is FDA compliant and a provider of professional products that focus on natural ingredients. By the way I am battling Acne Scars, so this is the main reason I wanted to review this product. Chemical peels were once reserved exclusively for the doctor&#x27;s office, and very expensive. Today, chemical peels have evolved to include take-home peels and kits, allowing you to reap their benefits in the privacy of your own home.</li>
            <li> A trip to my dermatologist doc costs me about $100, but this bottle is a very small fraction of that cost and gives me better results. I was a little suspicious at first, but I took my time to get used to applying the peel myself and now my peels are basically free since the bottle lasts for quite some time for multiple peels.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> too strong for me...gotta go back to 30 percent</li>
            <li> i got this a couple of weeks ago... it shipped fast - which is really great. i have not used a skin peel before so naturally i was scared to use one.&lt;br /&gt;so a little history about my skin, i am in my mid twenties and i have suffered from severe acne for 3 years now. i am black so i have unsightly hyper-pigmentation allover my face. i bought this because i read some great reviews about it. first off, the price was affordable and i also read that lactic acid doesn&#x27;t actually peel off your skin so that was comforting. i have tried it twice now for about 3 - 4 minutes each time and i felt a stinging sensation which is normal from what i read. this peel will make your skin look and feel tighter. as for my acne, i still break out but not as bad as before and as for my hyper-pigmentation, it got a tiny bit lighter. i think i will see what the future weeks have to bring because patience on my part is always required with this battle of acne and aftermath. i would recommend this product to anyone looking to do a lactic acid peel</li>
            <li> Each bottle contains approx. 15-20 full facial peels (30 nl/ 1 oz)&lt;br /&gt;Comes with 365 Day&lt;br /&gt;100% No Hassle Money Back Guarantee&lt;br /&gt;You can return the item even if its empty.&lt;br /&gt;Made with Pharmaceutical Grade Lactic Acid&lt;br /&gt;Guaranteed Quality&lt;br /&gt;Made in USA&lt;br /&gt;Manufactured in an FDA compliant cosmetic laboratory&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Lactic Acid, Purified Water, sodium carboxylmethylcellulose, propylene glycol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: Use at your own risk (For external use only). If irritation becomes severe, discontinue use) Keep out of reach of children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This facial peel, you should only use once a week. It is great for hyper-pigmentations and dark spots. The serum doesn&#x27;t peel your skin but removes impurities from the skin. It leaves a very smooth to the touch face. The serum has a very sticky feel to it and quite a stronger scent than I am use to. This brand of serum is very expensive, but very worth the buy. This bottle contains enough liquid for 15-20 full facial peels. Make sure to wash your face before and after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to test this out on your hand before applying to your face. Don&#x27;t use more than a few drops of this product on your face. This product is only for people with semi-normal to normal skin. If you are unsure about if you may or may not be allergic to this item, please consult your dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a very professional product to use, if you are an individual that wants a salon/spa type product that you can use at home.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different Lactic Acid Peels in my days and, personally, I love them. I have had a bad reaction a time or two and I know the reason why...cheap products. This particular peel is Fantastic! Just because it doesn&#x27;t cause an arm and a leg, doesn&#x27;t mean that this one doesn&#x27;t work...cause Dr.Song products could be priced a LOT higher due to their amazing ability to fulfil their promises. The packaging was very sturdy and the bottle is made of high quality materials. My face looks brighter, smoother, and cleaner overall. You won&#x27;t regret this purchase! As with all, or most, new products, just remember to test a small spot on your inner arm before using the product. Thx Dr. Song!</li>
            <li> My skins best friend! I use this about twice a week with my regular acne treatment. I am noticing a decline in redness and those pesky bumps on my chin have disappeared! I recommend this to everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I was sent this item for review, but all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I love that this product now comes in dropper form, which makes measuring and dispensing the product much easier!  It almost has a very slight &#x27;brown sugar&#x27; type odor (which I love), and the gel like consistency makes it easy to apply to the face.  I use it before bedtime, and wake up to even skin tone, a glowing complexion, and very soft skin. I have used most all of the products that Dr Song sells- very good products and affordable too!</li>
            <li> I love the Dr. Song product line. I have tested a few different items and I am never disappointed. This peel works great on me to remove dead and dull skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it for a little less time than suggested, because my skin is sensitive, but I still get great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been very happy with every use that I have done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for providing a sample of this product for review on my blog.</li>
            <li> Make sure to do the skin test. I am glad that I did it because I had a very bad allergic reaction to this product.</li>
            <li> well my skin is definitely peeling</li>
            <li> I like it. Its not a dramatic change, but it does strech your sking nicely and pumps it up a bit afterwards.  Theres no peeling,  which is good. I dont want to have a snake effect on my face at all. You can even wear make up if you have to after you just had it done. I used  the vitamin C serum  right after. Its very mild, I left it on for almost 5 min, but every skin is different. I have tolerance already.</li>
            <li> They sent me glycoluc acid by mistake, so I don&#x27;t really know how to rate this, but I thought the glycoluc acid was wonderful. Very nice quality and thickness to it.</li>
            <li> This product was my first foray into self-peeling.  I was hesitant to try this one since it was a new brand.  But I&#x27;m happy to report that it works well and has already lightened a large, ugly brown spot on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is pretty strong so if you have sensitive skin, I would start with something weaker.  Lactic acid peels are good for hyperpigmentation and age/sun spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside was that it didn&#x27;t come with good instructions.  I received an email from the seller with instructions which seemed sketchy and cheesy.  I used the Googles to get better instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I highly recommend are to really really stay out of the sun after a peel, slather good moisturizer on your face (don&#x27;t skimp), and try not to wash your face for a day or two (after neutralizing the acid).  It sounds gross but it&#x27;ll help prevent scarring.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past 3 months as I wanted to wait a bit to see the true results before I review this product. So here it is...I started using the product to do peels once a week for 7 weeks and then once every two weeks for the past 4 weeks. It worked abit to clear some of the discolouration but not to the extend I expected, and I notice that since I&#x27;ve started using the peel  my skin is breaking out abit and I don&#x27;t usually have pimples before so I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s happening with that, I am still using the product to see if it will improve with a few more uses with time. So will update you with the results as time goes along.</li>
            <li> I received 2 bottles and have only used one of them 3 times since I got them, around April I believe. I have not noticed any changes probably because I only used them 3 times. I left the product on until it felt a little hot and washed it off with a runny mixture of baking soda and water. I planned to keep using them more often but my skin was acting up, the breakouts most likely didn&#x27;t have anything to do with the product because my skin has been crazy since I  had my son. My skin is already soft but after each use my skin felt like my sons cheeks :) only noticeable change. My face is still really soft. I will begin using it again once winter hits this year, and I will update my review.</li>
            <li> Dr song was great. I made a mistake when placing my order, and he fixed it straight away. Product arrived quickly and as described. I&#x27;ve only given it a few tries so far, but I&#x27;m liking the results. Only negative thing is that it smells a bit funny, but since its only on your face for a few minutes its not a big deal!</li>
            <li> This product arrived right on time and in good condition. I have only used it twice and can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve seen remarkable results yet. I&#x27;m continuing to use it and hopefully will have some positive results after several more uses.</li>
            <li> Great product for when you lack the time (&amp; the money) to go have a professional peel.  I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really tried many peels, not because I was scared to, but because they&#x27;re so expensive. I refuse to pay to get a peel professionally because its highway robbery, but at the same time I haven&#x27;t found many products that are budget friendly that I TRUST. I&#x27;ve recently discovered Dr. Song products and I&#x27;ve fallen in love with them. It just made sense to me to try their gel peel because they make high quality products that I can depend on.    I scoured reviews before I tried it. I wanted to see what everyone else had to say and what their results were. I didn&#x27;t want to make any mistakes! Dr. Song sends the peel instructions to your email when you order, but I wanted to see how other people reviewed this product and what their experiences were. I found mixed reviews that both impressed and terrified me.    This lactic acid peel comes in a frosted glass bottle with a dropper built into the lid for dispensing. It has the classic shiny silver Dr. Song label. It looks very classy and high quality. The gel is clear and odorless, so there isn&#x27;t any perfumes or dyes to irritate your skin or senses.    The first time I tried it, I applied it with a cotton ball and left it on for one minute, and then rinsed with water. I had very little stinging or burning, and my skin never peeled at all.  The second time, I used a cosmetic pad and left it on for one minute again. I must have done it correctly the second time because it stung pretty bad and my skin started peeling about 4 days later. I also noticed a few changes after my second peel. My skin felt softer and smoother, and even looked a little brighter.    My third time I used a cosmetic pad to apply it, and I left it on for 3 minutes. I could barely stand the burning and stinging so when the 3 minutes were up, I quickly rinsed it off with water. I was really worried that I&#x27;d have serious redness or burns but I didn&#x27;t. My skin peeled a few days later and my complexion looked more even with some slight fading of old acnescars. I&#x27;ve been waiting at least a week between each peel because I want my skin to get used to it. I might eventually switch to 2 or 3 minutes twice a week and see what that does for me.    Overall, I have had some slight redness and some peeling after using it but nothing extreme. I&#x27;ve had the benefits of smoother, brighter skin, a more even skin tone, and some fading of old acne scars. As long as you follow the directions and use common sense, this is a wonderful peel. I would recommend it to anyone that doesn&#x27;t have super sensitive skin. If you DO have really sensitive skin, you might want to try a peel with a lower percentage of lactic acid (20% lactic acid or lower) until you know how your skin will react.    This product was provided to me for testing and review purposes, but I would never endorse something that I didn&#x27;t believe was worthy of it and I would never post an opinion that wasn&#x27;t my own.</li>
            <li> I have freckles since I was born, mainly on both cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;I tried other AHA skin peel products before,usually have significant changes&lt;br /&gt;after first time or second time. I was using this product for 4 times&lt;br /&gt;( 1/week), and had not much different as I expected.</li>
            <li> There is great customer service and this product is very reasonably priced and a good product/peel. I do recommend this.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. It is very strong so be cautious using it on the first try. However it  works like a charm!!</li>
            <li> The real deal. Read the directions first...but this product is great!</li>
            <li> Does not come with directions.  70% Glycolic  is a better option and use by dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this peel twice now and it&#x27;s amazing. The first time I saw a huge improvement in texture, and brightness and the second peel slightly burned my face and was red for a day but looked great the next day. I will probably wait a few more days between applications the next go. I left it on 1-3 minutes both times. It has cleared all blemishes and blackheads.</li>
            <li> Just a basic peel, just like the others.</li>
            <li> Great product arrived quickly and seems to be the real deal. My skin is looking better everyday. I have used this for approximately a week and it is definitely working. Would recommend this to anyone who wants better looking skin</li>
            <li> I will change the review as time progresses, 37 year old female with bad genetics and suffering skin. I&#x27;ve done chemical peels &amp; lasers at the doctors office. I&#x27;m happy to have something effective for home. I did it once. I did not test. I just went for it. I lasted about a minute and rinsed off in cool water and then moisturized and went to sleep. The following day when I was applying my face for the day I was STUNNED at how supple my face looked on the mirror and then I touched it and was equally as impressed. I&#x27;m already satisfied with my purchase!  It&#x27;s been over a year since my last chemical peel however my face is used to this kind of thing and I STILL only did a minute and sat in front of the fan. It was definitely stinging immediately. When I washed it off it stopped. The next day I saw and felt nothing but good things- like I said supple and seemingly well hydrated! Use with caution and see incredible results. I can&#x27;t not wait to see how much better my skin gets with time without having to go to the Dr, spend the  big bucks or suffer down time.</li>
            <li> ouch ladies be very very very careful when using this! unfortunately my skin is extremely sensitive and i used it myself the peel is amazing follow those directions very very carefully or you will end up with burns sadly i have one on my eye brow but wow does it work my face is so baby soft its almost crazy, it stings a bit then it washes off like it wasnt there and the end result is amazing! yes i will definitely be spreading this around professional peel that works in less time for less money than a facial you got my money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation). I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all). Your experience may differ. The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have always been a products girl. I love to use products because I want that perfect skin that I never&lt;br /&gt;had. My skin is rough, dry and oily at the same time. I also have scalp psoriasis that at times flares on my forehead region. I have really enjoyed testing this product and seeing what it has done for my skin. My skin is so much smoother, less oily and no dry patches. I have been using it once a week for 2 weeks at around a minute a week and have had no issues at all. I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> This was my first lactic acid peel and I was pleasantly surprised! I don&#x27;t have fine lines or wrinkles or sun spots so I can&#x27;t say how it works with that, but it made my skin glowy and smooth! It minimized the appearance of my pores and it helped lighten the dark areas around my nose and mouth and it evened my skin tone in general. I am very happy with the results. I have been using it for about a month just once a week! It has a slightly thick clear liquid and it has an odd spicy smell that I sort of like. The smell is strong but not overpowering, it&#x27;s definitely bearable. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a minute at a time as it does sting my skin and turns it red. Hopefully I will be able to work up to a couple of minutes at a time. I did receive this product for free to try out, but these are my own unbiased opinions! Definitely give this a try if you are looking for a lactic acid peel.</li>
            <li> If you have never used a peel before, this is the one to use! I&#x27;ve been given other peels for gifts before and they really didn&#x27;t do the job, but this peel really works wonders! I do recommend you make sure you do it on a day you aren&#x27;t going out at all or at night before bed so your face has a chance to recover a little before entering civilization again, but really, that&#x27;s normal. I have seen people spend thousands of dollars on chemical peels, and they really don&#x27;t have to do that! Dr. Song&#x27;s Lactic Acid Gel Peel works just like any professional peel and you can do it in the comfort of your own home!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This peel has worked to get rid of old acne scars and marks on my face and my skin tone is more even and pores seem smaller. My skin is bright and healthy. It is super easy to use, just take a cotton ball and spread it over the face being careful not to layer over what has already been covered (that will make it peel more). It took a couple of uses and healing times to see any real results, but that is also normal since the healing is what helps restore and renew the facial skin. My skin is much more healthy looking and my freckles are even beginning to lighten. I just love how my skin looks after using this peel.</li>
            <li> 47 year old here. I was very excited, but nervous to try this peel as I have never used a peel before. I was surprised that I didn&#x27;t have the burning sensation that others have had. I thought maybe I just had a thick layer of dead cells to get rid of! Used it again the very next day. Definitely stung a bit more. My face is definitely benefiting - complexion much brighter and vibrant. My face definitely needed something like this - something to &amp;#34;unglue&amp;#34; all the built-up dead skin.  I look forward to using this product - something that I can&#x27;t say for most skin products.</li>
            <li> This is professional grade! Works wonderfully. Must have a knowledge of peels. I am an Esthetician and this is very strong. I love it!</li>
            <li> I received the peel and have tried it once.  Stings like the dickens, that&#x27;s for sure!  I have read different reports online with respect to how long it takes to see results, but I will keep plugging away every week.  I have a fair (light) complexion and have been using a 2% solution of retinol so I felt like I was prepped for what I consider the next level.  Definitely have a new smoothness to my skin.  Use a moisturizer with a 30 SPF sunscreen for sure!</li>
            <li> I have tried other lactic acid peels and I think this product is far superior!  Thank you.</li>
            <li> After cleansing your skin and drying it, you can apply the Dr. Song Lactic Acid to some dark or hyper pigmented spots on your face or all over. I tend to apply it to my dark spots to my face. It is recommended to only leave on for 1 minute on your first treatment and going up by one minute each time. Of course only do as much time as you need. Everyone will be different. I can do about 2 minutes at a time and of course only once a week.  I also want to remind you, when you do any face peel it is very important to use sunscreen and stay out of the sun for at least 24 hours since your skin can burn easily after using.  What does it feel like? It has a bit of a prickly feeling to the spots you apply this to. The prickly and sometimes burning feeling is normal and don&#x27;t worry. If you do apply it all over, make sure to not get close to your eyes. I would also suggest you  test a spot on your face as well. If it begins to irritate your skin or feel like it is burning, it is recommended to rinse your face with cool water to neutralize it.  My skin&#x27;s dark spots are lightening little by little. I know it is going to take time, but I am happy to see even the slightest results. This is so much more inexpensive than going to the dermatologist and paying lots of money she we can now do it at home. Again just take it slowly and do it little by little. I was sent this for review, however it does not effect my review.</li>
            <li> As recommended, I tried the product using a skin patch test on my hand to ensure I did not have any allergies or reactions to the ingredients. All seemed fine, so I proceeded to use the product as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first tried Dr. Song’s Lactic Acid Facial Peel, using the directions I found on their website, I was not surprised by the warm, tingling sensation I felt. I was careful not to get the thin, viscous serum near my eyes or my nostrils. I did end up getting it too close to my nose for comfort. The warm, tingling sensation lasted a lot longer than I had expected in that area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it only for 1 minute the first time. After this short time, my face felt like your legs do after a fresh shave. I felt like I had new, soft skin. I like that feeling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After subsequent uses, the warm, tingling feeling was not as prevalent as with previous uses. I became more comfortable using it. Since I’m sensitive about what products I use on my face, the fact that I liked the results I felt after using Dr. Song’s Lactic Acid Facial Peel say a lot. I wish I had taken before and after pictures because the results after a few weeks of using it are promising. I really feel like the facial peel tackled the redness of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I felt like the lactic acid peel gave me “new skin” per se. It’s like a gel, as far as the texture is concerned and it’s much lighter of a feel than most facial peels. If you have an aversion to a warming or slight burning sensation, this product is not for you. If you want results and are willing to experience a slight discomfort, this product is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that Dr. Song also offers a line of complimentary products for anti-aging skincare. I like using products that are developed to work together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read more at http://melissasaywhat.com/dr-song-50-lactic-acid-facial-peel-review/#9by8ZEzAPWhPIB4v.99</li>
            <li> Honestly I have never herd of anything called a peel. I have herd of the masks you peel off your face but this was all new to me. When I opened the package I immediately did what was said in the instructions. I washed and dried my face then put some on a cotton ball and smeared it on my face. Now here is were it surprised me. The feeling on my face was like this burning sensation, which may I add was said in the instructions that your first time it might burn. So I kept it on for 1 minute, which also was said in the instructions, then washed it off. I dabbed my face dry and boy did my face feel fresh and clean. My pores could breath and my skin was soft. I can&#x27;t wait to do this in another 4 weeks, also stated in the instructions that you do this once every 4 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is amazing and will make your skin feel amazing. All you have to do is make it through just a little bit of burning sensation, but trust me you will love how your skin feels afterwards.</li>
            <li> I was already using a 12% glycolic acid product daily which is pretty much the Holy Grail, so I decided to up it a very large notch and first try the 40% glycolic acid. It came with instructions to leave it on for 1 minute then increase the time by1-2 minutes with 4 weeks between each use.  It was a little harsher than this stuff, so I was more careful with it.&lt;br /&gt;When the lactic acid came, I was determined to make my whole face peel.  I left it on for about a minute or two the first time again, then a day or so later I did it for 3 minutes.  This really made my nose and chin blister up.  My chin, this time was the only part that peeled and it peeled a lot. I feel like it&#x27;s hard to time how long you need the product on to make certain areas peel because all parts of your face are different in sensitivity and skin thickness-- with time, determination, and documentation, anyone could figure it out .  I may just experiment with the areas that have the most freckles. I also find that I&#x27;m not a big fan of waiting the few days to let my face naturally peel.  And let&#x27;s face it, who doesn&#x27;t have OCD and wouldn&#x27;t also want to  peel and pick on the area?  Plus it&#x27;s sort of embarrassing to be around town with an unidentified skin problem on your face.&lt;br /&gt;With these things said, I am going to continue to use the product, but probably no more that in 2 minute intervals unless I know I&#x27;ll be home for the week-- maybe during Thanksgiving or Spring Break, but with kids, this is hard.  I don&#x27;t have the personality to look terrible around town with my face looking leathery and scaly for a few days while I agree to not disturb the peeling with my fingers (not to mention, using it harshly is more dangerous and I worry about scaring).  I will however, use the product much more often than once a month. (I may even try adding some to my moisturizer.) I think once per week for one minute will slowly and gently take layers off and I&#x27;m confident that it will continue to soften my skin and slough freckles and fade malasma.  I am also hopeful that it helps with some light pink acne scars, but only time will tell!  Lastly, when I go to repurchase these products, as stated I am slightly more drawn to the lactic acid although it is more expensive (it&#x27;s easier to get up close to those check bone lines without irritating the eyes).  I got mine at an introductory price and with a coupon. I see the price is already a bit more so we&#x27;ll see what my threshold is on how much I&#x27;m willing to spend once this bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> I started using it about a week ago. So far I like what I see. I used it mostly on my chin where scarring is from plucking hairs. The first application did remove dried patches and soften the area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once since it says to use it once a week. And so far, it&#x27;s good. I haven&#x27;t had any peeling going on but I like how it makes my face feel smoother. The smell is quite strong when you first open it. The scent reminds me of brown sugar and white vinegar mixed together. I don&#x27;t mind it though since you wash your face after you apply it. It has a sticky consistency, similar to glue but I guess that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s suppose to be. I think this is a great product if you want smoother and brighter skin. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any peeling. I don&#x27;t recommend this for people with sensitive skin so it&#x27;s best you test this on your back of your hand first before applying it on the whole face. This is a great product to use at home instead of spending a lot of money on salons for the same peeling product.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipment ..! Great Product ... love it</li>
            <li> Received my peel with the usual Amazonian speed on 9/27 (mon). Based on some reviews, I figured give or take peeling won&#x27;t be that obvious. So decided to start peel that same night instead of waiting until the weekend! OMG! Tues morning, I was soooo apprehensive about going to work! To my shock, my entire mouth and nose had done some major peeling overnight! Made it thru the day at work and very anxious to see what else happens! Will update!</li>
            <li> This is my take on the product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never done a facial peel before and was very nervous to try it. I followed the directions exactly as instructed in an email to me. First you do a patch test, if no irritation occurs then you can go ahead but do so carefully because face peels can burn! I applied it as instructed for only one minute the first time you try it. Then you rinse off thoroughly with cool/warm water. It does feel tingly when its on your face. I expected my face to be redder after, but luckily that did not occur. If you expose your skin to the sun you MUST apply sunscreen because your skin will be super sensitive to exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I might try it just a little longer next time but not much. I will probably wait about 2 weeks before I do it again. I did notice my pores looked smaller and my skin looked a bit smoother. I did follow up with a very gentle  moisturizer after. I really liked this and would recommend it to people who don&#x27;t have overly sensitive skin. I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I was really scared to try this at first because I didn&#x27;t want to be walking around with peeling blotchy skin.  I am so glad I tried it anyway!  My face feels like a newborns bottom!  Amazing!  Make sure you cut the gel with a little bit of lotion and rinse it off as soon as it \\&quot;tingles.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free to review. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I had never tried a lactic acid face peel prior to being chosen for the Dr Song 50% Lactic Acid Face Peel promotion, I was given the product for free in return for an honest product review.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is a pretty little glass bottle that contains a good amount of the peel. The peel is quite thick so it stays put on your face. It has a light scent. I rubbed the product on my face evenly and let it sit for a few minutes. I noticed a slight burning and itching nothing too uncomfortable. After a few minutes I washed my face thoroughly with cool water. My face was kind of red but nothing too bad. After a few uses I have noticed that my skin tone appears to be a lot more even. My skin has been extremely soft and radiant looking. I feel like I am erasing years of skin damage leaving my with beautiful glowing skin. I suggest you give this product a try!</li>
            <li> I received the gel timely and I used it twice not as strong I hoped but it works. Will just do it more often to get the results I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> I had been using this serum for over 6 months, but no changes at all that I can see on my skin. The dark spots are the same. I had high expectations, I guess, but it did not work for me. It will burn your skin possibly.</li>
            <li> I unwrapped the bottle and the first thing I noticed was that it didn&#x27;t come with directions. Don&#x27;t fear, I used good old Google and found them! This face peel is supposed to be great for wrinkles, hyperpigmentation, scars...just about any facial imperfections that you need a little help with. I did a small skin patch test. This is purely because I remember Samantha from Sex and the City after her chemical peel disaster. If you haven&#x27;t seen it, look it up. It will urge you to test products on small patches of skin before you lather it all over...I promise! It was a little tingly, nothing painful happened. So I went ahead and applied my first peel. I left it on for a minute and as the time went on you could see why you are supposed to work yourself into increasing the time of each peel afterwards. This is some strong stuff! I have really sensitive skin so I wasn&#x27;t surprised when my skin got a little dry and flaky. Nothing a little moisturizer couldn&#x27;t fix. I used an intense moisturizer and it revealed softer and smoother skin. I only did the one peel but I&#x27;m pretty excited to see what the second peel offers. I already notice a difference in my skin. It feels more radiant! If you&#x27;re anything like me and don&#x27;t want to spend big bucks or rather just do it in the comfort of your own home, I would recommend trying this peel. Just make sure that you read all of the directions online clearly and follow them carefully. It&#x27;s so affordable!</li>
            <li> At first I was a little scared when I read &amp;#34;use at your own risk&amp;#34; on the label, but then I read through some of the reviews and didn&#x27;t see anything about skin irritation, I did not read all of the reviews though. So I went for it and it burns and stings pretty bad. It opened up blemishes and made them bleed. I would have expected this if not for the reviews that mentioned none of this. I also could not find instructions with it, but found them on the Dr Song website. You just rub a small amount onto clean skin with a brush or cotton ball, leave on a minute first time, then increase to 2 eventually if needed. After the initial irritation and redness and bleeding, I could definately see a difference in my skin especially after the second and third time.Yes I continue to use, and yes its still somewhat painful and leaves my skin red and blotchy for a day, but after that its like I have a brand new face. Its just so much younger looking, brighter, more beautiful skin. I would recommend this product, and I expect to see more results. I will be using every 2 to 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> Not bad.. I don&#x27;t really have a lot experience with these kinds of products so... I ask around what I should expect. I&#x27;ve only tried it once since I recently received it. I applied it for a minute as suggested for the first time use. My face was really tingling/stinging by then. I rinsed my face in lukewarm tap water and applied an organic moisturizer. ( I had read somewhere in one review that it helps calm the stinging sensation ) and it felt great. My face was a little red for about an hour, nothing too crazy. And the following day a friend commented and asked if I had done something to my face because it looked good.. it fells good too.. I&#x27;ll wait another 4 weeks as suggested for the 2nd application. I love this!</li>
            <li> Using this acid for 3rd time, it is great!! I use it once a week and I notice that my face is looking more even toned and younger. I also have noticed a slight disappearance of acne scars. Either way this peel stimulates collagen production so it is a great step before moving on to stronger peels like TCA or phenol. Product smells like honey too. You will notice dark burn marks tour first 2 to 3 days, but after 6-7 days they are completely gone. I&#x27;m currently leaving it on for 4minutes and feels great. I just neutralize with regular unscented bath soap before applying and neutralize again after applying it with cold water and a lot of soap.</li>
            <li> Good, does the job and is affordable. Thank you Dr. Song. I use this every night; a small amt mixed in my nighttime moisturizer. I know its a peel but this is how I prefer to use it and it works for me. I am not new to this kind of thing.</li>
            <li> I been using this product from Dr. Song for 4weeks now. And I can really say my skin locks so much better. My dark marks on my face starting to fog away, and my skin looks more youthful. And I love the price.&lt;br /&gt;I will order this product again</li>
            <li> Easy to use, clear instructions, great product!</li>
            <li> As someone who was totally apprehensive about using acids on skin, I&#x27;d read the all the reviews here atleast twice, adding to cart and deleting later multiple times before deciding to buy the 50% lactic acid gel peel for my dark underarms. Three weeks later I&#x27;m glad I did. I&#x27;d tried a dozen home remedies before, nothing really helped. I didn&#x27;t want a skin-burn so I meticulously followed the instructions sent by mail, applied this gel twice a week and 3-4 days after every peel I&#x27;ve been excited to notice that my underarms were atleast 2 shades lighter. It didn&#x27;t burn, didn&#x27;t hurt, just felt a slight tingling sensation until you washed the gel off. I just used cold water and I did not even notice any redness on the applied area. All acids tend to leave the skin dry, I recommend a moisturizer after the peel. Lactic acid is milder than other acids so the peeling of skin isn&#x27;t even noticeable unlike the results. Also unlike green peel oils, you can still wash your skin with mild soaps and take a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon after the first application I was not sure if it made any difference, but I&#x27;ve had 4 peels so far and I&#x27;m very happy with the result. I totally recommend this product! None of the reviews here talk about using it for dark underarms but if you do suffer from one, look no further, this stuff really works!</li>
            <li> I love this product. Great customer service and the price is right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it three times now, once weekly and I&#x27;m going to say that the third time was NOT the charm due to the sunburned feeling on my face yesterday. ;)  However, it is doing what it should and people are noticing that my skin looks nice. I&#x27;ve gotten compliments from co-workers unsolicited so that helps when considering next week&#x27;s treatment. I think I&#x27;m going to try for 10 days in between and not put it everywhere. The skin around my nose (like many) is getting too  sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is getting super soft and smooth so I&#x27;m good with this &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; acid.</li>
            <li> Dr.Song&#x27;s Gel peels are very good and the product was quality ingredients. it was so nice to find a wonderful product at a great LUNCH PRICE!!! I will be a loyal and happy customer from now on. I also wanted to thank you for Austin&#x27;s wonderful customer service professionalism with Dr. Song&#x27;s Company. Austin helped with all my questions about the peels and took great care of me as there new and future customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Thank you for a wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;  G.Kelley</li>
            <li> I Purchased this peel this week, delivery was quick. I tried it out for my melasma and I already see a huge difference in my skin..of course I had to diluted it first time around..but second time I wont dilute it so much...I would definetly recommend this dr song product to anyone who is trying to get rid of hyperpigmentation, melisma, acne or any skin related problems</li>
            <li> Did not get any instructions with the product and there is nothing on the bottle to tell you how to use it.</li>
            <li> The product arrived before I expected it.Dr song sent a discount cart. I lost :( .</li>
            <li> This product has changed my life!!!!!! When I was younger I used to be builled all my life because I suffer from pcos and I had extremely bad dark acne scars | pigmentation underneath my chin. I went to doctors and they charged thousands and I was like oh heck no!  So I had to death with my ugly skin for years. My confident level was none. Years later my husband who always supportive told me that he saw on dr oz that lactic peels helps eliminate scars and lighten skin. So I checked here on Amazon , I saw this, purchased it because it was affordable.  I used it 4x a week And within 2 months *this bottle last for 2 months * it elimated all my dark spots! scars and  lightened my chin! I also after i finished applying this, i put coconut oil under my chin because coconut oil helps restore skin. I feel like crying I still can&#x27;t believe it! I am so confident I no longer have to put concealer under my chin. I recommend this to everyone!!!</li>
            <li> Did not work well for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this peel twice so far but I can already see a difference in my skin. I have some acne scarring on my cheeks as well as a fine line on my forehead and I honestly can already see a slight reduction so far. The rest of my skin looks much better too. I did break out a bit after my first treatment but it went away quickly and I didn&#x27;t break out after my second treatment, so just beware that it&#x27;s a possibility. I&#x27;d suggest doing it over the weekend so you have a couple days to let your skin calm down before having to go to work or school. I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars for now because I don&#x27;t want to be overzealous but I&#x27;ll update it after a few more treatments.</li>
            <li> Very good for blemishes and uneven skin tone. I use it with the Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li> Happy I tried it and should have done it sooner.</li>
            <li> This is a great light peel. I just started doing peels recently and they are amazing!! I love this one to use between deeper peels since it&#x27;s not as harsh. No peeling at all, so you don&#x27;t have to go out looking like leather. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I have used this product 2 times. After much research, I chose this product to reduce the appearance of dark spots and fine lines on my face. I am already noticing that the dark spots are fading and my skin feels tighter. It is still too soon to tell what the end result will be. So far, I am pretty pleased. Will post another review after I have completed the treatment.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly. AA with oily acne prone skin and suffer from ingrown hairs. As another reviewer stated if applied on a pimple it will greatly reduce the size very quickly. I wanted to intentionally dry out and burn off pimples; so this has worked wonders for my cause. However, I found it mild in conjunction with retin A, but then again i&#x27;m treating my neck area. I like this product and I hope the quality remains the same after the promotion. Great Buy</li>
            <li> Dr Song 50% Lactic Acid Peel is a professional grade peel that you can do in the comfort of your own home. A skin sensitivity test is recommended as it is with almost all beauty products. This product was wonderful. It was easy to do &amp; I could do it on my own time! No dermatologist or skin specialists for this girl! I HAVE DR SONG!</li>
            <li> super.clears up ur face, minimal peeling</li>
            <li> Just a little bit of a burn but tolerable. Ive noticed a smoother complexion after the 3rd use from this product. Certain areas of the face you have to be more careful like around your mouth because it&#x27;ll get more red, but I love it. Arrived on time great packaging.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works. I have been fighting acne at age 33 since in my 20&#x27;s. I have tried dermatologists, all the stuff you can buy in store, Proactive, Rodan Fields, etc. This is the only thing I have found that gets RID OF my acne scars within a couple of weeks. I still fight acne, but not as bad since I started using this product. It also leaves my face feeling like a baby&#x27;s butt. Haha! I get some light tingling while using but nothing, not even redness, after washing off. But I can tell it is sloughing off the dead skin cells as my skin looks fresher and my scars are nearly gone.</li>
            <li> I had my daughter about a year ago and my whole pregnancy and thereafter I deal with acne on my chin and jaw line that left some severe scars. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of creams and oils that just didn&#x27;t produce results. I&#x27;m happy to say that after only one use of this peel I noticed a huge difference! There is still some scarring that was older that I&#x27;m sure more uses will rectify but it really did address a large portion of the newer scars. I&#x27;m happy to see what could happen in the weeks and months to come! Also, quick shipping and emailed instructions helped the process go much smoother.</li>
            <li> This stuff worked. After about 2 days, all my skin basically rubbed off. However, beware: if you are prone to cold sores... they will pop up all over your face. It is like the top layer of your skin is hiding all kinds of evil things underneath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another note. With the first use, I left the stuff on for about 5 minutes (when it started to burn). I washed it off and felt better. I figured at that point I was being a baby and vowed to last longer next time. However in about 20 minutes (that is 20 minutes after I washed it off during my first use) my face dang near burst into flames. I am pacing around the house fanning my face and trying to seem normal to my husband who said I was a fool for doing it to start with. I was cursing at my phone for not going fast enough trying to find out what people had said online about neutralizing because I couldn&#x27;t remember if it was baking soda or baking powder.  By the way - It is baking SODA. I dumped some baking soda in the bathroom sink and filled it with water. The result was like rubbing sand on a raw sunburn, but it did stop the burning (somewhat).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did it help the overall look of my skin? I am not really sure. Once the first time finished up, I tried again. This time I was ready with the baking soda ahead of time. Still burned, and still felt like sand, but I was ready. Second round, after a few days, brought out cold sores and not just around my nose and mouth. I still have the last one healing, so maybe once that is gone I will go for round 3?</li>
