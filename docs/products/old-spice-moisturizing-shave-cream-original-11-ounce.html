            <li>Old Spice makes the best Shave Cream on the market.</li>
            <li>Old Spice Shaving Cream is the best shaving cream on the market for my beard.</li>
            <li>It was rich and creamy, smelled great, and always gave me a nice clean shave.</li>
            <li>I love Old Spice Shaving Cream its the best Shaving Cream i have ever used.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to find it on amazon . com.</li>
            <li>I wish it was more dense for better skin protection.  </li>
            <li>more per can for cream and much more for gel.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I am glad I found it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I am glad that I was able to find it at Amazon.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find it available through amazon.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this shaving cream for many years, and have always enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>This cream sits on top of your skin without doing anything in the way of moisturizing your hair.</li>
            <li>My favorite shaving cream.</li>
            <li>My Dad is 88 and has been using this for many, many years.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find it anywhere but online.  </li>
            <li>i bought this for my son, its his favorite shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to see that someone had it on sale as we know the company has discontinued it.</li>
            <li>A good price and fast shipping will keep this on my wish list!</li>
            <li>It is also refreshing and has that great Old Spice aromatic scent.</li>
            <li>I get a great shave and my wife loves the smell of Old Spice.</li>
            <li>Old Spice is a great shaving cream that has been around for years.  </li>
            <li>Without a doubt, this is the absolute best product Old Spice has on the market!</li>
            <li>But there are times when I need to shave more quickly, so I tried this in preference to a canned gel.</li>
            <li>I am contemplating buying more just to have a supply, because I am unsure just how long this great product will still be available.</li>
            <li>This stuff is getting hard to find at my shops,so this was a great find for me and a good deal to boot</li>
            <li>no tissue paper on your face with this product just a great shave that last all day</li>
            <li>I bought seven cans and got free shipping.</li>
            <li>Overall I am happy with this shaving cream.</li>
            <li>One last thing is that as the can dissipates, the cream holds its lathering ability better than Barbasol which is a good thing.  </li>
            <li>Glad to see it&#x27;s available online at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I threw the almost full can</li>
            <li>I have never been a big fan of the Old Spice cologne (why would any man wish to destroy the wonderful scent from the shaving cream with a cologne?), but I always loved the original shaving cream.</li>
            <li>i have been using Old Spice Moisturizing Shave Cream Original for over fifty years can&#x27;t stop now what more needs to be said.</li>
            <li>This vintage icon is the best shave cream I have ever used--very think, heavy, and nowhere to be found where I live in Atlanta.  </li>
            <li>: it does a good job lathering and makes a decent cushion for the double edge razor.</li>
            <li>the scent is just right.</li>
            <li>Just because something is discontinued doesent give someone the right to jack the price up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It will cost more to ship them back than they are worth.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, also to the seller, who shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I am happy to have them as it is hard to find.</li>
            <li>Its hard to believe that you can&#x27;t find this product in any of the stores, to find it on the web at this great price.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>smooth lather that doesn&#x27;t smell like an old spice jar.</li>
            <li>Sure enough...</li>
            <li>I found it on the first try &amp; ordered 2 cans.</li>
            <li>Brings back many old memories of days gone by when Old Spice shaving cream was available in the stores.  </li>
            <li>It lathers up splendidly thick, moistens the beard just right, and the razor seems to love it as much as I do, gliding smoothly across the face.</li>
            <li>Certainly they don&#x27;t care about quality, or their customers.</li>
            <li>He really likes the fragrance and the performance of this brand and type of shaving cream.    </li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>My uncle looked everywhere at all the major super centers &amp; could not find it anywhere.</li>
            <li>I typically use a brush and good shaving soap (along with a vintage Gillette double edge razor).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shave cream.</li>
            <li>Too bad because its good stuff!!</li>
            <li>Naturally it has been discontinued!</li>
            <li>It then leaves your face with a satisfying light (never overbearing, but rather faint) fragrance that does not get old or tiring.</li>
            <li>This  product has become hard to find in our area, and it&#x27;s my husband&#x27;s favorite.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Old Spice shave cream for over 25 years now.</li>
            <li>I always get the closest and smoothest shave using Old Spice.</li>
            <li>For me, I have a sensitive nose, and I find the smell of the Old Spice aftersave he uses with this to be overpowering, but that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li>They arrived very well packaged and in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>I wish Old Spice still made this product as it matches the after shave I use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Just use Old Spice aftershave if you like the smell - or use this stuff if you like the \\&quot;scarface\\&quot; look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I purchased this product for my husband...who has been using it for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Have been using this shave cream for years and it has been getting harder and harder to find at my local stores.</li>
            <li> Not sure if Old Spice makes it still.</li>
            <li> and then it closed.</li>
            <li> Other brands have risen to $2 o</li>
            <li> Old Spice shaving cream is very hard to find today.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and would hate to be without it.</li>
            <li> I found out that i cut myself less when using this product.</li>
            <li> O.S. runs about $1.40 or less.  </li>
            <li> A few years ago, it disappeared from store shelves, but I could buy it at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Recently I have been having a very difficult time finding it on the shelves of my local drug store or supermarkets.</li>
            <li> Sadly, it has now been entirely discontinued.</li>
            <li> I am deeply disappointed in this particular seller.</li>
            <li> Too bad Old Spice is no longer manufacturing this product.</li>
            <li> $10 for a can of shaving cream is over priced to say the least.</li>
            <li> It is quite thick yet not quite as dense as Barbasol.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the cans arrived without the little plastic \\&quot;push-down\\</li>
            <li> It is very thick and moist.</li>
            <li> I still rank it a notch below Barbasol, Gillette Foamy and Colgate but definitely won&#x27;t disappoint you.</li>
            <li> But alas is been discontinued!  </li>
            <li> foam is useless for shaving, AND it leaves a rust ring on the tub or shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Crazy.</li>
            <li> I felt like I won the lottery when I received this, given that it&#x27;s almost impossible to find anymore.</li>

            <li> I have used this product for many years and would hate to be without it. All of the drug stores and the grocery stores in my city stopped carrying the product, but one grocery store and then it closed. I was in a panic until finding it availale through Amazon!</li>
            <li> Overall I am happy with this shaving cream. It is quite thick yet not quite as dense as Barbasol.  I wish it was more dense for better skin protection.  It has a pleasant scent but it disappears very quickly. Perhaps its best feature is its price.  Other brands have risen to $2 o more per can for cream and much more for gel.

            <li> This  product has become hard to find in our area, and it&#x27;s my husband&#x27;s favorite.  I was thrilled to find it available through amazon.  Unfortunately, the cans arrived without the little plastic \\&quot;push-down\\&quot; buttons on either can, making them useless.&lt;br /&gt;It will cost more to ship them back than they are worth.

            <li> Have been using this shave cream for years and it has been getting harder and harder to find at my local stores. I was on Amazon.com one day and just checked to see if they might have it. There it was, so I ordered two cans. I get a great shave and my wife loves the smell of Old Spice.

            <li> Wonderful!  Brings back many old memories of days gone by when Old Spice shaving cream was available in the stores.  I have never been a big fan of the Old Spice cologne (why would any man wish to destroy the wonderful scent from the shaving cream with a cologne?), but I always loved the original shaving cream. It lathers up splendidly thick, moistens the beard just right, and the razor seems to love it as much as I do, gliding smoothly across the face. It then leaves your face with a satisfying light (never overbearing, but rather faint) fragrance that does not get old or tiring. Just a great buy. I am contemplating buying more just to have a supply, because I am unsure just how long this great product will still be available. Thanks, also to the seller, who shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this cream, if you can call it that. This cream sits on top of your skin without doing anything in the way of moisturizing your hair. It&#x27;s practically just for show.</li>
            <li> Old Spice Shaving Cream is the best shaving cream on the market for my beard. It provides the proper moisture&lt;br /&gt;and the scent is just right. It is the only shaving cream that I use.</li>
            <li> This stuff is getting hard to find at my shops,so this was a great find for me and a good deal to boot</li>
            <li> My favorite shaving cream. I felt like I won the lottery when I received this, given that it&#x27;s almost impossible to find anymore.</li>
            <li> I love Old Spice Shaving Cream its the best Shaving Cream i have ever used. My one star review is for the price that some amazon sellers are charging. Are they on glue??? $10 for a can of shaving cream is over priced to say the least. Just because something is discontinued doesent give someone the right to jack the price up.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find in stores anymore. Glad to see it&#x27;s available online at a reasonable price. Not sure if Old Spice makes it still.</li>
            <li> My Dad is 88 and has been using this for many, many years.  He loves it!  I haven&#x27;t been able to find it anywhere but online.  Sure was happy to find it there!</li>
            <li> i bought this for my son, its his favorite shaving cream. But alas is been discontinued!  Too bad because its good stuff!! Seller did great and the product arrived on time Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I wish Old Spice still made this product as it matches the after shave I use. It is a very good product of this type.</li>
            <li> My razor gets caught, and I&#x27;ve cut myself. I&#x27;ve still got a slice on my face that hasn&#x27;t healed in a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to shake the can to keep it from being a watery mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T BUY THIS STUFF! I threw the almost full can away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just use Old Spice aftershave if you like the smell - or use this stuff if you like the \\&quot;scarface\\&quot; look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This foam is useless for shaving, AND it leaves a rust ring on the tub or shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is made by Proctor and Gamble, who bought the brand in 1990. What were they thinking? Certainly they don&#x27;t care about quality, or their customers.</li>
            <li> Too bad Old Spice is no longer manufacturing this product. It was rich and creamy, smelled great, and always gave me a nice clean shave. The only way to buy this product, is to buy it from vendors who have left over stock, and are selling it at an exorbitant price. $12.99 for one 11oz can...Crazy.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this shave cream for years.  I was pleased to see that someone had it on sale as we know the company has discontinued it.</li>
            <li> Old Spice is a great shaving cream that has been around for years.  But you cannot find it in the stores anymore.  We love it!</li>
