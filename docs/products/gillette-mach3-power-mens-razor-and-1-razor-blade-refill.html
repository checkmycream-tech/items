            <li>GREAT ITEM!</li>
            <li>The best think I can say about this</li>
            <li>Great shaving kit for me, thank you !!!</li>
            <li>Excellent shaver.</li>
            <li>Very good razor</li>
            <li>so, it&#x27;s a very good razor</li>
            <li>and  makes an ideal shaving tool for me.</li>
            <li>for the blade, it works great, but quite overpriced for just the blade.  </li>
            <li>Shaving is a pain-free joy now, and the vibration feature of this power razor provides plenty of audible queues as to the effectiveness of the shaving experience.  </li>
            <li>Works great</li>
            <li>Great razor for price, but</li>
            <li>I wondered about how this might be a great razor at the time I ordered it.</li>
            <li>Great item.</li>
            <li>just how great it works.</li>
            <li>Works great my hubby uses and it reduces his razor burn to nil.</li>
            <li>After that, it worked great.</li>
            <li>and it works great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just ok and best for folks that want a lighter shaving experience.</li>
            <li>LMAO at this one!  </li>
            <li>Again: LMAO!</li>
            <li>fair price for a good shaver</li>
            <li>admit this product worked surprisingly well.  </li>
            <li>Yup - the battery is even included; always a good way to score bonus points with me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But perhaps with good running start and a catapult....</li>
            <li>The pressure is always a perfect, light touch, gliding across my face.</li>
            <li>Coated Blades - apparently it&#x27;s a good thing</li>
            <li>Coated Blades - apparently it&#x27;s a good thing</li>
            <li>Works great nice close shave .</li>
            <li>I did surprisingly like the &#x27;power&#x27; feature though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be fair, this razor provided a good shave for me.</li>
            <li>I got this razor since it seemed like a good idea, a razor that vibrates.</li>
            <li>My shaving experience is not as good either.</li>
            <li>Probably the best razor available in the market.</li>
            <li>We received a battery-powered (battery included) vibrating razor with a blade good for sensitive-skin.</li>
            <li>surprisingly good version of the venerable Mach3 setup and</li>
            <li>This razor is very comfortable to the hand and gives a great shave.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>works great, really satisfied with the price and durability.</li>
            <li>I love this thing!</li>
            <li>So pleased!</li>
            <li>I can almost guarantee that you will love it!</li>
            <li>This is my first time using an electric safety razor, and I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
            <li>Best price ever found happy saving days ever since better new design</li>
            <li>Nice product</li>
            <li>Nice to see you again.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me, sometimes cheaper really IS as good as spending more.</li>
            <li>But to each his own...</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me, sometimes cheaper really IS as good as spending more.</li>
            <li>But to each his own...</li>
            <li>Loving it.</li>
            <li>The vibration does seem to cut my hair better, but it works well without the vibration, which is good if that battery dies.</li>
            <li>Yes, it did make it feel kind of nice</li>
            <li>The style is good, easy to grip.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Mach 3 razors for years; they&#x27;re the most effective and longest-lasting disposable razors on the market.</li>
            <li>Good smooth shave although has caused nicks.</li>
            <li>Still best shave for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Very smooth, no cuts.  </li>
            <li>Cost effective, efficient, easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and gives a nice smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using Gillette razors for a while now, so I thought I&#x27;d give this a chance, but when compared to the razor with more blades and a sideburn precision trimmer (profusion)</li>
            <li>all I got was more scratches with this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is better than any of newer models with out vibration models.</li>
            <li>Love these razors.</li>
            <li>That cost Gillette the top star.</li>
            <li>I love this razor.</li>
            <li>I wondered why I would want my razor to vibrate, but once you try it you will love it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why the vibration should be anything more than a gimmick, but it seems to work.</li>
            <li>my favorite razor.</li>
            <li>Nice, smooth shaving with this.</li>
            <li>but the pulsations make the shave so much better</li>
            <li>he used to be me, when I had more spring in my step.</li>
            <li>Nice n smooth...</li>
            <li>I love this razor.  </li>
            <li>Been shaving 59 years, mostly wet-shaving with d/e blades.</li>
            <li>Although this product looks interesting, it works</li>
            <li>/&gt;While this razor might be okay for a lady to shave her legs, (and I wouldn&#x27;t swear to that), I found it to be lacking for shaving one&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li>Each cartridge has 3 advance coating blades for a better shave.</li>
            <li>Perfect grip, overall weight is just right&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Before blaming the razor for any shortcomings, be sure its not your preparation before shaving that&#x27;s at fault.  </li>
            <li>A nice and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>I am sure the numbr of blades help with that too.</li>
            <li>I love this shaver, I have been using the Mach3 since they came out.</li>
            <li>The blades are dirt cheap!</li>
            <li>This latest iteration has built in motorized vibrations to help with blade to skin contact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s important for me to have a shaver that does a good, smooth job and protects me from myself.</li>
            <li>This one seems to do a better job and prevent that, allowing more uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li>process is so smooth!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been pleased with the Mach 3  blades.</li>
            <li>I was glad to be able to use my existing blades.</li>
            <li>Prefer the Fusion slightly more, but this is lower cost per shave.</li>
            <li>While that works better than running water from the front, it doesn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li>nothing fancy, nothing great, just a decent razor.  </li>
            <li>I have tried most types (including safety razors) and brand, including most Gilette models and, for some reason, this gives me the most comfortable shave of all.</li>
            <li>Very happy it lasted as long as it did.</li>
            <li>And, regardless of the effect of that feature, the shaver itself is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used in a long life of dreaded shaves.</li>
            <li>+ Vibration helps move it across skin a bit more easily</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used all kinds of &#x27;breakthrough&#x27; blades for sensitive skin, but they honestly didn&#x27;t work as good as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>quite a large amount, surprisingly.</li>
            <li>this more clean appealing color&lt;br /&gt;Luis</li>
            <li>It remains the best of any major razor brand that I&#x27;ve used but still looking for a closer, more consistent shave.</li>
            <li>far I&#x27;m happy with this Gillette.  </li>
            <li>instead of a shave gel or a non-aerosol shave cream, I got a great shave on my 60+ year old face.</li>
            <li>They work a lot better than most electrics, have pretty good blade life, and a more reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>The market for razors that work best with sensitive skin has an exceptionally capable solution.  </li>
            <li>&gt; Easy to Rinse</li>
            <li>;oD/&gt;&gt; Easy to Rinse</li>
            <li>It has a great feel in the hand and the grips are better than those on the standard Mach3 handles.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To begin with, installing the included battery is easy.  </li>
            <li>I liked it very much.</li>
            <li>Pretty nice.  </li>
            <li>But the Mach3 is hands down the best shave I have had to date.  </li>
            <li>Then purchased the Gillette Mach 3 Sensitive Power Razor and what a pleasant difference.  </li>
            <li>This is a very good product but be sure to have the power off when shaving tight spots or the razor can cut into your skin.</li>
            <li>It glides so smoothly and doesn&#x27;t even irritate my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed at the results everyday.</li>
            <li>more of a gimmick rather than a useful product.</li>
            <li>It was so cheaply made that it made me wonder if this unit was either</li>
            <li>I shave everyday and this is the best razor I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The blades are still available here and there, but the M3 Power razor was discontinued.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;+ Easy to clean under running tap</li>
            <li>She said that she doesn&#x27;t have that information available which is why I question the accuracy of the information I got on the phone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than that, this is a great razor and is similar to the Fusion I use every day.</li>
            <li>However sometimes it doesn&#x27;t do the greatest job on a couple nooks and crannies on my face, but I&#x27;ve yet to try a razor that didn&#x27;t have trouble with those spots.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s highly recommended for buyers who are looking for an easy, comfortable, effective shave without dropping a lot of money on an electric razor.</li>
            <li>I originally thought that the vibration feature was a gimmick</li>
            <li>I needed another but could not find the original on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>top of all this, the replacement cartridges are, apparently, pretty expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>However I&#x27;m very pleased with it so far.</li>
            <li>I had the original turbo when it came out but after years of abuse it broke.</li>
            <li>Best shave for sensitive skin, the vibration is in my opinion the key.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t think it shaves any better than the regular Mach3 did.</li>
            <li>then that I would pick a razor with a better cut, I think it&#x27;s because it only has 3 blades it doesn&#x27;t get too close of a cut still nice to have</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they put a lot of effort into making the glide strip better for sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Mach 3 for a long time and this is a very nice upgrade from that razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another concern is what is the best way to clean the cartridge without causing it to get dull as a result?</li>
            <li>there are too many blades (5) that causes the shaving head to be too large.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special.  </li>
            <li>Mach3 Sensitive is amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a good razor, but the vibration is just a gimmick, I went back to my profusion, and I think I&#x27;ll stay with</li>
            <li>FULL DISCLOSURE:</li>
            <li>Refill cartridges are reasonably priced, and it&#x27;s a worthwhile investment if you suffer from irritation after shaving.</li>
            <li>Cool Stuff:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cool</li>
            <li>Cool</li>
            <li>The problem is, it absolutely doesn&#x27;t create a better shave.  </li>
            <li>using a handle with good weight (like the metal Mach3 or Mach3 Turbo handle) is a key part of the shaving process.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, as a stand-alone product, this razor is still good enough to be called a Gillette.  </li>
            <li>The Mach 3 regular power razor and blades are just as good.</li>
            <li>It adds just a little something that makes shaving even easier and more pleasant.</li>
            <li>I have an electric razor, but I use the Mach 3 Sensitive Power more because it&#x27;s so easy and because it works so well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Personally I feel they are better in almost every respect than most all others on the market--or</li>
            <li>but I quickly became accustomed to the vibrations.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>blade will get ruined quickly.  </li>
            <li>Super close shave without the nicks and cuts.  </li>
            <li>A nice blade shave just feels better than any other.</li>
            <li>I suppose there may be something newer and better and lots more expensive out there, but i&#x27;m happy with the Mach III line and the powered wands.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But the bottom line is going to be how long the cartridge lasts, &amp; whether the razor is a good value as a result.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and could not shave more that once or twice a week without problems.</li>
            <li>I am blonde and do not have very course or thick hair, but if Mach3 in general works perfectly for my legs and perfectly for my husband&#x27;s course facial hair, seems like it is a sure bet for everyone.  </li>
            <li>I could shave with only water or very light soap, the blade is that gentle but still provides a top notch shave.  </li>
            <li>I own several styles of Fusion Mach5 blade shaving units from Gillette.  </li>
            <li>It actually feels nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to have a baby face again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to have a baby face again.</li>
            <li>The Gillette Mach 3 razor remains my favorite razor, having served me well for nearly a decade.</li>
            <li>So far I think I like the non-power model better.</li>
            <li>So, you maybe able to save some dough just buying the old blades if you don&#x27;t care about color matching.  </li>
            <li>It works okay, but a normal Mach 3 gets you a much closer shave!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth</li>
            <li>Nice solid shave.</li>
            <li>This one seems lighter and more plasticky than the older model I still have, which feels more solid and still works after 10+ years.</li>
            <li>Basically I would consider the razor to be a good value if I get at least a month out of a [[ASIN:B00AFCOUXG cartridge at today&#x27;s pricing;]] preferably more like 2 months.</li>
            <li>As it is, it&#x27;s right where I grip when I use this unit</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of blades &#x3D; 3.</li>
            <li>First... I ain&#x27;t most men, and basically every shaver cuts me, so I have to be discretionary with a vengeance, as I bleed easily, and flow long.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth enough so that it doesn&#x27;t hurt to go over the various ridges on your face, and effective enough so that when you get done, you find that you&#x27;ve got a nice, clean look going.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad razor, but I really don&#x27;t see what the electric motor is supposed to do -</li>
            <li>I usually keep a beard to help curb flair-ups, but still like to have a good, clean shave from time to time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First the good: This is the closest shave I have ever had from a powered razor, hands down.</li>
            <li>Right now I am just trimming of beard, but it&#x27;s very nice to have that little vibration as I trim very intricate parts of my face.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve found significantly great shaves using everything from lesser brand name razors (Schick Hydro 5) to essentially generic brands you can get for 75% cheaper</li>
            <li>It does this in all the places which are easy to get to but in those troublesome curves, I ended up having to use my old stand-by disposable razor to finish</li>
            <li>The Mach3 Sensitive is a good razor, I don&#x27;t see where it was necessary to discontinue the M3 Power and release a near-identical razor with higher priced blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far, I have not found that it improves the shaving experience, which is already pretty good with a standard Mach 3 razor.</li>
            <li>I like it very much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad Gillette brought these razors back.</li>
            <li>I had the first model in the market still works</li>
            <li>Have been using same razor for many years until it broke.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Who is that sweet, smooth baby face staring back at me in the mirror?</li>
            <li>I saw this Mach3 Sensitive was available, and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always preferred the styling of a Gillette to pretty much everything else if the truth be told, but does it really shave better for those of us guys with sensitive skin?</li>
            <li>My first one lasted 8 years.</li>
            <li>I guess this is my 3rd or 4th one in maybe 10 years or more?</li>
            <li>I will give the power unit more uses, but because I think the blades of the non-power unit blades last longer for me</li>
            <li>Not useless on course beard hair like 4 blades are.</li>
            <li>Not only have the prices of the disposable cartridges gone up through the roof, there are better options out there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Mach 3 in various forms since its introduction more than a decade ago.  </li>
            <li>Battery life seems ok, about three weeks if used daily.</li>
            <li>The difference between a regular one and a power one is striking.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with Schick ST2 disposables and Extreme3 Disposables since they&#x27;re better than anything Gillette has made in the last 25 years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just used to first shaves being harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love these razors and especially the feature of shaving with vibrator</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will openly admit that like many others, this economy has had a severe impact on my entire life &amp; lifestyle, &amp; these days I approach many of these reviews as not only based on quality but more so on a price to quality</li>
            <li>the not so good:&lt;br /&gt;During my first shave</li>
            <li>Still a very solid razor I&#x27;ve used for years when I need my face to be super smooth.  </li>
            <li>The most important thing to note about this razor is that it was previously sold as the Gillette M3 Power, which has been on the market for years.</li>
            <li>At the end of the day I&#x27;m going to look around my local stores for the old original style mach 3 which is heavier and feels more durable.</li>
            <li>I liked the head pivot, the lubrication strip was good for my sensitive skin, and the little motor made it easier to get through my neck &amp; facial stubble without feeling like it was being yanked out with a pair of pliers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I personally got this for my Dad and he really likes this product and will order more.</li>
            <li>(average is $0.15/blade if you buy a 100 pack), and the shave is better quality with less irritation, even though there is a learning curve and technique is more important, well worth the switch.</li>
            <li>I know many people probably keep their razors for more than three uses ($$$), but after the third use with a regular mach 3, it is very rough on my skin and leaves me with more rashes.  </li>
            <li>She told me pretty much that there are 2 part numbers with every Gillette product, one that comes with a case and one that does not.  </li>
            <li>It shaves pretty well, much closer/smoother than any electric I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not exactly sure what the gain is with this shaver that one gets by activating the battery-operated electric function, but the humming buzz feels good on my face when that&#x27;s going.</li>
            <li>/&gt;What&#x27;s more, I have been an off-and-on fan of wet shaving, and  of course, every first shave with a new DE -- no matter how mild -- results in nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li>The handle portion is very light and feels pretty cheaply made, I feel like it would break if I gripped it too hard.  </li>
            <li>The vibration does nothing but make a less effective shave.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>the Mach 3 Fusion Power and Mach 3 Sensitive Power razors are the same design and the blades are only slightly different, I&#x27;ll just stick with the Gillette Mach 3 Fusion Power, which has always given me a great close comfortable shave for years.</li>
            <li>overall happy with product but often it will break if the suction holder that I use in the shower falls down.  </li>
            <li>At first I wondered why Gillette was trying to continue the Mach3 brand seeing as it was several years old already and has seen better days, but I jumped in and ordered mine anyway.</li>
            <li>I tried the Gillette Mach3 Sensitive Power Razor and have to say it proves a good, long lasting shave.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my fourth use with this blade and it still feels fine.  </li>
            <li>First, the next paragraph is what I originally wrote 2 days after receipt of the razor on 3/7/13:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Would rate higher if I cared for the main selling point of this model, the &amp;#34;power&amp;#34;/vibrate feature.</li>
            <li>This is a very highly recommended razor.</li>
            <li>Perhaps Gillette spoiled us with their other products, but this particular item is decent, nothing spectacular</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very soft and nice but other</li>
            <li>They are $14 each at my drug store and they are much cheaper on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the power one over the regular one.</li>
            <li>Too much blood loss.  </li>
            <li>The vibrating feature really helps get a close shave and causes a decrease in irritation which really helps.</li>
            <li>Has Gillette quality really descended to this level of cheapness?  </li>
            <li>Some of them are really terrible.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When did disposable blades become modern tech?  </li>
            <li>I forgot how much technology has changed from 3 blade to 4 blade.</li>
            <li>The power feature really gives a closer shave under the arms.</li>
            <li>but it really does help.  </li>
            <li>So, thanks for making this razor.</li>
            <li>It feels very unforgiving.  </li>
            <li>Because the razor vibrates, you don&#x27;t need to use any real pressure to get a very close shave.</li>
            <li>a guess really.</li>
            <li>Not irritating on skin like 2 blade razors are.</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t really see the point of the battery-operated vibration.  </li>
            <li>I found that it works quite well though the sensation is unusual.  </li>
            <li>Instead of feeling ripped out of my skin, their really isn&#x27;t any feeling as they are cut</li>
            <li>This razor is definitely worth a shot if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Much easier to use</li>
            <li>but did it really improve the shave?  </li>
            <li>Really?  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a fan of the Mach3 line since they came out, but went a bit cheap in the last 6 months by picking up a set of Mangum 5 razors and replacement heads that were one sale at Costco.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Trying out the Mach3 Sensitive on some areas that were prone to redness and sensitivity after shaving didn&#x27;t show any useful result.  </li>
            <li>Disposable Gillete&#x27;s are much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Really?????  </li>
            <li>I love that it vibrates, which actually helps me avoid razor burn since I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>, wich STILL offers a shave just as good as the most expensive ProGlide razor promises.</li>
            <li>, wich STILL offers a shave just as good as the most expensive ProGlide razor promises.</li>
            <li>I would have added more rubber to the handle to make it easier to hold and the other being changing the placement of the power button.</li>
            <li>I will not purchase anything else, still don&#x27;t care for more than 3 blades and whatever other fancy shenanigans are out there.</li>
            <li>This razor works well, but not any better than other good-quality razors on the market.  </li>
            <li>back to the original 3/7/13 review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I cite as a good alternative example, the Schick Hydro 5 razor (although in the last several months I&#x27;ve noticed the prices on that razor have gone up considerably), and a few Bic disposable 4 bladed razors work exceptionally well, especially when factoring in price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;And finally some even better news: regular blue Venus cartridges fit this razor and snap on without any problems -</li>
            <li>My husband likes his new razor but forgets to turn it on because he really cant tell much difference with vibrate on or off.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In total, it&#x27;s not a bad razor.  </li>
            <li>The expense of the cartridges is why I&#x27;ve knocked off a star, but I&#x27;m sure the price will eventually come down.</li>
            <li>will but again.&lt;br /&gt;saved more than half than buying it at the supermarket.</li>
            <li>Less than a month, I&#x27;m financially better off using premium hand razors.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bought to replace older Mach 3 vibrator handle that gave out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was a relief to find that this razor handle fit the old, regular Mach3 blades I found stashed away while cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I had an older Mach 3 that I&#x27;ve had for years.  </li>
            <li>I had one of the older styles for 10 years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent razor, with plenty of blades and a swivel head</li>
            <li>The main difference is, in all honesty, that this is a cheaper version of the Fusion.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- Fits decently well in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>very fair, sensitive skin, reddish blonde hair and my skin is covered with lots of little bumps and birth marks - only vibrating shavers</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s a great little shaver.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t really judge this razor until I see how long the cartridge lasts, &amp; as we&#x27;re requested to get these reviews up quickly, please consider this a place holder.</li>
            <li>Been shaving with Mach 3 for years and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>and I recommend getting it if the cost isn&#x27;t too high</li>
            <li>Love this little razor.</li>
            <li>And it delivered on being a great size to handle all the contours and difficult spots on the neck and under the chin</li>
            <li>On rare occasion, irritation would make itself present when exceeding a blade count of three.  </li>
            <li>Replaceable Blade Cartridges - obvious but still worth saying&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>Replaceable Blade Cartridges - obvious but still worth saying&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed this with subsequent shaves, but thought it was worth noting all the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pair that with the normal Mach 3</li>
            <li>The button that turns on the vibrations is conveniently placed where I normally apply pressure with my thumb, and while it hasn&#x27;t happened often, I have accidentally turned off the vibrating feature.  </li>
            <li>Vibration helps clean shave in a single sweep</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this product is ok but doesn&#x27;t leave my skin much less irritated/red than my Fusion.  </li>
            <li>I bought this new razor for my husband to replace his Mach3 Turbo.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simply a new name and a new paint job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In the last several months, I have discovered a generic brand 5-bladed razor that you can purchase at Kroger which looks suspiciously like the Gillette ProGlide (but the razors are not compatible with the other handles in case you were wondering), also I found a 6-bladed model at Walgreens which gives a great shave as well...</li>
            <li>I have an obscure skin disorder called Porphyria, which basically means I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>To get a close shave on very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>This version offers vibrations for added &amp;#34;comfort&amp;#34; and less &amp;#34;irritation.&amp;#34; The vibrations don&#x27;t really add much to my shaving experience, but the razors are sharp and last a fair amount of time before needing to be replaced.  </li>
            <li>Wow !</li>
            <li>Everything else felt exactly the same...</li>
            <li>stay on the Power Sensitive handle at all!).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit jarring at first, especially in the mornings.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the vibration actually makes the shave gentler or it just changes the amount of pressure I apply intuitively, but this has given me a nick-free shave on the FIRST shave.  </li>
            <li>sensitive skin shaving cream is more like a creamy oil &amp; a little goes a longgg way!</li>
            <li>but this is about Gillette&#x27;s new Mach3 Sensitive razor.</li>
            <li>new Power Sensitive handle</li>
            <li>is my first time using a Mach 3 with the vibrating action, and it makes a BIG difference.</li>
            <li>I first saw a dynamic safety razor nearly 50 years ago.</li>
            <li>at least that WAS my opinion before I tried several different brands which offered me a great, smooth shave without the stupidly high prices that usually accompany Gillette products.</li>
            <li>This is a very soft comfortable razor, I wish it would cut a little closer</li>
            <li>Not true that \\&quot;all Mach 3 cartridges fit on all Mach 3 razors/handles.\\</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell, my old Mach 3 Turbo blades are exactly the same except for the color.</li>
            <li>He Is blind and this easily gives him a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The old MP3 power blades are still available (at the time this review is being written) and the cost of the M3 Power blades are less than the cost of the Mach3 Sensitive blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The handle itself is plastic which I found to be a little too light --</li>
            <li>close accurate minimal lacerating shaver with low entry fee.</li>
            <li>the vibration action doesn&#x27;t do anything noticeable -</li>
            <li>but Is so old that I had the need for</li>
            <li>sensitive shave gel</li>
            <li>Having sensitive skin, this stops irritation almost completely for me.</li>
            <li>but the shave was neither sensitive or close.</li>
            <li>In fact I found myself going over it again with an old Gillette just to get the shave I was expecting.</li>
            <li>He also says the sensitive blade is soothing.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend it for sensitive skin like his.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even used to do straight razor shaves, when I was younger and my skin could still handle it, and had a steadier hand.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s kinda cute, or at least that&#x27;s what my hubby says.</li>

            <li>B00AFCP6W0 Gillette Mach3 Sensitive Power Cartridges -- 10 Count]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>would not waste my time on this product.  </li>
            <li>It basically allows me to get the same level of shaving effectiveness without having to apply any real pressure to the shaver.</li>
            <li>My husband loves the Mach 3 Sensitive razor.</li>
            <li>There is no difference between the handle or blades of Mach3 Sensitive Power and M3 Power.</li>
            <li>The power vibration was a bit strange when I first used it</li>
            <li>This time I bought the sensitive razor and cartridge.</li>
            <li>so introduced the Mach 3 Sensitive Razor.  </li>
            <li>Works just like the old one.</li>
            <li>The vibration action helps the razor glide along skin and also helps rinse clear the blades when rinsing in water.</li>
            <li>I really just wanted a Mach3 shaver in a color different than my husband&#x27;s, so that&#x27;s why I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>real question is how does it perform against the regular, non vibrating models?</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can use all the Mach 3 blades for this Sensitive model.  </li>
            <li>Sensitive version is lighter than the Fusion version.  </li>
            <li>This motorized version makes it possible to get a close shave while preventing one from exerting too much pressure.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and often develop a rash on my neck when shaving.  </li>
            <li>This sensitive power razor seems like just the ticket!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>far I haven&#x27;t had any rash on my neck while using this.  </li>
            <li>Just get the Neutrogena Sensitive Skin Shaving Cream instead :</li>
            <li>Replacements are around $20 for 8, so that&#x27;s nearly 3 months for me</li>
            <li>But this Power Mach3 Sensitive is persuading me otherwise.  </li>
            <li>this Mach3 was like the difference between night and day, a much smoother shave without needing to go cover the same spot multipe</li>
            <li>at least 3 more shaves after that&#x27;s turned</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, the vibrations are supposedly beneficial for people with sensitive skin, which I have.  </li>
            <li>One thing I found quite helpful in one of the reviews was a the statement, \\&quot;Do not be fooled by the changing of the green or blue strip at the top of the cartridge: I&#x27;ve found that I can get</li>
            <li>+ The green strip for sensitive skin really works - it feels much better than any other shaver I had before&lt;</li>
            <li>The shave is more gentle and has less possibility of cut even when I moved the razor a little faster by accident.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t remember when this last happened, even with Fusion razors or older cartridge</li>
            <li>Based on the thoroughness of a couple of the other reviews, I have to assume that either those reviewers received different packaging than I did, or were extremely familiar with this razor line already.</li>
            <li>When used in that particular area, the vibrations actually make the blades pull my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have to use repetitive, short strokes up my neck just to remove most of it just to have some stubble remain and no close shave.</li>
            <li>I was wondering why they stopped producing the Mach 3 Power back then when I was looking for a new razor handle as my old one died after 3 years of use.</li>
            <li>Gillette&#x27;s new Mach 3 Sensitive Power Razor is not much different from their Mach 3 Fusion Power Razor.</li>
            <li>If you never tried a \\&quot;power\\&quot; razor, feel free to try one with a tiny caveat that you will slightly overpay for your trial and error.  </li>
            <li>So over the decades, remembering Remington as one that was mild... Minimal white collar tragedies.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing that it means that either the Mach3 Sensitive does nothing for my skin that another Mach3 can&#x27;t, but perhaps my skin isn&#x27;t sensitive enough to need a sensitive razor like this one.</li>
            <li>The vibration appears to provide no real benefit, it&#x27;s made of pretty flimsy feeling plastic, and otherwise is just unimpressive.</li>
            <li>Tried it twice and went back to the normal Mach3.</li>
            <li>Little did we know that the vibration would produce such a close smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Very worth the small up front expense.</li>
            <li>Perhaps Gillett will introduce a new model later</li>
            <li>Part of the issue is there are numerous languages on the package; &amp; as such there isn&#x27;t room to say much of anything in any of them!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works pretty well on my legs too, but I have to go pretty slow for fear of nicking.</li>
            <li>My prior experience with the power Mach 3 (which broke at the handle after 5 years or so where the battery cover is located due to my habit of banging it on the sink edge while shaving to remove hair and cream debris which I have learned not to do anymore) was almost an enjoyable experience if that is possible and the Fusion blades are even more expensive, so I began looking for this.</li>
            <li>do not cause major</li>
            <li>I have very thick facial hair and the razor left my face feeling smooth and with a shave that would last a full day.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure, but vibration may help clean the blade.</li>
            <li>I had the original a few years back.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do anything special for my face and is kind of annoying.  </li>
            <li>Batteries seem to last a long time and they really give a closer, smoother shave than the non-powered models.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not sure if the vibration feature really makes all that much of a difference.</li>
            <li>Apparently, some of the blades had been stocked up and then the razor mistakenly thrown away.  </li>
            <li>I DID notice, however after my first shave--which I found to be very comfortable--that I had a larger number of areas where I was bleeding than usual...</li>
            <li>but it feels like it has the same weight as the old Mach 3/Turbo with the battery inside.  </li>
            <li>The Sensitive Power razor is basically the same design as the Fusion Power razor with it&#x27;s battery operated vibrating blades, and the only noticeable difference is the blades seam a bit sharper on the Sensitive Power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since</li>
            <li>I recently purchased replacement blades, and hubby requested the Mach3 Sensitive blades.</li>
            <li>&quot; That apparently is when Gillette suggests changing the blade, &amp; mine came with nothing stating that.</li>
            <li>idea behind this razor is that it vibrates, which is supposed to create a better shave.  </li>
            <li>The vibration occurs at a much higher frequency and you don&#x27;t have the problem of it slowing down because you don&#x27;t need to rewind it.</li>
            <li>Fusion&#x27;s blades are too close together and hard to clean.</li>
            <li>And the blade has stayed sharp MUCH longer than the cheapie</li>
            <li>He gets a very close shave with this razor which I guess he says is partly due to</li>
            <li>While I new what to expect from prior experience with the standard Mach 3, this razor actually exceeded those expectations.  </li>
            <li>Actually, nor do the M3 Power blades, if you pull on them a bit (but they do fit somewhat, at least, whereas the Mach 3 Turbo blades do not fit/</li>
            <li>Personally I find no difference in effect when using, but a big difference in price when purchasing \\&quot;sensitive mach 3\\&quot; vs, mach 3.</li>
            <li>Starting with the regular Mach 3, then Mach 3 Turbo, and now Mach 3 Sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly certain we moved on the the &amp;#34;mach 3 standard&amp;#34; for currency back in the 90s, given the extreme cost of the replacement blades.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fine when I&#x27;m shaving my neck and cheeks, but it does a terrible job on my chin and isn&#x27;t good at all when used between my nose and upper lip.&lt;br</li>
            <li>in fact, it makes it less comfortable as it&#x27;s more difficult to hold on to with wet hands while the thing is vibrating.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had sensitive skin for as long as I remember.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a long time Fusion power user and thought maybe this sensitive would be comparable, it wasn&#x27;t even close.  </li>
            <li>The shave is what you would expect from any other mach 3, the super lubricated mega strip or whatever they call it these days feels the same as my other mach 3 blades.  </li>
            <li>I found turning it off, and just using the razor was a much closer shave, with less areas that need to touched</li>
            <li>My skin is too sensitive to use this for a dry shave.</li>
            <li>Now, the seedy corners of my mind want me to delve into an area of shaving certain body parts wherein vibrations would be very, um, exciting, but I&#x27;m going to refrain from such sophomoric desires and attempt to take a serious shot at reviewing this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>+ Blades last long, even despite the &#x27;cooling strip&#x27; wearing down first</li>
            <li>Wet shaving with gel is like a dream, and dry shaving is completely painless and almost completely effortless.</li>
            <li>In other words, ONLY the Mach 3 Sensitive Power blades in particular stay firmly attached (even with pulling/tugging) on the Mach 3 Power Sensitive handle.  </li>

            <li> Great shaving kit for me, thank you !!!</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver.</li>
            <li> Very good razor</li>
            <li> so, it&#x27;s a very good razor</li>
            <li> and  makes an ideal shaving tool for me.</li>
            <li> for the blade, it works great, but quite overpriced for just the blade.  </li>
            <li> Shaving is a pain-free joy now, and the vibration feature of this power razor provides plenty of audible queues as to the effectiveness of the shaving experience.  </li>
            <li> Works great</li>
            <li> Great razor for price, but</li>
            <li> I wondered about how this might be a great razor at the time I ordered it.</li>
            <li> Great item.</li>
            <li> just how great it works.</li>
            <li> Works great my hubby uses and it reduces his razor burn to nil.</li>
            <li> After that, it worked great.</li>
            <li> and it works great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok and best for folks that want a lighter shaving experience.</li>
            <li> LMAO at this one!  </li>
            <li> Again: LMAO!</li>
            <li> fair price for a good shaver</li>
            <li> admit this product worked surprisingly well.  </li>
            <li> Yup - the battery is even included; always a good way to score bonus points with me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But perhaps with good running start and a catapult....</li>
            <li> The pressure is always a perfect, light touch, gliding across my face.</li>
            <li> Coated Blades - apparently it&#x27;s a good thing</li>
            <li> Coated Blades - apparently it&#x27;s a good thing</li>
            <li> Works great nice close shave .</li>
            <li> I did surprisingly like the &#x27;power&#x27; feature though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be fair, this razor provided a good shave for me.</li>
            <li> I got this razor since it seemed like a good idea, a razor that vibrates.</li>
            <li> My shaving experience is not as good either.</li>
            <li> Probably the best razor available in the market.</li>
            <li> We received a battery-powered (battery included) vibrating razor with a blade good for sensitive-skin.</li>
            <li> surprisingly good version of the venerable Mach3 setup and</li>
            <li> This razor is very comfortable to the hand and gives a great shave.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> works great, really satisfied with the price and durability.</li>
            <li> I love this thing!</li>
            <li> So pleased!</li>
            <li> I can almost guarantee that you will love it!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using an electric safety razor, and I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
            <li> Best price ever found happy saving days ever since better new design</li>
            <li> Nice product</li>
            <li> Nice to see you again.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, sometimes cheaper really IS as good as spending more.</li>
            <li> But to each his own...</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, sometimes cheaper really IS as good as spending more.</li>
            <li> But to each his own...</li>
            <li> Loving it.</li>
            <li> The vibration does seem to cut my hair better, but it works well without the vibration, which is good if that battery dies.</li>
            <li> Yes, it did make it feel kind of nice</li>
            <li> The style is good, easy to grip.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Mach 3 razors for years; they&#x27;re the most effective and longest-lasting disposable razors on the market.</li>
            <li> Good smooth shave although has caused nicks.</li>
            <li> Still best shave for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Very smooth, no cuts.  </li>
            <li> Cost effective, efficient, easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light and gives a nice smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using Gillette razors for a while now, so I thought I&#x27;d give this a chance, but when compared to the razor with more blades and a sideburn precision trimmer (profusion)</li>
            <li> all I got was more scratches with this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is better than any of newer models with out vibration models.</li>
            <li> Love these razors.</li>
            <li> That cost Gillette the top star.</li>
            <li> I love this razor.</li>
            <li> I wondered why I would want my razor to vibrate, but once you try it you will love it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why the vibration should be anything more than a gimmick, but it seems to work.</li>
            <li> my favorite razor.</li>
            <li> Nice, smooth shaving with this.</li>
            <li> but the pulsations make the shave so much better</li>
            <li> he used to be me, when I had more spring in my step.</li>
            <li> Nice n smooth...</li>
            <li> I love this razor.  </li>
            <li> Been shaving 59 years, mostly wet-shaving with d/e blades.</li>
            <li> Although this product looks interesting, it works</li>
            <li> /&gt;While this razor might be okay for a lady to shave her legs, (and I wouldn&#x27;t swear to that), I found it to be lacking for shaving one&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> Each cartridge has 3 advance coating blades for a better shave.</li>
            <li> Perfect grip, overall weight is just right&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Before blaming the razor for any shortcomings, be sure its not your preparation before shaving that&#x27;s at fault.  </li>
            <li> A nice and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I am sure the numbr of blades help with that too.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver, I have been using the Mach3 since they came out.</li>
            <li> The blades are dirt cheap!</li>
            <li> This latest iteration has built in motorized vibrations to help with blade to skin contact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s important for me to have a shaver that does a good, smooth job and protects me from myself.</li>
            <li> This one seems to do a better job and prevent that, allowing more uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> process is so smooth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been pleased with the Mach 3  blades.</li>
            <li> I was glad to be able to use my existing blades.</li>
            <li> Prefer the Fusion slightly more, but this is lower cost per shave.</li>
            <li> While that works better than running water from the front, it doesn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li> nothing fancy, nothing great, just a decent razor.  </li>
            <li> I have tried most types (including safety razors) and brand, including most Gilette models and, for some reason, this gives me the most comfortable shave of all.</li>
            <li> Very happy it lasted as long as it did.</li>
            <li> And, regardless of the effect of that feature, the shaver itself is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used in a long life of dreaded shaves.</li>
            <li> + Vibration helps move it across skin a bit more easily</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all kinds of &#x27;breakthrough&#x27; blades for sensitive skin, but they honestly didn&#x27;t work as good as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> quite a large amount, surprisingly.</li>
            <li> this more clean appealing color&lt;br /&gt;Luis</li>
            <li> It remains the best of any major razor brand that I&#x27;ve used but still looking for a closer, more consistent shave.</li>
            <li> far I&#x27;m happy with this Gillette.  </li>
            <li> instead of a shave gel or a non-aerosol shave cream, I got a great shave on my 60+ year old face.</li>
            <li> They work a lot better than most electrics, have pretty good blade life, and a more reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> The market for razors that work best with sensitive skin has an exceptionally capable solution.  </li>
            <li> &gt; Easy to Rinse</li>
            <li> ;oD/&gt;&gt; Easy to Rinse</li>
            <li> It has a great feel in the hand and the grips are better than those on the standard Mach3 handles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To begin with, installing the included battery is easy.  </li>
            <li> I liked it very much.</li>
            <li> Pretty nice.  </li>
            <li> But the Mach3 is hands down the best shave I have had to date.  </li>
            <li> Then purchased the Gillette Mach 3 Sensitive Power Razor and what a pleasant difference.  </li>
            <li> This is a very good product but be sure to have the power off when shaving tight spots or the razor can cut into your skin.</li>
            <li> It glides so smoothly and doesn&#x27;t even irritate my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed at the results everyday.</li>
            <li> more of a gimmick rather than a useful product.</li>
            <li> It was so cheaply made that it made me wonder if this unit was either</li>
            <li> I shave everyday and this is the best razor I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The blades are still available here and there, but the M3 Power razor was discontinued.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;+ Easy to clean under running tap</li>
            <li> She said that she doesn&#x27;t have that information available which is why I question the accuracy of the information I got on the phone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than that, this is a great razor and is similar to the Fusion I use every day.</li>
            <li> However sometimes it doesn&#x27;t do the greatest job on a couple nooks and crannies on my face, but I&#x27;ve yet to try a razor that didn&#x27;t have trouble with those spots.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s highly recommended for buyers who are looking for an easy, comfortable, effective shave without dropping a lot of money on an electric razor.</li>
            <li> I originally thought that the vibration feature was a gimmick</li>
            <li> I needed another but could not find the original on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> top of all this, the replacement cartridges are, apparently, pretty expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However I&#x27;m very pleased with it so far.</li>
            <li> I had the original turbo when it came out but after years of abuse it broke.</li>
            <li> Best shave for sensitive skin, the vibration is in my opinion the key.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t think it shaves any better than the regular Mach3 did.</li>
            <li> then that I would pick a razor with a better cut, I think it&#x27;s because it only has 3 blades it doesn&#x27;t get too close of a cut still nice to have</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they put a lot of effort into making the glide strip better for sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Mach 3 for a long time and this is a very nice upgrade from that razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another concern is what is the best way to clean the cartridge without causing it to get dull as a result?</li>
            <li> there are too many blades (5) that causes the shaving head to be too large.  </li>
            <li> Nothing special.  </li>
            <li> Mach3 Sensitive is amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a good razor, but the vibration is just a gimmick, I went back to my profusion, and I think I&#x27;ll stay with</li>
            <li> FULL DISCLOSURE:</li>
            <li> Refill cartridges are reasonably priced, and it&#x27;s a worthwhile investment if you suffer from irritation after shaving.</li>
            <li> Cool Stuff:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cool</li>
            <li> Cool</li>
            <li> The problem is, it absolutely doesn&#x27;t create a better shave.  </li>
            <li> using a handle with good weight (like the metal Mach3 or Mach3 Turbo handle) is a key part of the shaving process.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, as a stand-alone product, this razor is still good enough to be called a Gillette.  </li>
            <li> The Mach 3 regular power razor and blades are just as good.</li>
            <li> It adds just a little something that makes shaving even easier and more pleasant.</li>
            <li> I have an electric razor, but I use the Mach 3 Sensitive Power more because it&#x27;s so easy and because it works so well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Personally I feel they are better in almost every respect than most all others on the market--or</li>
            <li> but I quickly became accustomed to the vibrations.  </li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> blade will get ruined quickly.  </li>
            <li> Super close shave without the nicks and cuts.  </li>
            <li> A nice blade shave just feels better than any other.</li>
            <li> I suppose there may be something newer and better and lots more expensive out there, but i&#x27;m happy with the Mach III line and the powered wands.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But the bottom line is going to be how long the cartridge lasts, &amp; whether the razor is a good value as a result.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and could not shave more that once or twice a week without problems.</li>
            <li> I am blonde and do not have very course or thick hair, but if Mach3 in general works perfectly for my legs and perfectly for my husband&#x27;s course facial hair, seems like it is a sure bet for everyone.  </li>
            <li> I could shave with only water or very light soap, the blade is that gentle but still provides a top notch shave.  </li>
            <li> I own several styles of Fusion Mach5 blade shaving units from Gillette.  </li>
            <li> It actually feels nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun to have a baby face again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun to have a baby face again.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Mach 3 razor remains my favorite razor, having served me well for nearly a decade.</li>
            <li> So far I think I like the non-power model better.</li>
            <li> So, you maybe able to save some dough just buying the old blades if you don&#x27;t care about color matching.  </li>
            <li> It works okay, but a normal Mach 3 gets you a much closer shave!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth</li>
            <li> Nice solid shave.</li>
            <li> This one seems lighter and more plasticky than the older model I still have, which feels more solid and still works after 10+ years.</li>
            <li> Basically I would consider the razor to be a good value if I get at least a month out of a [[ASIN:B00AFCOUXG cartridge at today&#x27;s pricing;]] preferably more like 2 months.</li>
            <li> As it is, it&#x27;s right where I grip when I use this unit</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of blades &#x3D; 3.</li>
            <li> First... I ain&#x27;t most men, and basically every shaver cuts me, so I have to be discretionary with a vengeance, as I bleed easily, and flow long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth enough so that it doesn&#x27;t hurt to go over the various ridges on your face, and effective enough so that when you get done, you find that you&#x27;ve got a nice, clean look going.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad razor, but I really don&#x27;t see what the electric motor is supposed to do -</li>
            <li> I usually keep a beard to help curb flair-ups, but still like to have a good, clean shave from time to time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First the good: This is the closest shave I have ever had from a powered razor, hands down.</li>
            <li> Right now I am just trimming of beard, but it&#x27;s very nice to have that little vibration as I trim very intricate parts of my face.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve found significantly great shaves using everything from lesser brand name razors (Schick Hydro 5) to essentially generic brands you can get for 75% cheaper</li>
            <li> It does this in all the places which are easy to get to but in those troublesome curves, I ended up having to use my old stand-by disposable razor to finish</li>
            <li> The Mach3 Sensitive is a good razor, I don&#x27;t see where it was necessary to discontinue the M3 Power and release a near-identical razor with higher priced blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far, I have not found that it improves the shaving experience, which is already pretty good with a standard Mach 3 razor.</li>
            <li> I like it very much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad Gillette brought these razors back.</li>
            <li> I had the first model in the market still works</li>
            <li> Have been using same razor for many years until it broke.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Who is that sweet, smooth baby face staring back at me in the mirror?</li>
            <li> I saw this Mach3 Sensitive was available, and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always preferred the styling of a Gillette to pretty much everything else if the truth be told, but does it really shave better for those of us guys with sensitive skin?</li>
            <li> My first one lasted 8 years.</li>
            <li> I guess this is my 3rd or 4th one in maybe 10 years or more?</li>
            <li> I will give the power unit more uses, but because I think the blades of the non-power unit blades last longer for me</li>
            <li> Not useless on course beard hair like 4 blades are.</li>
            <li> Not only have the prices of the disposable cartridges gone up through the roof, there are better options out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Mach 3 in various forms since its introduction more than a decade ago.  </li>
            <li> Battery life seems ok, about three weeks if used daily.</li>
            <li> The difference between a regular one and a power one is striking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with Schick ST2 disposables and Extreme3 Disposables since they&#x27;re better than anything Gillette has made in the last 25 years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just used to first shaves being harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love these razors and especially the feature of shaving with vibrator</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will openly admit that like many others, this economy has had a severe impact on my entire life &amp; lifestyle, &amp; these days I approach many of these reviews as not only based on quality but more so on a price to quality</li>
            <li> the not so good:&lt;br /&gt;During my first shave</li>
            <li> Still a very solid razor I&#x27;ve used for years when I need my face to be super smooth.  </li>
            <li> The most important thing to note about this razor is that it was previously sold as the Gillette M3 Power, which has been on the market for years.</li>
            <li> At the end of the day I&#x27;m going to look around my local stores for the old original style mach 3 which is heavier and feels more durable.</li>
            <li> I liked the head pivot, the lubrication strip was good for my sensitive skin, and the little motor made it easier to get through my neck &amp; facial stubble without feeling like it was being yanked out with a pair of pliers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I personally got this for my Dad and he really likes this product and will order more.</li>
            <li> (average is $0.15/blade if you buy a 100 pack), and the shave is better quality with less irritation, even though there is a learning curve and technique is more important, well worth the switch.</li>
            <li> I know many people probably keep their razors for more than three uses ($$$), but after the third use with a regular mach 3, it is very rough on my skin and leaves me with more rashes.  </li>
            <li> She told me pretty much that there are 2 part numbers with every Gillette product, one that comes with a case and one that does not.  </li>
            <li> It shaves pretty well, much closer/smoother than any electric I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly sure what the gain is with this shaver that one gets by activating the battery-operated electric function, but the humming buzz feels good on my face when that&#x27;s going.</li>
            <li> /&gt;What&#x27;s more, I have been an off-and-on fan of wet shaving, and  of course, every first shave with a new DE -- no matter how mild -- results in nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li> The handle portion is very light and feels pretty cheaply made, I feel like it would break if I gripped it too hard.  </li>
            <li> The vibration does nothing but make a less effective shave.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> the Mach 3 Fusion Power and Mach 3 Sensitive Power razors are the same design and the blades are only slightly different, I&#x27;ll just stick with the Gillette Mach 3 Fusion Power, which has always given me a great close comfortable shave for years.</li>
            <li> overall happy with product but often it will break if the suction holder that I use in the shower falls down.  </li>
            <li> At first I wondered why Gillette was trying to continue the Mach3 brand seeing as it was several years old already and has seen better days, but I jumped in and ordered mine anyway.</li>
            <li> I tried the Gillette Mach3 Sensitive Power Razor and have to say it proves a good, long lasting shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my fourth use with this blade and it still feels fine.  </li>
            <li> First, the next paragraph is what I originally wrote 2 days after receipt of the razor on 3/7/13:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Would rate higher if I cared for the main selling point of this model, the &amp;#34;power&amp;#34;/vibrate feature.</li>
            <li> This is a very highly recommended razor.</li>
            <li> Perhaps Gillette spoiled us with their other products, but this particular item is decent, nothing spectacular</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very soft and nice but other</li>
            <li> They are $14 each at my drug store and they are much cheaper on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy the power one over the regular one.</li>
            <li> Too much blood loss.  </li>
            <li> The vibrating feature really helps get a close shave and causes a decrease in irritation which really helps.</li>
            <li> Has Gillette quality really descended to this level of cheapness?  </li>
            <li> Some of them are really terrible.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When did disposable blades become modern tech?  </li>
            <li> I forgot how much technology has changed from 3 blade to 4 blade.</li>
            <li> The power feature really gives a closer shave under the arms.</li>
            <li> but it really does help.  </li>
            <li> So, thanks for making this razor.</li>
            <li> It feels very unforgiving.  </li>
            <li> Because the razor vibrates, you don&#x27;t need to use any real pressure to get a very close shave.</li>
            <li> a guess really.</li>
            <li> Not irritating on skin like 2 blade razors are.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t really see the point of the battery-operated vibration.  </li>
            <li> I found that it works quite well though the sensation is unusual.  </li>
            <li> Instead of feeling ripped out of my skin, their really isn&#x27;t any feeling as they are cut</li>
            <li> This razor is definitely worth a shot if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Much easier to use</li>
            <li> but did it really improve the shave?  </li>
            <li> Really?  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of the Mach3 line since they came out, but went a bit cheap in the last 6 months by picking up a set of Mangum 5 razors and replacement heads that were one sale at Costco.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Trying out the Mach3 Sensitive on some areas that were prone to redness and sensitivity after shaving didn&#x27;t show any useful result.  </li>
            <li> Disposable Gillete&#x27;s are much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Really?????  </li>
            <li> I love that it vibrates, which actually helps me avoid razor burn since I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> , wich STILL offers a shave just as good as the most expensive ProGlide razor promises.</li>
            <li> , wich STILL offers a shave just as good as the most expensive ProGlide razor promises.</li>
            <li> I would have added more rubber to the handle to make it easier to hold and the other being changing the placement of the power button.</li>
            <li> I will not purchase anything else, still don&#x27;t care for more than 3 blades and whatever other fancy shenanigans are out there.</li>
            <li> This razor works well, but not any better than other good-quality razors on the market.  </li>
            <li> back to the original 3/7/13 review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I cite as a good alternative example, the Schick Hydro 5 razor (although in the last several months I&#x27;ve noticed the prices on that razor have gone up considerably), and a few Bic disposable 4 bladed razors work exceptionally well, especially when factoring in price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;And finally some even better news: regular blue Venus cartridges fit this razor and snap on without any problems -</li>
            <li> My husband likes his new razor but forgets to turn it on because he really cant tell much difference with vibrate on or off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In total, it&#x27;s not a bad razor.  </li>
            <li> The expense of the cartridges is why I&#x27;ve knocked off a star, but I&#x27;m sure the price will eventually come down.</li>
            <li> will but again.&lt;br /&gt;saved more than half than buying it at the supermarket.</li>
            <li> Less than a month, I&#x27;m financially better off using premium hand razors.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bought to replace older Mach 3 vibrator handle that gave out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was a relief to find that this razor handle fit the old, regular Mach3 blades I found stashed away while cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I had an older Mach 3 that I&#x27;ve had for years.  </li>
            <li> I had one of the older styles for 10 years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent razor, with plenty of blades and a swivel head</li>
            <li> The main difference is, in all honesty, that this is a cheaper version of the Fusion.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- Fits decently well in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> very fair, sensitive skin, reddish blonde hair and my skin is covered with lots of little bumps and birth marks - only vibrating shavers</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s a great little shaver.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t really judge this razor until I see how long the cartridge lasts, &amp; as we&#x27;re requested to get these reviews up quickly, please consider this a place holder.</li>
            <li> Been shaving with Mach 3 for years and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> and I recommend getting it if the cost isn&#x27;t too high</li>
            <li> Love this little razor.</li>
            <li> And it delivered on being a great size to handle all the contours and difficult spots on the neck and under the chin</li>
            <li> On rare occasion, irritation would make itself present when exceeding a blade count of three.  </li>
            <li> Replaceable Blade Cartridges - obvious but still worth saying&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Replaceable Blade Cartridges - obvious but still worth saying&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed this with subsequent shaves, but thought it was worth noting all the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pair that with the normal Mach 3</li>
            <li> The button that turns on the vibrations is conveniently placed where I normally apply pressure with my thumb, and while it hasn&#x27;t happened often, I have accidentally turned off the vibrating feature.  </li>
            <li> Vibration helps clean shave in a single sweep</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this product is ok but doesn&#x27;t leave my skin much less irritated/red than my Fusion.  </li>
            <li> I bought this new razor for my husband to replace his Mach3 Turbo.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simply a new name and a new paint job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the last several months, I have discovered a generic brand 5-bladed razor that you can purchase at Kroger which looks suspiciously like the Gillette ProGlide (but the razors are not compatible with the other handles in case you were wondering), also I found a 6-bladed model at Walgreens which gives a great shave as well...</li>
            <li> I have an obscure skin disorder called Porphyria, which basically means I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> To get a close shave on very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> This version offers vibrations for added &amp;#34;comfort&amp;#34; and less &amp;#34;irritation.&amp;#34; The vibrations don&#x27;t really add much to my shaving experience, but the razors are sharp and last a fair amount of time before needing to be replaced.  </li>
            <li> Wow !</li>
            <li> Everything else felt exactly the same...</li>
            <li> stay on the Power Sensitive handle at all!).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit jarring at first, especially in the mornings.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the vibration actually makes the shave gentler or it just changes the amount of pressure I apply intuitively, but this has given me a nick-free shave on the FIRST shave.  </li>
            <li> sensitive skin shaving cream is more like a creamy oil &amp; a little goes a longgg way!</li>
            <li> but this is about Gillette&#x27;s new Mach3 Sensitive razor.</li>
            <li> new Power Sensitive handle</li>
            <li> is my first time using a Mach 3 with the vibrating action, and it makes a BIG difference.</li>
            <li> I first saw a dynamic safety razor nearly 50 years ago.</li>
            <li> at least that WAS my opinion before I tried several different brands which offered me a great, smooth shave without the stupidly high prices that usually accompany Gillette products.</li>
            <li> This is a very soft comfortable razor, I wish it would cut a little closer</li>
            <li> Not true that \\&quot;all Mach 3 cartridges fit on all Mach 3 razors/handles.\\</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, my old Mach 3 Turbo blades are exactly the same except for the color.</li>
            <li> He Is blind and this easily gives him a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The old MP3 power blades are still available (at the time this review is being written) and the cost of the M3 Power blades are less than the cost of the Mach3 Sensitive blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The handle itself is plastic which I found to be a little too light --</li>
            <li> close accurate minimal lacerating shaver with low entry fee.</li>
            <li> the vibration action doesn&#x27;t do anything noticeable -</li>
            <li> but Is so old that I had the need for</li>
            <li> sensitive shave gel</li>
            <li> Having sensitive skin, this stops irritation almost completely for me.</li>
            <li> but the shave was neither sensitive or close.</li>
            <li> In fact I found myself going over it again with an old Gillette just to get the shave I was expecting.</li>
            <li> He also says the sensitive blade is soothing.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it for sensitive skin like his.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even used to do straight razor shaves, when I was younger and my skin could still handle it, and had a steadier hand.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s kinda cute, or at least that&#x27;s what my hubby says.</li>
            <li> &gt; 10 Soft Elastomeric Microfins - who-da-whudda?</li>

            <li> B00AFCP6W0 Gillette Mach3 Sensitive Power Cartridges -- 10 Count]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> would not waste my time on this product.  </li>
            <li> It basically allows me to get the same level of shaving effectiveness without having to apply any real pressure to the shaver.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the Mach 3 Sensitive razor.</li>
            <li> There is no difference between the handle or blades of Mach3 Sensitive Power and M3 Power.</li>
            <li> The power vibration was a bit strange when I first used it</li>
            <li> This time I bought the sensitive razor and cartridge.</li>
            <li> so introduced the Mach 3 Sensitive Razor.  </li>
            <li> Works just like the old one.</li>
            <li> The vibration action helps the razor glide along skin and also helps rinse clear the blades when rinsing in water.</li>
            <li> I really just wanted a Mach3 shaver in a color different than my husband&#x27;s, so that&#x27;s why I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> real question is how does it perform against the regular, non vibrating models?</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can use all the Mach 3 blades for this Sensitive model.  </li>
            <li> Sensitive version is lighter than the Fusion version.  </li>
            <li> This motorized version makes it possible to get a close shave while preventing one from exerting too much pressure.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and often develop a rash on my neck when shaving.  </li>
            <li> This sensitive power razor seems like just the ticket!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> far I haven&#x27;t had any rash on my neck while using this.  </li>
            <li> Just get the Neutrogena Sensitive Skin Shaving Cream instead :</li>
            <li> Replacements are around $20 for 8, so that&#x27;s nearly 3 months for me</li>
            <li> But this Power Mach3 Sensitive is persuading me otherwise.  </li>
            <li> this Mach3 was like the difference between night and day, a much smoother shave without needing to go cover the same spot multipe</li>
            <li> at least 3 more shaves after that&#x27;s turned</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, the vibrations are supposedly beneficial for people with sensitive skin, which I have.  </li>
            <li> One thing I found quite helpful in one of the reviews was a the statement, \\&quot;Do not be fooled by the changing of the green or blue strip at the top of the cartridge: I&#x27;ve found that I can get</li>
            <li> + The green strip for sensitive skin really works - it feels much better than any other shaver I had before&lt;</li>
            <li> The shave is more gentle and has less possibility of cut even when I moved the razor a little faster by accident.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember when this last happened, even with Fusion razors or older cartridge</li>
            <li> Based on the thoroughness of a couple of the other reviews, I have to assume that either those reviewers received different packaging than I did, or were extremely familiar with this razor line already.</li>
            <li> When used in that particular area, the vibrations actually make the blades pull my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have to use repetitive, short strokes up my neck just to remove most of it just to have some stubble remain and no close shave.</li>
            <li> I was wondering why they stopped producing the Mach 3 Power back then when I was looking for a new razor handle as my old one died after 3 years of use.</li>
            <li> Gillette&#x27;s new Mach 3 Sensitive Power Razor is not much different from their Mach 3 Fusion Power Razor.</li>
            <li> If you never tried a \\&quot;power\\&quot; razor, feel free to try one with a tiny caveat that you will slightly overpay for your trial and error.  </li>
            <li> So over the decades, remembering Remington as one that was mild... Minimal white collar tragedies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing that it means that either the Mach3 Sensitive does nothing for my skin that another Mach3 can&#x27;t, but perhaps my skin isn&#x27;t sensitive enough to need a sensitive razor like this one.</li>
            <li> The vibration appears to provide no real benefit, it&#x27;s made of pretty flimsy feeling plastic, and otherwise is just unimpressive.</li>
            <li> Tried it twice and went back to the normal Mach3.</li>
            <li> Little did we know that the vibration would produce such a close smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Very worth the small up front expense.</li>
            <li> Perhaps Gillett will introduce a new model later</li>
            <li> Part of the issue is there are numerous languages on the package; &amp; as such there isn&#x27;t room to say much of anything in any of them!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works pretty well on my legs too, but I have to go pretty slow for fear of nicking.</li>
            <li> My prior experience with the power Mach 3 (which broke at the handle after 5 years or so where the battery cover is located due to my habit of banging it on the sink edge while shaving to remove hair and cream debris which I have learned not to do anymore) was almost an enjoyable experience if that is possible and the Fusion blades are even more expensive, so I began looking for this.</li>
            <li> do not cause major</li>
            <li> I have very thick facial hair and the razor left my face feeling smooth and with a shave that would last a full day.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure, but vibration may help clean the blade.</li>
            <li> I had the original a few years back.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do anything special for my face and is kind of annoying.  </li>
            <li> Batteries seem to last a long time and they really give a closer, smoother shave than the non-powered models.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure if the vibration feature really makes all that much of a difference.</li>
            <li> Apparently, some of the blades had been stocked up and then the razor mistakenly thrown away.  </li>
            <li> I DID notice, however after my first shave--which I found to be very comfortable--that I had a larger number of areas where I was bleeding than usual...</li>
            <li> but it feels like it has the same weight as the old Mach 3/Turbo with the battery inside.  </li>
            <li> The Sensitive Power razor is basically the same design as the Fusion Power razor with it&#x27;s battery operated vibrating blades, and the only noticeable difference is the blades seam a bit sharper on the Sensitive Power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since</li>
            <li> I recently purchased replacement blades, and hubby requested the Mach3 Sensitive blades.</li>
            <li> &quot; That apparently is when Gillette suggests changing the blade, &amp; mine came with nothing stating that.</li>
            <li> idea behind this razor is that it vibrates, which is supposed to create a better shave.  </li>
            <li> The vibration occurs at a much higher frequency and you don&#x27;t have the problem of it slowing down because you don&#x27;t need to rewind it.</li>
            <li> Fusion&#x27;s blades are too close together and hard to clean.</li>
            <li> And the blade has stayed sharp MUCH longer than the cheapie</li>
            <li> He gets a very close shave with this razor which I guess he says is partly due to</li>
            <li> While I new what to expect from prior experience with the standard Mach 3, this razor actually exceeded those expectations.  </li>
            <li> Actually, nor do the M3 Power blades, if you pull on them a bit (but they do fit somewhat, at least, whereas the Mach 3 Turbo blades do not fit/</li>
            <li> Personally I find no difference in effect when using, but a big difference in price when purchasing \\&quot;sensitive mach 3\\&quot; vs, mach 3.</li>
            <li> Starting with the regular Mach 3, then Mach 3 Turbo, and now Mach 3 Sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly certain we moved on the the &amp;#34;mach 3 standard&amp;#34; for currency back in the 90s, given the extreme cost of the replacement blades.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s fine when I&#x27;m shaving my neck and cheeks, but it does a terrible job on my chin and isn&#x27;t good at all when used between my nose and upper lip.&lt;br</li>
            <li> in fact, it makes it less comfortable as it&#x27;s more difficult to hold on to with wet hands while the thing is vibrating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had sensitive skin for as long as I remember.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time Fusion power user and thought maybe this sensitive would be comparable, it wasn&#x27;t even close.  </li>
            <li> The shave is what you would expect from any other mach 3, the super lubricated mega strip or whatever they call it these days feels the same as my other mach 3 blades.  </li>
            <li> I found turning it off, and just using the razor was a much closer shave, with less areas that need to touched</li>
            <li> My skin is too sensitive to use this for a dry shave.</li>
            <li> Now, the seedy corners of my mind want me to delve into an area of shaving certain body parts wherein vibrations would be very, um, exciting, but I&#x27;m going to refrain from such sophomoric desires and attempt to take a serious shot at reviewing this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> + Blades last long, even despite the &#x27;cooling strip&#x27; wearing down first</li>
            <li> Wet shaving with gel is like a dream, and dry shaving is completely painless and almost completely effortless.</li>
            <li> In other words, ONLY the Mach 3 Sensitive Power blades in particular stay firmly attached (even with pulling/tugging) on the Mach 3 Power Sensitive handle.  </li>
            <li> i highly recommend for men who have been shaving for less than 20 years</li>
            <li> Ironically, all of the shavers made for women (I am a female), usually leave me with a cut or two unless I am super careful.  </li>
            <li> She has major back issues that left her with partial nerve damage in one of her legs.  </li>
            <li> :  at rate of one cartridge per week, at 3$ usd per cartridge is a little high at 150$ usd per year.  </li>
            <li> I got this such a long time ago, and I use it a couple of times a week, and it still runs on same battery!  </li>
            <li> They also refuse to state how long a cartridge is likely to last; they don&#x27;t even give a range.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Purchased the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor first and did not like it because it was bulky, fat, and hard to maneuver around my lips and under my nose area...  </li>
            <li> I can shave long or short stubble and the vibration keeps the blade from giving me razor burn.</li>
            <li> The extra price for the green lubricating strip next to the blades vs. the blue of regular blades is just extra price, unless you believe the color difference has extra lubrication properties as the manufacturer claims of course.</li>
            <li> The shave is noticeably smoother with far less irritation and no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> but I get about an entire month out of a single blade.</li>
            <li> I guess they had to make the handle larger to accommodate the single AAA battery that&#x27;s included.</li>
            <li> Very thin plastic and a cheap switch that will likely break.  </li>
            <li> I also prefer this over other more expensive Gilette models with 4 or 5 blades.</li>
            <li> If three blades aren&#x27;t cutting it, two more won&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> but I wonder how long it will run before water gets into the battery compartment.</li>
            <li> I used the M3 Power razor for a long time.</li>
            <li> But it wasn&#x27;t long before I realized this razor wasn&#x27;t an improvement from the M3 Power...</li>
            <li> the M3&#x27;s lubrication strip was orange, whereas the strip on the Mach3 Sensitive was green.</li>
            <li> ...for as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I&#x27;m a fan and will keep using these for as long as I can...</li>
            <li> I promised I would update this review once I learned how long the cartridges lasted, so here we go.</li>
            <li> paid $3.77 for this unit but it is so poorly made that it is not even worth $2.  </li>
            <li> one cleans easy, only has 3 razors, and cuts close without cutting too close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Apparently the Gillette Mach3 is a rehash of a previous vibrating Gillette razor and</li>
            <li> I did find that 2-day long whiskers shave off with much less pain due to the motor action.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smoother than it&#x27;s ever been with any other razor, electric or regular, and in a fraction of the time.</li>
            <li> only difference I could find (other than the silver/white razor color) was the color of the strips -</li>
            <li> I used other \\&quot;power\\&quot; razors years back and wanted to see if any improvement has been made over the years and the answer is....</li>
            <li> I have already ordered a second one of this item and will now simply glide my thumb down the blades (carefully) to remove debris while under running water rather than slamming it on the sink edge.</li>
            <li> just dry it off after each shave and keep it dry.</li>
            <li> The Green and White color combo reminds me of the Hulk ride at Universal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also concerns me that there will be millions of batteries containing toxic waste to be disposed of when we can simply use a regular razor.  </li>
            <li> I also personally stocked up on the disposable&#x27;s about a year ago when a local chain store did a 3 packages for 1 sale; &amp; I still have quite a few left.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a few days of irritation flare ups, I switched back to using my Schick Hydro 5 and am currently tampering with the Gillette Fusion and a bottle of the Gillette Foam with Menthol.</li>
            <li> Like I Can Jump Buildings in a Single Bound!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ok, maybe not in a single bound.</li>
            <li> Gillette comes with a battery and a single razor head to get you started.  </li>
            <li> I may use the old toothbrush method, but at this price a small instruction manual should have been included.</li>
            <li> I have wanted one of these for a long time and finally spent the cash and bought it.</li>
            <li> While it visually flows with the design of the handle, its position makes it prone to being accidentally pressed when holding the razor at a slightly odd angle.  </li>
            <li> but the battery usually lasts a few months depending on how much you shave.</li>
            <li> With two extra days of growth, this razor still gave me an unbelievably close shave without any extra effort.</li>
            <li> After shaving and rinsing, apply rubbing alcohol to the razor blades and just let dry in an empty cup.  </li>
            <li> she can&#x27;t really feel a normal razor and ends up cutting herself.  </li>
            <li> Blades last me about a week and a half before I change them out.  </li>
            <li> That did not happen today on my second shave, where I started with much less beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s annoying to have buy those particular, separate blades- M3 Sensitive blades only- for the M3 Power Sensitive handle.</li>
            <li> face it, if I could afford to, I would more than likely use nothing BUT Gillette products...however, my sad, little budget keeps me a few notches down</li>
            <li> &quot;  Contrary to this product claim, it is NOT true that all Mach 3 razor blades work/fit firmly on the M3 Power Sensitive handle.  </li>
            <li> I dry shave a lot (due in part to the fact that I don&#x27;t grow a heavy beard, and in part to the fact that sometimes I let the beard grow in and only need to &#x27;touch up&#x27; my neck and cheeks), and the Mach 3 works without causing any discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t buy the razor at least try the sensitive cartridge.</li>
            <li> Careful, you screw up once, you pay 3 times.  </li>
            <li> Minimal cuts.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really a fan of the handle.</li>
            <li> Not much lather, but a lot of moist lubrication.  </li>
            <li> Minus 2 for unhelpful response from Gillette rep.  </li>
            <li> However, the battery cover started slipping repeatedly.</li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t use this to shave my head bald, because I think it dulls my razors quicker that way.</li>
            <li> so really it&#x27;s not that</li>
            <li> Not for political reasons, but due to the lack of oversight in China of unhealthy substances that have all too frequently been found in consumer products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He has sensitive skin so this causes less irritation than other razors he has used in the past.</li>
            <li> You figure out the other uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tossed the battery in with my other batteries, didn&#x27;t need any of the &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; features advertised, just needed a Mach3 compatible handle.  </li>
            <li> only had two small issues that I would have changed it I had designed it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;+ Blades replaceable with any other Mach3 blade cartridges</li>
            <li> If your claim to fame is your other razor is a POS</li>
            <li> and so this razor competes well against your other product...just quit already.  </li>
            <li> I have bought Harry&#x27;s razors and thought I would give this a try due to the wirecutter review.  </li>
            <li> I will update when I learn how long the (not cheap) cartridge lasts.</li>
            <li> I also haven&#x27;t had the problems with the battery cover flying off that other reviewers have reported.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I have to be very careful about the products and methods I use to shave with.</li>
            <li> Certainly not on my face but ELSEWHERE!</li>
            <li> Also compared to other razors the refill cartridges are average price.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;d recently started using the regular Mach 3 and liked it, so I thought at the worst, I&#x27;d end up a little wiser and with a back-up razor but no better shave.</li>
            <li> In my half-awake state I have been known to slice my skin open with my unpowered Mach3 by pressing it too hard.</li>
            <li> When it arrived, I was shocked at the cheap construction.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Furthermore, the vibrations made it slightly difficult to shave straight.  </li>
            <li> Minus 1 for missing case.  </li>
            <li> Gillette is getting things down as I am tossing Schick Quatros I have.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Right now razor is sitting in a drawer blade down.  </li>
            <li> It does indeed help cut down on the nicks.</li>
            <li> : (a) intended for the extremely cost-sensitive emerging markets, or perhaps (b) a cheaply made counterfeit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> my hand feels numb, which isn&#x27;t exactly what I want when I have a razor sharp blade pressed against my face.</li>
            <li> Much less expensive than the Fusion Blades and any other new ones.</li>
            <li> I tried doing a half of my face with it and a half with the profusion -</li>
            <li> The vibration helps create a close shave with less chance of a nick or cut.  </li>
            <li> I am always amazed that the vibrating feature makes the shave less irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fatter and about half inch longer</li>
            <li> I typically discard my Mach3 razors after three uses.  </li>
            <li> With the vibrate feature on this razor, she can feel what she&#x27;s doing and has less issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I shaved half my face with vibrating feature and half without and there was no difference.</li>
            <li> I use this to shave my head, and there are a few places that have always been difficult, particularly around the nape of my neck.</li>
            <li> being said, I did purchase and use this razor under its new name but was not particularly impressed.</li>
            <li> I do not have any investment in Gillette, nor family, but a friend gave me this little gem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking for a response from P&amp;G about how to get a case that I&#x27;ve gotten with every other Gillette razor that I&#x27;ve purchased over the past 30 years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is hard to decide if you are pushing hard enough or not when shaving.  </li>
            <li> I didnt want to us a five blade regularly and the standard 2 and 3 blades werent cutting it</li>
            <li> It broke after a few years use.</li>
            <li> Waste of $10.</li>
            <li> Saved me a bundle, as there were a lot of blades that would have gone to waste.  </li>
            <li> A few electric razors.</li>
            <li> One size(or in this case vibration) does not fit all.  </li>
            <li> Now I only have to buy one type of refill cartridge and we aren&#x27;t getting our shavers confused.</li>
            <li> and it took a few days to get used to it.</li>
            <li> The vibration from the battery seems a bit gimmicky to me.  </li>
            <li> the trouble spot has become my soul problem.</li>
            <li> If I can get used to the odd sensation when shaving, I&#x27;ll be even happier!  </li>
            <li> Blades from other types are not interchangeable, so if you are not impressed, you cannot switch to regular blades and will have to pass it on to a friend of yours to see if it works for them.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I hate shaving (but don&#x27;t want facial hair either, so it&#x27;s a necessary evil) and am prone to giving myself cuts by rushing through the job, so</li>
            <li> I usually buy some cheapie brand from Target.  </li>
            <li> I just called 1-800-GILLETTE and am not satisfied with the response that I got.</li>
            <li> the blade lasts longer than usual for me.  </li>
            <li> I mean, compared to the Magnums I&#x27;d been using there was a definate difference, as in there was little or no redness or sensitivity with the Mach3</li>
            <li> This blade is horrible and I can&#x27;t believe that it was rated better than Harry&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> In fact, it makes it a bit difficult to feel the blades actually shave my beard except when I use it on my chin and lip.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, the blade is very firm and does not bend in any way.  </li>
            <li> is that it prevents me from pressing the razor too hard and close to my skin.</li>
            <li> Now I can shave at least 4 times before I feel like I need to stop.</li>
            <li> I have never cut my face when using this razor and I am convinced the vibration keeps the blade from cutting too deeply into the skin.  </li>
            <li> Only issue is it is very difficult to get into small spots.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a replacement for a Gillette Fusion I bought at least 5-7 years ago (which looked just like this model).</li>
            <li> so you run a low risk of cutting yourself, even if you&#x27;re ham-handed like I am.  </li>
            <li> Its slick and a bang for your buck!</li>
            <li> I had quite a bit of stubble due to using the mediocre [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> seriously whats with the battery?</li>
            <li> Close to an electric in use, much less expensive.</li>
            <li> Also, the mixture and hair off the razor does not cause serious blockage within the gaps between the three razor blades.  </li>
            <li> Gillette Mach 3 is less scary.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for people with tough beard/sensitive skin combination; it works.</li>
            <li> The handle vibration shakes and numbs your skin, which makes it difficult to tell whether you are shaving too hard or or too close to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not happy this does not come with a holder like the non-power unit came with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really annoyed about not getting a holder.</li>
            <li> They state never use a cloth or brush, but run water from behind the blades.</li>
            <li> cons include a somewhat poorly designed handle.  </li>
            <li> personally feel that (at least for me &amp; my friends) we are in the worst economy of my lifetime (well over 50 years) &amp; $6+ monthly on razors is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford.</li>
            <li> This means that the battery is useless in no time.</li>
            <li> I was worried about expensive replacement blades</li>
            <li> It is extremely difficult to find the powered version of the Mach 3 razor.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> The biggest feature of this product&#x27;s vibration, it is completely useless in the process of Shaven fact.</li>
            <li> Seems kinda useless for me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have yet to find any benefit whatsover of this gimmick.  </li>
            <li> I reached shaving age, I was afraid the use it.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Therefore, it pays a lot of money for any unnecessary feature is a stupid behavior.</li>
            <li> this was as bad as a disposable razor.  </li>
            <li> I HATE the vibrate feature.  </li>
            <li> In all honesty, this is one of the worst neck shaving razors I have gotten, it did a crap job of removing hair from my neck, even when used with their recommended line of shaving gels.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using Gillette razors for a while now, so I thought I&#x27;d give this a chance, but when compared to the razor with more blades and a sideburn precision trimmer (profusion) this one just falls short. the vibration action doesn&#x27;t do anything noticeable - I tried doing a half of my face with it and a half with the profusion - all I got was more scratches with this.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good razor, but the vibration is just a gimmick, I went back to my profusion, and I think I&#x27;ll stay with, I recommend you do the same.</li>
            <li> fair price for a good shaver</li>
            <li> The case for a battery inside a razor needs to keep water out.  This one does not keep out the water.  This means that the battery is useless in no time.</li>
            <li> I know the name of the product is Mach 3, which should have clued me in that it is only 3 blades, but I was still suprised at how I felt very different compared to the 5 blade Fusion I am used to using on a daily basis.  I have sensitive skin and this product is ok but doesn&#x27;t leave my skin much less irritated/red than my Fusion.  It&#x27;s just ok and best for folks that want a lighter shaving experience.</li>
            <li> overall happy with product but often it will break if the suction holder that I use in the shower falls down.  So too flimsy</li>
            <li> FULL DISCLOSURE: I&#x27;m writing this review after only having used the product once. I&#x27;m THAT smitten with it. However, just wanted to mention it. For all I know, the thing may break tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that--wow. I&#x27;d never used a &#x27;power&#x27; razor before, and I&#x27;m not going to lie to you---I was half-convinced it was just a gimmick Gillette had come up with to sell batteries. But I&#x27;d recently started using the regular Mach 3 and liked it, so I thought at the worst, I&#x27;d end up a little wiser and with a back-up razor but no better shave. Well, color me convinced and clean-shaven. I use this to shave my head, and there are a few places that have always been difficult, particularly around the nape of my neck. This razor did the work in seconds. It&#x27;s smoother than it&#x27;s ever been with any other razor, electric or regular, and in a fraction of the time. Triple-love it.</li>
            <li> I liked it very much. it vibrates when you turn it on. This is better than any of newer models with out vibration models.</li>
            <li> This is the best razor ever invented. They are $14 each at my drug store and they are much cheaper on Amazon.  I bought several in case they are discontinued in the future.</li>
            <li> I was wondering why they stopped producing the Mach 3 Power back then when I was looking for a new razor handle as my old one died after 3 years of use. Then I saw they started production on this newer model (uses same mach 3 power blades) and grabbed two. One to use now and one for future when that one goes kaput. Been shaving with Mach 3 for years and highly recommend. Much less expensive than the Fusion Blades and any other new ones.</li>
            <li> I personally got this for my Dad and he really likes this product and will order more.</li>
            <li> Nice product&lt;br /&gt;As described</li>
            <li> Love these razors. I had the original a few years back. It broke after a few years use. I&#x27;m glad Gillette brought these razors back.</li>
            <li> Best shave for sensitive skin, the vibration is in my opinion the key. you will need to go over the tougher areas of your face several times but again it will not irritate the skin. I could shave with only water or very light soap, the blade is that gentle but still provides a top notch shave.  I have wanted one of these for a long time and finally spent the cash and bought it. I was worried about expensive replacement blades but I get about an entire month out of a single blade. just dry it off after each shave and keep it dry.</li>
            <li> nothing fancy, nothing great, just a decent razor.  Perhaps Gillette spoiled us with their other products, but this particular item is decent, nothing spectacular</li>
            <li> It is extremely difficult to find the powered version of the Mach 3 razor. While I have yet to actually shave with the razor yet, I have inserted the included battery to see if it operates and it does. My prior experience with the power Mach 3 (which broke at the handle after 5 years or so where the battery cover is located due to my habit of banging it on the sink edge while shaving to remove hair and cream debris which I have learned not to do anymore) was almost an enjoyable experience if that is possible and the Fusion blades are even more expensive, so I began looking for this. I have already ordered a second one of this item and will now simply glide my thumb down the blades (carefully) to remove debris while under running water rather than slamming it on the sink edge.</li>
            <li> Careful, you screw up once, you pay 3 times.  Still a very solid razor I&#x27;ve used for years when I need my face to be super smooth.  I&#x27;m fairly certain we moved on the the &amp;#34;mach 3 standard&amp;#34; for currency back in the 90s, given the extreme cost of the replacement blades.</li>
            <li> You figure out the other uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought to replace older Mach 3 vibrator handle that gave out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a freaking vibrating battery powered razor handle.</li>
            <li> Mach3 Sensitive is amazing. I&#x27;ve been using Mach3 razors for over 10 years. I&#x27;ve had sensitive skin for as long as I remember. Shaving without shaving cream is like a death wish. I&#x27;ve just recently tried these razor heads. It glides so smoothly and doesn&#x27;t even irritate my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the best shaving experience I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extra vibration helps stimulate the hair follicles so it get&#x27;s a deeper shave. I&#x27;m impressed at the results everyday.</li>
            <li> The vibration does nothing but make a less effective shave.  I found turning it off, and just using the razor was a much closer shave, with less areas that need to touched up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the blade, it works great, but quite overpriced for just the blade.  (If I was rating this without an option to run off the vibration, this would get 1 star.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My perspective... more of a gimmick rather than a useful product.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the power one over the regular one. It only took one or two times to get used to the vibration. The shave is more gentle and has less possibility of cut even when I moved the razor a little faster by accident.</li>
            <li> First... I ain&#x27;t most men, and basically every shaver cuts me, so I have to be discretionary with a vengeance, as I bleed easily, and flow long. Gillette is getting things down as I am tossing Schick Quatros I have. Too much blood loss.  The three Norelcos also caught me. So over the decades, remembering Remington as one that was mild... Minimal white collar tragedies. But all of those did not get a close shave. I do not have any investment in Gillette, nor family, but a friend gave me this little gem. Very worth the small up front expense. Minimal cuts.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it one week, and even my bride did... Impressively close and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Pro:  close accurate minimal lacerating shaver with low entry fee. Excellent workmanship.&lt;br /&gt;Con:  at rate of one cartridge per week, at 3$ usd per cartridge is a little high at 150$ usd per year.  That cost Gillette the top star. Time will tell.</li>
            <li> Best price ever found happy saving days ever since better new design I had the first model in the market still works but Is so old that I had the need for this more clean appealing color&lt;br /&gt;Luis</li>
            <li> I love this razor. I&#x27;ve been using the Mach 3 for a long time and this is a very nice upgrade from that razor. I wondered why I would want my razor to vibrate, but once you try it you will love it. It adds just a little something that makes shaving even easier and more pleasant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad razor, but I really don&#x27;t see what the electric motor is supposed to do - in fact, it makes it less comfortable as it&#x27;s more difficult to hold on to with wet hands while the thing is vibrating.</li>
            <li> I have tried most types (including safety razors) and brand, including most Gilette models and, for some reason, this gives me the most comfortable shave of all. I don&#x27;t know why the vibration should be anything more than a gimmick, but it seems to work. I also prefer this over other more expensive Gilette models with 4 or 5 blades.This one seems lighter and more plasticky than the older model I still have, which feels more solid and still works after 10+ years. Bought this as a second razor to keep in my travel/gym bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for people with tough beard/sensitive skin combination; it works.</li>
            <li> This is the best razor I have ever used. The vibrating feature really helps get a close shave and causes a decrease in irritation which really helps. I would %100 recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really a fan of the handle. The vibration appears to provide no real benefit, it&#x27;s made of pretty flimsy feeling plastic, and otherwise is just unimpressive.</li>
            <li> I bought this new razor for my husband to replace his Mach3 Turbo. He didn&#x27;t like this at all. He used it one time and switched back. He said it didn&#x27;t shave well and ripped up his face.</li>
            <li> Save your money.  I&#x27;m a long time Fusion power user and thought maybe this sensitive would be comparable, it wasn&#x27;t even close.  Even using fusion heating pre shave and fusion cooling aftershave and fusion sensitive shave gel this was as bad as a disposable razor.  Pay the extra dollar a blade and get Fusion or Fusion power.  Threw this in the trash after one shave.  Waste of $10.</li>
            <li> I own several styles of Fusion Mach5 blade shaving units from Gillette.  They are all well made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this Mach3 shaving unit hoping that the replacement blades might be cheaper.  When it arrived, I was shocked at the cheap construction.  Very thin plastic and a cheap switch that will likely break.  It was so cheaply made that it made me wonder if this unit was either: (a) intended for the extremely cost-sensitive emerging markets, or perhaps (b) a cheaply made counterfeit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid $3.77 for this unit but it is so poorly made that it is not even worth $2.  Has Gillette quality really descended to this level of cheapness?  Look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Have been using same razor for many years until it broke. Prefer Mach3 over newer Fusion. Fusion&#x27;s blades are too close together and hard to clean.</li>
            <li> my favorite razor. Having sensitive skin, this stops irritation almost completely for me. Nice, smooth shaving with this.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Mach 3 razor for over 15 years, but never converted to the vibrating version. Now I understand what all the hype is about. I can shave long or short stubble and the vibration keeps the blade from giving me razor burn. I love this thing!</li>
            <li> I usually buy some cheapie brand from Target.  Some of them are really terrible.&lt;br /&gt;I admit this product worked surprisingly well.  And the blade has stayed sharp MUCH longer than the cheapie brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for its size, portability and especially because it was &amp;#34;Sensitive&amp;#34;. And it delivered on being a great size to handle all the contours and difficult spots on the neck and under the chin but the shave was neither sensitive or close. In fact I found myself going over it again with an old Gillette just to get the shave I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Certainly not on my face but ELSEWHERE! why else would a razor be battery powered unless its for pleasure? seriously whats with the battery?</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s go to razor.  He claims the vibration helps with a cleaner shave.  There is a AAA battery included.  He also says the sensitive blade is soothing.  I may have to borrow it and see for myself.</li>
            <li> The market for razors that work best with sensitive skin has an exceptionally capable solution.  My prior razor history is all over the map:  disposables, the regular Mach 3, the Schick Quatro, and the Gillette Fusion.  On rare occasion, irritation would make itself present when exceeding a blade count of three.  The recommendation by a dermatologist involved maintaining with a triple-blade razor.  While I new what to expect from prior experience with the standard Mach 3, this razor actually exceeded those expectations.  Shaving is a pain-free joy now, and the vibration feature of this power razor provides plenty of audible queues as to the effectiveness of the shaving experience.  The reduction of one star stems from the power button.  While it visually flows with the design of the handle, its position makes it prone to being accidentally pressed when holding the razor at a slightly odd angle.  Refill cartridges are reasonably priced, and it&#x27;s a worthwhile investment if you suffer from irritation after shaving.</li>
            <li> If three blades aren&#x27;t cutting it, two more won&#x27;t help. This razor is very comfortable to the hand and gives a great shave.</li>
            <li> My husband likes his new razor but forgets to turn it on because he really cant tell much difference with vibrate on or off. The style is good, easy to grip. He Is blind and this easily gives him a smooth shave.  I would recommend it for sensitive skin like his.</li>
            <li> It was a relief to find that this razor handle fit the old, regular Mach3 blades I found stashed away while cleaning.  Apparently, some of the blades had been stocked up and then the razor mistakenly thrown away.  After briefly toying with the idea of trying to handcraft some sort of handle that would make the blades usable, I decided to try Amazon.  Hallelujah, this purchase worked!  Saved me a bundle, as there were a lot of blades that would have gone to waste.  Tossed the battery in with my other batteries, didn&#x27;t need any of the &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; features advertised, just needed a Mach3 compatible handle.  So pleased!</li>
            <li> Works great but I wonder how long it will run before water gets into the battery compartment. Seem to be well-made, so I&#x27;ll expect several years of service.</li>
            <li> very happy with this razor I didnt want to us a five blade regularly and the standard 2 and 3 blades werent cutting it but the pulsations make the shave so much better i highly recommend for men who have been shaving for less than 20 years</li>
            <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> I have an obscure skin disorder called Porphyria, which basically means I have very sensitive skin. So I have to be very careful about the products and methods I use to shave with. I usually keep a beard to help curb flair-ups, but still like to have a good, clean shave from time to time. I have a Norelco 3D, which is excellent. But sometimes, ya just wanna shave with a blade. A nice blade shave just feels better than any other. I&#x27;ve even used to do straight razor shaves, when I was younger and my skin could still handle it, and had a steadier hand. So when I ran across this Mach3, I was instantly drawn to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Mach3 Shaved 10 Years Off My Face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who is that sweet, smooth baby face staring back at me in the mirror? He&#x27;s kinda cute, or at least that&#x27;s what my hubby says. *Blush* l remember that guy... he used to be me, when I had more spring in my step. Where have you been, dude?  Nice to see you again. ;oD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Trifecta of Precision, Mobility and Vibration&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Mach3 boasts a Pressure Control System that includes self-adjusting spring mounted blades, a pivoting head and battery operated micro pulse system that makes the blades vibrate and feel tingly. Yup - the battery is even included; always a good way to score bonus points with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a Blade - It&#x27;s Electric - It Makes Me Feel Like I Can Jump Buildings in a Single Bound!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, maybe not in a single bound. But perhaps with good running start and a catapult....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades vibrate and adjust automatically to the contours of my face. The pressure is always a perfect, light touch, gliding across my face. It actually feels nice. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my super sensitive skin. When did disposable blades become modern tech?  I&#x27;ve used all kinds of &#x27;breakthrough&#x27; blades for sensitive skin, but they honestly didn&#x27;t work as good as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other Cool Stuff:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Enhanced Lubrastrip - yup, fancy speak for a lubricant strip on the blades&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Easy to Rinse - just hold it under the tap&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Replaceable Blade Cartridges - obvious but still worth saying&lt;br /&gt;&gt; 10 Soft Elastomeric Microfins - who-da-whudda? It helps the blades get close somehow&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Cool Feeling Handle - grippy-comfy in my paws&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Coated Blades - apparently it&#x27;s a good thing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replacement Cartridges:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt; [[ASIN:B00AFCP3GE Gillette Mach3 Sensitive Power Cartridges -- 8 Count]]&lt;br /&gt;&gt; [[ASIN:B00AFCP6W0 Gillette Mach3 Sensitive Power Cartridges -- 10 Count]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line -- I like this blade a lot and will definitely keep using it as part of my shave regimen. It&#x27;s fun to have a baby face again.

            <li> Works great nice close shave .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a while now. I am very pleased with it. It has made a big difference. I have very sensitive skin and could not shave more that once or twice a week without problems. Now I can shave at least 4 times before I feel like I need to stop. This is great!!!</li>
            <li> I shave everyday and this is the best razor I have ever used.  I will never go back to a non power one</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think that a powered manual razor would make a difference. Boy was I wrong.&lt;br /&gt;It provides a smoother closer shave than I thought possible</li>
            <li> Great razor for price, but I forgot how much technology has changed from 3 blade to 4 blade. I did surprisingly like the &#x27;power&#x27; feature though. I bought it for my legs and under arms. The power feature really gives a closer shave under the arms. It works pretty well on my legs too, but I have to go pretty slow for fear of nicking.</li>
            <li> I have had this razor for about 7 years. The only thing I&#x27;ve had to do to it is change the battery and blades.</li>
            <li> Oh yeah. Nice n smooth...</li>
            <li> Very good razor I like it very much I would recommend it</li>
            <li> I love this razor.  I originally thought that the vibration feature was a gimmick but it really does help.  The vibration helps create a close shave with less chance of a nick or cut.  I have never cut my face when using this razor and I am convinced the vibration keeps the blade from cutting too deeply into the skin.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I got this such a long time ago, and I use it a couple of times a week, and it still runs on same battery!  Works as it&#x27;s supposed it.  Nothing fancy.</li>
            <li> Cost effective, efficient, easy to use. Close to an electric in use, much less expensive. Replacement packages also low​ cost. GREAT ITEM!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this model for years. Can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> Been shaving 59 years, mostly wet-shaving with d/e blades. A few electric razors. Vowed I&#x27;d never use a &amp;#34;cheap, plastic, multi-blade razor.&amp;#34; Tried Gillette Manual Vision and Schick Quattros. Began using the Mach 3 couple weeks ago. Wow ! One cart per week and no irritation. I found a heavier handle that accepts the carts and  makes an ideal shaving tool for me. So, thanks for making this razor. If you could design a metal handle with real heft that would last a few decades, I&#x27;d buy one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David Baird&lt;br /&gt;Catlin, Illinois</li>
            <li> I had an older Mach 3 that I&#x27;ve had for years.  I needed another but could not find the original on Amazon.  I ordered one of these figuring it would be similar.  The handle portion is very light and feels pretty cheaply made, I feel like it would break if I gripped it too hard.  The shave is what you would expect from any other mach 3, the super lubricated mega strip or whatever they call it these days feels the same as my other mach 3 blades.  I&#x27;m not a fan of the vibrating feature.  By the time I&#x27;m finishing up shaving my hand feels numb, which isn&#x27;t exactly what I want when I have a razor sharp blade pressed against my face. It also doesn&#x27;t help shave any closer. At the end of the day I&#x27;m going to look around my local stores for the old original style mach 3 which is heavier and feels more durable.</li>
            <li> I used the M3 Power razor for a long time. I liked the head pivot, the lubrication strip was good for my sensitive skin, and the little motor made it easier to get through my neck &amp; facial stubble without feeling like it was being yanked out with a pair of pliers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are still available here and there, but the M3 Power razor was discontinued. I saw this Mach3 Sensitive was available, and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, this razor provided a good shave for me. But it wasn&#x27;t long before I realized this razor wasn&#x27;t an improvement from the M3 Power...it was an imitation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve uploaded a picture to the \\&quot;Customer Images\\&quot; section of the product. As you can see, both razors look extremely similar to each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only difference I could find (other than the silver/white razor color) was the color of the strips - the M3&#x27;s lubrication strip was orange, whereas the strip on the Mach3 Sensitive was green. Everything else felt exactly the same...the head pivot, the vibrations from the motor, the close shave, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old MP3 power blades are still available (at the time this review is being written) and the cost of the M3 Power blades are less than the cost of the Mach3 Sensitive blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While The Mach3 Sensitive is a good razor, I don&#x27;t see where it was necessary to discontinue the M3 Power and release a near-identical razor with higher priced blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t broke, Gillette...so there was no need to fix it.</li>
            <li> Although this product looks interesting, it works terribly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea behind this razor is that it vibrates, which is supposed to create a better shave.  The problem is, it absolutely doesn&#x27;t create a better shave.  The handle vibration shakes and numbs your skin, which makes it difficult to tell whether you are shaving too hard or or too close to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, the vibrations made it slightly difficult to shave straight.  Additionally, the blade is very firm and does not bend in any way.  It feels very unforgiving.  So, although the shaving gel was removed by the razor, not all of the hair formerly under the gel was gone (as I figured out later that day).  Halfway through my shave I immediately went back to my Schick Xtreme3 disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of all this, the replacement cartridges are, apparently, pretty expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not waste my time on this product.  It seems to me a gimmick that I recommend avoiding.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor only expecting something that would keep me going for the time being. However I&#x27;m very pleased with it so far. It&#x27;s very light and gives a nice smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only had two small issues that I would have changed it I had designed it. One being I would have added more rubber to the handle to make it easier to hold and the other being changing the placement of the power button. As it is, it&#x27;s right where I grip when I use this unit and I often accidentally turn off the shaver when using it. It&#x27;s no big deal but just something to be noted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even so, it&#x27;s a very good razor and I recommend getting it if the cost isn&#x27;t too high</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Gillette products. Personally I feel they are better in almost every respect than most all others on the market--or at least that WAS my opinion before I tried several different brands which offered me a great, smooth shave without the stupidly high prices that usually accompany Gillette products. I cite as a good alternative example, the Schick Hydro 5 razor (although in the last several months I&#x27;ve noticed the prices on that razor have gone up considerably), and a few Bic disposable 4 bladed razors work exceptionally well, especially when factoring in price. In the last several months, I have discovered a generic brand 5-bladed razor that you can purchase at Kroger which looks suspiciously like the Gillette ProGlide (but the razors are not compatible with the other handles in case you were wondering), also I found a 6-bladed model at Walgreens which gives a great shave as well...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...but this is about Gillette&#x27;s new Mach3 Sensitive razor. At first I wondered why Gillette was trying to continue the Mach3 brand seeing as it was several years old already and has seen better days, but I jumped in and ordered mine anyway. I&#x27;ve always preferred the styling of a Gillette to pretty much everything else if the truth be told, but does it really shave better for those of us guys with sensitive skin? Honestly, I don&#x27;t think it shaves any better than the regular Mach3 did. I DID notice, however after my first shave--which I found to be very comfortable--that I had a larger number of areas where I was bleeding than usual...quite a large amount, surprisingly. I haven&#x27;t noticed this with subsequent shaves, but thought it was worth noting all the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lets face it, if I could afford to, I would more than likely use nothing BUT Gillette products...however, my sad, little budget keeps me a few notches down and I&#x27;ve found significantly great shaves using everything from lesser brand name razors (Schick Hydro 5) to essentially generic brands you can get for 75% cheaper, wich STILL offers a shave just as good as the most expensive ProGlide razor promises. So, if you have the money to burn, go ahead and spend it. If you&#x27;re like me, sometimes cheaper really IS as good as spending more. But to each his own...everyone is different, just like everyone&#x27;s face is, so your shave may vary.can get for 75% cheaper, wich STILL offers a shave just as good as the most expensive ProGlide razor promises. So, if you have the money to burn, go ahead and spend it. If you&#x27;re like me, sometimes cheaper really IS as good as spending more. But to each his own...everyone is different, just like everyone&#x27;s face is, so your shave may vary.</li>
            <li> I wondered about how this might be a great razor at the time I ordered it. The fact is, I was ultimately dissapointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose the idea is that the battery-powered vibration will chop off the stubble close to the skin. It does this in all the places which are easy to get to but in those troublesome curves, I ended up having to use my old stand-by disposable razor to finish shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this razor might be okay for a lady to shave her legs, (and I wouldn&#x27;t swear to that), I found it to be lacking for shaving one&#x27;s face. I think we&#x27;ll be seeing lots of these razors at a discount price at the Big Lots stores in the not-so-far future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Mach 3 razors for years; they&#x27;re the most effective and longest-lasting disposable razors on the market. I dry shave a lot (due in part to the fact that I don&#x27;t grow a heavy beard, and in part to the fact that sometimes I let the beard grow in and only need to &#x27;touch up&#x27; my neck and cheeks), and the Mach 3 works without causing any discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first time using a Mach 3 with the vibrating action, and it makes a BIG difference. It basically allows me to get the same level of shaving effectiveness without having to apply any real pressure to the shaver. Wet shaving with gel is like a dream, and dry shaving is completely painless and almost completely effortless. I have an electric razor, but I use the Mach 3 Sensitive Power more because it&#x27;s so easy and because it works so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s highly recommended for buyers who are looking for an easy, comfortable, effective shave without dropping a lot of money on an electric razor.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the Mach 3 Sensitive razor. He has sensitive skin so this causes less irritation than other razors he has used in the past. He gets a very close shave with this razor which I guess he says is partly due to it being batttery powered. Each cartridge has 3 advance coating blades for a better shave. Also compared to other razors the refill cartridges are average price. The only thing is you will eventually have to replace the battery but the battery usually lasts a few months depending on how much you shave.</li>
            <li> + The green strip for sensitive skin really works - it feels much better than any other shaver I had before&lt;br /&gt;+ Vibration helps clean shave in a single sweep&lt;br /&gt;+ Easy to clean under running tap&lt;br /&gt;+ Blades replaceable with any other Mach3 blade cartridges&lt;br /&gt;+ AAA battery, no fuss of charger when taking this for travel&lt;br /&gt;+ Perfect grip, overall weight is just right&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t find any cons on this product! Love it.</li>
            <li> Good smooth shave although has caused nicks. Still best shave for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The most important thing to note about this razor is that it was previously sold as the Gillette M3 Power, which has been on the market for years. There is no difference between the handle or blades of Mach3 Sensitive Power and M3 Power. It&#x27;s simply a new name and a new paint job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I did purchase and use this razor under its new name but was not particularly impressed. If you use high-quality shave cream/gel, the vibrating option of this razor is not really necessary and can even result in a shave that isn&#x27;t as close, because you can&#x27;t feel the blades passing over your facial hair. The handle itself is plastic which I found to be a little too light -- using a handle with good weight (like the metal Mach3 or Mach3 Turbo handle) is a key part of the shaving process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the overall aesthetics of the razor. It has a great feel in the hand and the grips are better than those on the standard Mach3 handles.</li>
            <li> I tried the Gillette Mach3 Sensitive Power Razor and have to say it proves a good, long lasting shave.  I have very thick facial hair and the razor left my face feeling smooth and with a shave that would last a full day.  The power vibration was a bit strange when I first used it but I quickly became accustomed to the vibrations.  This is a very good product but be sure to have the power off when shaving tight spots or the razor can cut into your skin.</li>
            <li> This is my second Mach 3 razor. My first one lasted 8 years. This time I bought the sensitive razor and cartridge. The shave is noticeably smoother with far less irritation and no nicks or cuts. The razors seem to be sharper than the regular M3 power cartridges. If you don&#x27;t buy the razor at least try the sensitive cartridge.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt; + Mach 3 is the only blade that doesn&#x27;t result in a clogged blade. (4 &amp; 5 blades seem to require a lot of rinsing)&lt;br /&gt; + Powered (1 battery) seems to last a while&lt;br /&gt; + Vibration helps move it across skin a bit more easily&lt;br /&gt; + Blades last long, even despite the &#x27;cooling strip&#x27; wearing down first</li>
            <li> Great item. Quick shipping. A++++++</li>
            <li> I got this razor since it seemed like a good idea, a razor that vibrates. I wasn&#x27;t prepared for just how great it works. I used my regular shaving cream and got the closest shave I can ever remember getting. Because the razor vibrates, you don&#x27;t need to use any real pressure to get a very close shave. I sometimes go without shaving over a weekend when I&#x27;m not going out of the house. With two extra days of growth, this razor still gave me an unbelievably close shave without any extra effort. This is a very highly recommended razor. I can almost guarantee that you will love it!</li>
            <li> Purchased the Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor first and did not like it because it was bulky, fat, and hard to maneuver around my lips and under my nose area...  there are too many blades (5) that causes the shaving head to be too large.  Then purchased the Gillette Mach 3 Sensitive Power Razor and what a pleasant difference.  Seems that Gillette realized the shorcomings of the Fusion Proglide Power so introduced the Mach 3 Sensitive Razor.  Before blaming the razor for any shortcomings, be sure its not your preparation before shaving that&#x27;s at fault.  Currently using a mixture of a dab of Kiss My Face shave cream and some diluted Bath and Body Works shower gel, working the mixture into the skin before shaving.  Not much lather, but a lot of moist lubrication.  Also, the mixture and hair off the razor does not cause serious blockage within the gaps between the three razor blades.  Just flush out the shaving debris with running hot/warm water.  After shaving and rinsing, apply rubbing alcohol to the razor blades and just let dry in an empty cup.  I currently prefer the power feature \\&quot;on.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing Gillette razors since I was a teenager.  The thing that I&#x27;ve come to expect over the years is that the razor comes with the handle, a blade and a carrying case.  This one did not.  I just called 1-800-GILLETTE and am not satisfied with the response that I got. She told me pretty much that there are 2 part numbers with every Gillette product, one that comes with a case and one that does not.  I question the accuracy of that answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked her for 2 things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) send me a case.  She said they cannot.&lt;br /&gt;2) If there are 2 part numbers, give me the part number of the product with the case.  She said that she doesn&#x27;t have that information available which is why I question the accuracy of the information I got on the phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 stars.  Minus 1 for missing case.  Minus 2 for unhelpful response from Gillette rep.  I&#x27;m looking for a response from P&amp;G about how to get a case that I&#x27;ve gotten with every other Gillette razor that I&#x27;ve purchased over the past 30 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right now razor is sitting in a drawer blade down.  1 of 2 things is going to happen.  1) blade will get ruined quickly.  2) Blade will get turned over and someone will stick their hand in and get nicked.  If #2 happens then a very different conversation will be had with P&amp;G.</li>
            <li> I had one of the older styles for 10 years. I just replaced it with this model. Works just like the old one.</li>
            <li> I first saw a dynamic safety razor nearly 50 years ago. My father used the wind up vibrating double edged safety razor twice and then put in on a shelf where is sat until mom finally threw it out.&lt;br /&gt;When I reached shaving age, I was afraid the use it.&lt;br /&gt;This Gillette Mach 3 is less scary. The vibration occurs at a much higher frequency and you don&#x27;t have the problem of it slowing down because you don&#x27;t need to rewind it. So far, I have not found that it improves the shaving experience, which is already pretty good with a standard Mach 3 razor.</li>
            <li> Love this little razor. Only issue is it is very difficult to get into small spots. Other than that, it&#x27;s a great little shaver.</li>
            <li> A nice and comfortable shave. I don&#x27;t get the red, irritated look on my neck, that I do with regular razor.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Mach 3 razor remains my favorite razor, having served me well for nearly a decade. This version offers vibrations for added &amp;#34;comfort&amp;#34; and less &amp;#34;irritation.&amp;#34; The vibrations don&#x27;t really add much to my shaving experience, but the razors are sharp and last a fair amount of time before needing to be replaced.  It remains the best of any major razor brand that I&#x27;ve used but still looking for a closer, more consistent shave.</li>
            <li> I used other \\&quot;power\\&quot; razors years back and wanted to see if any improvement has been made over the years and the answer is....Not quite there yet.  Simply put:  One size(or in this case vibration) does not fit all.  Everyone is different and some people are not effected by it all, like myself.  However, as a stand-alone product, this razor is still good enough to be called a Gillette.  If you never tried a \\&quot;power\\&quot; razor, feel free to try one with a tiny caveat that you will slightly overpay for your trial and error.  Blades from other types are not interchangeable, so if you are not impressed, you cannot switch to regular blades and will have to pass it on to a friend of yours to see if it works for them.</li>
            <li> ...for as long as they make it. I suppose there may be something newer and better and lots more expensive out there, but i&#x27;m happy with the Mach III line and the powered wands. They work a lot better than most electrics, have pretty good blade life, and a more reasonable cost. I guess this is my 3rd or 4th one in maybe 10 years or more? -just a guess really. Anyway, I&#x27;m a fan and will keep using these for as long as I can...</li>
            <li> So far I think I like the non-power model better. I am not happy this does not come with a holder like the non-power unit came with. My shaving experience is not as good either. With the manual I can feel and hear that hair is being removed. I will give the power unit more uses, but because I think the blades of the non-power unit blades last longer for me I&#x27;ll try that blade with the power unit. If I get no improvement I&#x27;ll go back to the standard non-power unit, or use the power unit in the off position. I&#x27;m really annoyed about not getting a holder. I need one for storage and travel.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a replacement for a Gillette Fusion I bought at least 5-7 years ago (which looked just like this model). Never had to replace the head. However, the battery cover started slipping repeatedly. Very happy it lasted as long as it did. Picked this model as a replacement instead of the newer and bulkier Fusion. Loving it. Batteries seem to last a long time and they really give a closer, smoother shave than the non-powered models. I use it in the shower or tub. My skin is too sensitive to use this for a dry shave.</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of blades &#x3D; 3. Not useless on course beard hair like 4 blades are. Not irritating on skin like 2 blade razors are. The vibration action helps the razor glide along skin and also helps rinse clear the blades when rinsing in water. The Mach 3 regular power razor and blades are just as good. The extra price for the green lubricating strip next to the blades vs. the blue of regular blades is just extra price, unless you believe the color difference has extra lubrication properties as the manufacturer claims of course. Personally I find no difference in effect when using, but a big difference in price when purchasing \\&quot;sensitive mach 3\\&quot; vs, mach 3.</li>
            <li> Works great my hubby uses and it reduces his razor burn to nil. I am sure the numbr of blades help with that too.</li>
            <li> This is a very soft comfortable razor, I wish it would cut a little closer but it gets the job done. If you have problems with razor rash I would get this it&#x27;s very soft and nice but other then that I would pick a razor with a better cut, I think it&#x27;s because it only has 3 blades it doesn&#x27;t get too close of a cut still nice to have</li>
            <li> Not true that \\&quot;all Mach 3 cartridges fit on all Mach 3 razors/handles.\\&quot;  Contrary to this product claim, it is NOT true that all Mach 3 razor blades work/fit firmly on the M3 Power Sensitive handle.  My regular Mach 3 Turbo blades definitely do not stay attached/fit on the brand new Power Sensitive handle I just purchased.  Actually, nor do the M3 Power blades, if you pull on them a bit (but they do fit somewhat, at least, whereas the Mach 3 Turbo blades do not fit/stay on the Power Sensitive handle at all!).  In other words, ONLY the Mach 3 Sensitive Power blades in particular stay firmly attached (even with pulling/tugging) on the Mach 3 Power Sensitive handle.  So it&#x27;s annoying to have buy those particular, separate blades- M3 Sensitive blades only- for the M3 Power Sensitive handle.</li>
            <li> works great, really satisfied with the price and durability. will but again.&lt;br /&gt;saved more than half than buying it at the supermarket.</li>
            <li> Tried it twice and went back to the normal Mach3. Just didnd&#x27;t see how this version help my shaving experience.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver, I have been using the Mach3 since they came out. I had the original turbo when it came out but after years of abuse it broke. I thought I was going to have to switch until they started selling these again, I was so pumped I bought 3 (2 spares), and they were only like $9.99 or something like that. I will not purchase anything else, still don&#x27;t care for more than 3 blades and whatever other fancy shenanigans are out there. I love that it vibrates, which actually helps me avoid razor burn since I have sensitive skin. I just buy whatever Mach3 blades are the cheapest. I am always amazed that the vibrating feature makes the shave less irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 4/9/2015:&lt;br /&gt;I have reduced my rating for this as a shaving option all together. Over the last several years I feel duped by Gillette. Not only have the prices of the disposable cartridges gone up through the roof, there are better options out there. The entire shaving supply industry is a big marketing gimmick! The final nail in the coffin was the price going up yet again, and seemingly the quality of the cartridge falling since they used to last me close to a month, now the cartridges last about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched to double edged safety razors, and I will never look back. The blades are dirt cheap! (average is $0.15/blade if you buy a 100 pack), and the shave is better quality with less irritation, even though there is a learning curve and technique is more important, well worth the switch.</li>
            <li> When I bought this, I didn&#x27;t realize you can put a battery in it for added vibration I guess, which I haven&#x27;t even bothered to try.  I really just wanted a Mach3 shaver in a color different than my husband&#x27;s, so that&#x27;s why I purchased it.  Ironically, all of the shavers made for women (I am a female), usually leave me with a cut or two unless I am super careful.  But the Mach3 is hands down the best shave I have had to date.  Super close shave without the nicks and cuts.  I am blonde and do not have very course or thick hair, but if Mach3 in general works perfectly for my legs and perfectly for my husband&#x27;s course facial hair, seems like it is a sure bet for everyone.  Now I only have to buy one type of refill cartridge and we aren&#x27;t getting our shavers confused.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Mach 3 in various forms since its introduction more than a decade ago.  Starting with the regular Mach 3, then Mach 3 Turbo, and now Mach 3 Sensitive.  This latest iteration has built in motorized vibrations to help with blade to skin contact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle itself is larger.  It&#x27;s fatter and about half inch longer but it feels like it has the same weight as the old Mach 3/Turbo with the battery inside.  I guess they had to make the handle larger to accommodate the single AAA battery that&#x27;s included. But there&#x27;s no difference in hand in terms of the weight. The slightly larger size does take a bit to get use to as it&#x27;s not as maneuverable. Battery life seems ok, about three weeks if used daily. I&#x27;m using rechargeable so it&#x27;s no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real question is how does it perform against the regular, non vibrating models? In simplest terms, it works.  It does indeed help cut down on the nicks. It will help to reduce the number of passes to get the same close cut.  The vibration will take some getting use to. It&#x27;s a bit jarring at first, especially in the mornings.  Perhaps Gillett will introduce a new model later that will only vibrate the blade so that the handle won&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re holding on to a jackhammer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use all the Mach 3 blades for this Sensitive model.  As far as I can tell, my old Mach 3 Turbo blades are exactly the same except for the color. So, you maybe able to save some dough just buying the old blades if you don&#x27;t care about color matching.  The Green and White color combo reminds me of the Hulk ride at Universal. In any case, it grows on you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent razor, with plenty of blades and a swivel head so you run a low risk of cutting yourself, even if you&#x27;re ham-handed like I am.  But I don&#x27;t really see the point of the battery-operated vibration.  It doesn&#x27;t do anything special for my face and is kind of annoying.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend traveling with it, because if it vibrates in your bag, you&#x27;re going to be spending some quality time with a TSA agent.  (Anyone remember the scene from Fight Club?)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been years since Gillette discontinued their much-loved Venus Vibrance razor - and I&#x27;ve treasured mine ever since then, and still use it to this day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s the vibration for? - To get a close shave on very sensitive skin.  I have very fair, sensitive skin, reddish blonde hair and my skin is covered with lots of little bumps and birth marks - only vibrating shavers do not cause major irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And finally some even better news: regular blue Venus cartridges fit this razor and snap on without any problems - I tried!  In essence you get powered razor with Venus blades.</li>
            <li> Its slick and a bang for your buck! I got this for 2.99 after a promo code. Replaceable heads.</li>
            <li> No complaints with this product. To be honest, I hate shaving (but don&#x27;t want facial hair either, so it&#x27;s a necessary evil) and am prone to giving myself cuts by rushing through the job, so it&#x27;s important for me to have a shaver that does a good, smooth job and protects me from myself. I&#x27;m not exactly sure what the gain is with this shaver that one gets by activating the battery-operated electric function, but the humming buzz feels good on my face when that&#x27;s going. And, regardless of the effect of that feature, the shaver itself is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used in a long life of dreaded shaves. It&#x27;s smooth enough so that it doesn&#x27;t hurt to go over the various ridges on your face, and effective enough so that when you get done, you find that you&#x27;ve got a nice, clean look going. Tops.</li>
            <li> I picked this up for my travel kit.  I used it for about 10 days total.  Since I regularly use the Gillette Fusion, I can offer the following comparisons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sensitive version is lighter than the Fusion version.  The blades are not interchangeable.  The main difference is, in all honesty, that this is a cheaper version of the Fusion.  I&#x27;m sure they put a lot of effort into making the glide strip better for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, this is a great razor and is similar to the Fusion I use every day.</li>
            <li> It was a bit disconcerting to feel my razor vibrate and it took a few days to get used to it. After that, it worked great. The best think I can say about this is that it prevents me from pressing the razor too hard and close to my skin. In my half-awake state I have been known to slice my skin open with my unpowered Mach3 by pressing it too hard. And what a gusher these cuts can be. This motorized version makes it possible to get a close shave while preventing one from exerting too much pressure.</li>
            <li> Well, it definitely seems to work well for me on my face. I probably won&#x27;t use this to shave my head bald, because I think it dulls my razors quicker that way. So I&#x27;m going to use this one just for my face and it works great. The vibration does seem to cut my hair better, but it works well without the vibration, which is good if that battery dies. Matter of a fact, the last couple times I used it, I forgot to use the power. So I would definitely say this razor works well for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Gillette Mach3 razors for years.  I have sensitive skin and often develop a rash on my neck when shaving.  This sensitive power razor seems like just the ticket!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gillette comes with a battery and a single razor head to get you started.  I found that it works quite well though the sensation is unusual.  It is hard to decide if you are pushing hard enough or not when shaving.  I did find that 2-day long whiskers shave off with much less pain due to the motor action.  Instead of feeling ripped out of my skin, their really isn&#x27;t any feeling as they are cut off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I haven&#x27;t had any rash on my neck while using this.  I also found that (because of the battery?) the blade lasts longer than usual for me.  I typically discard my Mach3 razors after three uses.  I&#x27;m on my fourth use with this blade and it still feels fine.  I know many people probably keep their razors for more than three uses ($$$), but after the third use with a regular mach 3, it is very rough on my skin and leaves me with more rashes.  This one seems to do a better job and prevent that, allowing more uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;m happy with this Gillette.  If I can get used to the odd sensation when shaving, I&#x27;ll be even happier!  This razor is definitely worth a shot if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It works okay, but a normal Mach 3 gets you a much closer shave! Just get the Neutrogena Sensitive Skin Shaving Cream instead : http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B003156NJI?pc_redir&#x3D;1396221812&amp;robot_redir&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;The sensitive skin shaving cream is more like a creamy oil &amp; a little goes a longgg way! Pair that with the normal Mach 3 and you will have a close have and no razor bumps or irritation!</li>
            <li> The biggest feature of this product&#x27;s vibration, it is completely useless in the process of Shaven fact. Therefore, it pays a lot of money for any unnecessary feature is a stupid behavior.</li>
            <li> Probably the best razor available in the market. The difference between a regular one and a power one is striking. Much easier to use</li>
            <li> Been using this razor daily for about two months now.  Some points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I HATE the vibrate feature.  It&#x27;s a personal thing, just something I can&#x27;t stand to feel on my face while shaving.  Sometimes I&#x27;d accidentally hit the vibrate button and end up nicking my face.  If you don&#x27;t like vibrate, pull the battery.&lt;br /&gt;- My wife LOVES the vibrate feature.  She has major back issues that left her with partial nerve damage in one of her legs.  When she shaves her legs she can&#x27;t really feel a normal razor and ends up cutting herself.  With the vibrate feature on this razor, she can feel what she&#x27;s doing and has less issues.&lt;br /&gt;- It shaves pretty well, much closer/smoother than any electric I&#x27;ve used.  However sometimes it doesn&#x27;t do the greatest job on a couple nooks and crannies on my face, but I&#x27;ve yet to try a razor that didn&#x27;t have trouble with those spots.&lt;br /&gt;- Blades last me about a week and a half before I change them out.  Thinking of trying some razor sharpener gizmo that will extend the life of the blades.  Replacements are around $20 for 8, so that&#x27;s nearly 3 months for me so really it&#x27;s not that bad.&lt;br /&gt;- Fits decently well in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In total, it&#x27;s not a bad razor.  Would rate higher if I cared for the main selling point of this model, the &amp;#34;power&amp;#34;/vibrate feature.</li>
            <li> I did not know that this thing vibrates when I bought it. Vibration though does not do anything. I shaved half my face with vibrating feature and half without and there was no difference. I am not sure, but vibration may help clean the blade.</li>
            <li> Gillette&#x27;s new Mach 3 Sensitive Power Razor is not much different from their Mach 3 Fusion Power Razor. The Sensitive Power razor is basically the same design as the Fusion Power razor with it&#x27;s battery operated vibrating blades, and the only noticeable difference is the blades seam a bit sharper on the Sensitive Power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the Mach 3 Fusion Power and Mach 3 Sensitive Power razors are the same design and the blades are only slightly different, I&#x27;ll just stick with the Gillette Mach 3 Fusion Power, which has always given me a great close comfortable shave for years.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the vibration.  Standard shaving experience.  Nothing special.  I will stick with the standard Fusion blades I have been using.</li>
            <li> This razor works well, but not any better than other good-quality razors on the market.  The vibration from the battery seems a bit gimmicky to me.  Yes, it did make it feel kind of nice but did it really improve the shave?  I&#x27;m not convinced that it did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also concerns me that there will be millions of batteries containing toxic waste to be disposed of when we can simply use a regular razor.  It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s a strenuous task to shave without battery power.</li>
            <li> If your claim to fame is your other razor is a POS and so this razor competes well against your other product...just quit already.  LMAO at this one!  I&#x27;ll stick with Schick ST2 disposables and Extreme3 Disposables since they&#x27;re better than anything Gillette has made in the last 25 years.  \\&quot;Mach3 vs Gillette Comfort3!\\&quot;  Really?  Again: LMAO!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for hubby to try, since he has used the Gillette Mach 3 series for years. We received a battery-powered (battery included) vibrating razor with a blade good for sensitive-skin. Little did we know that the vibration would produce such a close smooth shave. And even though it doesn&#x27;t say you can, hubby has been using this gadget in the shower with no problems. I recently purchased replacement blades, and hubby requested the Mach3 Sensitive blades. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I thought that power handles on manual razors were a joke.  But this Power Mach3 Sensitive is persuading me otherwise.  I don&#x27;t know if the vibration actually makes the shave gentler or it just changes the amount of pressure I apply intuitively, but this has given me a nick-free shave on the FIRST shave.  I can&#x27;t remember when this last happened, even with Fusion razors or older cartridge designs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s more, I have been an off-and-on fan of wet shaving, and  of course, every first shave with a new DE -- no matter how mild -- results in nicks and cuts. I&#x27;m just used to first shaves being harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A surprisingly good version of the venerable Mach3 setup and Gillette should re-issue this power handle.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using an electric safety razor, and I&#x27;m very impressed. Using [[ASIN:B001E0ZIWU Grandpa&#x27;s Soap Pine Tar 4.25 oz ( Multi-Pack)]] instead of a shave gel or a non-aerosol shave cream, I got a great shave on my 60+ year old face. The expense of the cartridges is why I&#x27;ve knocked off a star, but I&#x27;m sure the price will eventually come down.</li>
            <li> I love these razors and especially the feature of shaving with vibrator razor.&lt;br /&gt;The process is so smooth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of the Mach3 line since they came out, but went a bit cheap in the last 6 months by picking up a set of Mangum 5 razors and replacement heads that were one sale at Costco.  Switching back to the this Mach3 was like the difference between night and day, a much smoother shave without needing to go cover the same spot multipe times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying out the Mach3 Sensitive on some areas that were prone to redness and sensitivity after shaving didn&#x27;t show any useful result.  I mean, compared to the Magnums I&#x27;d been using there was a definate difference, as in there was little or no redness or sensitivity with the Mach3 while there always was with the Magnum.  But turning on the Mach3&#x27;s vibration didn&#x27;t appear to do anything diferrent than leaving it off.  I&#x27;m guessing that it means that either the Mach3 Sensitive does nothing for my skin that another Mach3 can&#x27;t, but perhaps my skin isn&#x27;t sensitive enough to need a sensitive razor like this one.</li>
            <li> I have bought Harry&#x27;s razors and thought I would give this a try due to the wirecutter review.  This blade is horrible and I can&#x27;t believe that it was rated better than Harry&#x27;s.  The vibration button is a gimmick and doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stick with Harry&#x27;s...</li>
            <li> Great shaving kit for me, thank you !!!</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver. I dislike shavers with multiple razors as they tend to cut a bit into the skin for me.&lt;br /&gt;This one cleans easy, only has 3 razors, and cuts close without cutting too close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sidenote: I don&#x27;t use the vibration feature. Seems kinda useless for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been pleased with the Mach 3  blades. I had heard about the vibrating shaver. It&#x27;s well worth the extra money considering the price of the blades. I was glad to be able to use my existing blades. Right now I am just trimming of beard, but it&#x27;s very nice to have that little vibration as I trim very intricate parts of my face.</li>
            <li> Nice solid shave. Prefer the Fusion slightly more, but this is lower cost per shave.</li>
            <li> I promised I would update this review once I learned how long the cartridges lasted, so here we go. First, the next paragraph is what I originally wrote 2 days after receipt of the razor on 3/7/13:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t really judge this razor until I see how long the cartridge lasts, &amp; as we&#x27;re requested to get these reviews up quickly, please consider this a place holder. I will update when I learn how long the (not cheap) cartridge lasts. Basically I would consider the razor to be a good value if I get at least a month out of a [[ASIN:B00AFCOUXG cartridge at today&#x27;s pricing;]] preferably more like 2 months. Less than a month, I&#x27;m financially better off using premium hand razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the update on 3/20/13: The cartridge lasted just over 2 weeks, shaving once a day. Even at grocery store prices, that&#x27;s over $6.00 a month. Disposable Gillete&#x27;s are much cheaper. I also personally stocked up on the disposable&#x27;s about a year ago when a local chain store did a 3 packages for 1 sale; &amp; I still have quite a few left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally feel that (at least for me &amp; my friends) we are in the worst economy of my lifetime (well over 50 years) &amp; $6+ monthly on razors is a luxury I can&#x27;t afford. If your financial situation is stable &amp; you have disposable income, this is an excellent razor; but again I consider the cartridge lifespan/price combo to be a horrible value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now back to the original 3/7/13 review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will openly admit that like many others, this economy has had a severe impact on my entire life &amp; lifestyle, &amp; these days I approach many of these reviews as not only based on quality but more so on a price to quality ratio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the good: This is the closest shave I have ever had from a powered razor, hands down. I also haven&#x27;t had the problems with the battery cover flying off that other reviewers have reported.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the not so good:&lt;br /&gt;During my first shave I had quite a bit of stubble due to using the mediocre [[ASIN:B008KEJ1US Panasonic ES-SL41-W electric razor]] I reviewed in November. The Gillette literally pulled the stubble out. It hurt. That did not happen today on my second shave, where I started with much less beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My razor came with no documentation. Based on the thoroughness of a couple of the other reviews, I have to assume that either those reviewers received different packaging than I did, or were extremely familiar with this razor line already. One thing I found quite helpful in one of the reviews was a the statement, \\&quot;Do not be fooled by the changing of the green or blue strip at the top of the cartridge: I&#x27;ve found that I can get at least 3 more shaves after that&#x27;s turned white.\\&quot; That apparently is when Gillette suggests changing the blade, &amp; mine came with nothing stating that. Part of the issue is there are numerous languages on the package; &amp; as such there isn&#x27;t room to say much of anything in any of them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another concern is what is the best way to clean the cartridge without causing it to get dull as a result? Running water does NOT do the job. I may use the old toothbrush method, but at this price a small instruction manual should have been included. I also don&#x27;t know how to change the cartridge, though I assume it&#x27;s not rocket science!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Edit 3/8/13: I found a faq on the Gillette site re: cleaning. They state never use a cloth or brush, but run water from behind the blades. While that works better than running water from the front, it doesn&#x27;t do the job. They also refuse to state how long a cartridge is likely to last; they don&#x27;t even give a range.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also don&#x27;t like that it&#x27;s made in China. Not for political reasons, but due to the lack of oversight in China of unhealthy substances that have all too frequently been found in consumer products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the bottom line is going to be how long the cartridge lasts, &amp; whether the razor is a good value as a result. (Added 3/20: 2 weeks, &amp; no it isn&#x27;t)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum up: 5 stars for a close shave; 1 star for lack of documentation, the stubble pulling; &amp; the short cartridge lifespan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum up: 5 stars for a close shave; 1 star for lack of documentation, the stubble pulling; &amp; the short cartridge lifespan.</li>
            <li> A vibrating razor???  Really?????  Apparently the Gillette Mach3 is a rehash of a previous vibrating Gillette razor and in all honesty, I don&#x27;t see the point of the vibrations.  Now, the seedy corners of my mind want me to delve into an area of shaving certain body parts wherein vibrations would be very, um, exciting, but I&#x27;m going to refrain from such sophomoric desires and attempt to take a serious shot at reviewing this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To begin with, installing the included battery is easy.  Simply slide open the handle of the razor, pop in the battery, and close it back up.  That&#x27;s all there is to it.  This is where the pros come to an end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons include a somewhat poorly designed handle.  The button that turns on the vibrations is conveniently placed where I normally apply pressure with my thumb, and while it hasn&#x27;t happened often, I have accidentally turned off the vibrating feature.  The handle is also a bit slippery in my hand, especiall when used in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the head of the razor features three blades.  That&#x27;s fine when I&#x27;m shaving my neck and cheeks, but it does a terrible job on my chin and isn&#x27;t good at all when used between my nose and upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the vibrations are supposedly beneficial for people with sensitive skin, which I have.  Unfortunately I have yet to find any benefit whatsover of this gimmick.  In fact, it makes it a bit difficult to feel the blades actually shave my beard except when I use it on my chin and lip.  When used in that particular area, the vibrations actually make the blades pull my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately you&#x27;ll have to try out this razor for yourself, but I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Although I knew this product was a rehashed Gillette razor, I had never used the Mach 3 Turbo when it was released so I figured I&#x27;d try. While shaving my biggest issue was never my face, but the area on my neck where the irritation, razor burn, etc would occur. Now that I have a beard the trouble spot has become my soul problem. In all honesty, this is one of the worst neck shaving razors I have gotten, it did a crap job of removing hair from my neck, even when used with their recommended line of shaving gels. I&#x27;d have to use repetitive, short strokes up my neck just to remove most of it just to have some stubble remain and no close shave. After a few days of irritation flare ups, I switched back to using my Schick Hydro 5 and am currently tampering with the Gillette Fusion and a bottle of the Gillette Foam with Menthol.</li>
            <li> Pretty nice.  Very smooth, no cuts.  Only drawback being the replacement blades cost a fortune and I&#x27;m not sure if the vibration feature really makes all that much of a difference.</li>
