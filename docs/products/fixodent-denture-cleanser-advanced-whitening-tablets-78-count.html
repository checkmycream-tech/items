            <li>Fixodent Advanced Whitening gives me a LOT to Smile about!!</li>
            <li>Overall, a great product to use.</li>
            <li>I found this to be very strong and for some reason melts very slowly...rather use polident for my cleaning of dentures...</li>
            <li>I got this cleanser to clean stains off of my ceramic kitchen knives and it worked like a charm.  </li>
            <li>They clean and whiten twice as well as Polident--even Polident Smokers.</li>
            <li>Got exactly what I ordered at a good price in a very short time, what more can you ask?</li>
            <li>This was competively priced and looks old but is working ok.</li>
            <li>Like is much better than other brands available!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big coffee drinker, and in only one overnight soak so far, my teeth are brilliant.</li>
            <li>cleaned my cycling helmet - 5-gallon bucket, hot water, a handful of the tabs, and a brick to keep the helmet submerged.  </li>
            <li>Now, my sister is &#x27;very&#x27; particular about her appearance</li>
            <li>I ordered 2 large boxes so I will not run out again.</li>
            <li>No false teeth in the household but use these tabs for cleaning vases, etc.  </li>
            <li>thanks for having this</li>
            <li>Always white teeth and fresh breath!</li>
            <li>Truly whitens better than any other product I have tried!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Comes out fresh and clean - minty smell with other tabs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>would recommend highly</li>
            <li>on a very recent appointment with my dentist he commented on how very clean and white</li>
            <li>love this product and it is worth the few extra pennys</li>
            <li>It cleans stains off and makes your smile white again.</li>
            <li>I ordered my new dentures extra&lt;br /&gt;White and expect my cleaning product to keep them like new .</li>
            <li>fixodent advanced&lt;br /&gt;Provides a like new pair of dentures every morning .</li>
            <li>this is the only product that will keep them clean and white and not mess up&lt;br /&gt;the liner.</li>
            <li>Wow, having a warning sign on the tablet pkg caught my attention.</li>
            <li>And I line them with a soft liner myself.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>just what i needed, this will last a long time is worth the money i pay for and it works</li>

            <li> The fixodent brand cleanser is hard to find at the stores around here.  </li>

            <li> This is the best denture cleaner.  Removes stains much better than Polident.</li>
            <li> on a very recent appointment with my dentist he commented on how very clean and white my dentures are,easy to use,timewise.</li>
            <li> Hi, This might sound silly, but I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for this product for about 3 years! When I was ill a few yrs back my sister sent me gifts and packages and one of the &#x27;care-packages&#x27; had this denture whitener in it. Wow, having a warning sign on the tablet pkg caught my attention. (don&#x27;t put your fingers in your mouth after handling tablets, was hands well) Now, my sister is &#x27;very&#x27; particular about her appearance and so I thought, okay, I&#x27;ll try them. YES, the very best whitening and cleanser on the market! I looked everywhere, except Amazon, for a long time. At last! I ordered 2 large boxes so I will not run out again. I&#x27;m a big coffee drinker, and in only one overnight soak so far, my teeth are brilliant. Fixodent Advanced Whitening gives me a LOT to Smile about!! Happy and very pleased!</li>
            <li> Product was as described and it arrived on or before stated date, what more can be said.  I&#x27;m Happy</li>
            <li> No false teeth in the household but use these tabs for cleaning vases, etc.  They are thorough but gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even cleaned my cycling helmet - 5-gallon bucket, hot water, a handful of the tabs, and a brick to keep the helmet submerged.  Comes out fresh and clean - minty smell with other tabs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it on anything that resists dishwasher or scrubbing - think coffee or red wine stains on teeth and go from there.  Overall, a great product to use.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used product yet but box was slightly damaged.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my father and it was fast service and a good buy for the money! would buy again.</li>
            <li> Fixodent white is the best whitener I have used . I ordered my new dentures extra&lt;br /&gt;White and expect my cleaning product to keep them like new . fixodent advanced&lt;br /&gt;Provides a like new pair of dentures every morning . great product very powerful.</li>
            <li> I use this to whiten my dentures, and it does it&#x27;s job very well my dentures come out very white everyday...I am so pleased with this product I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I found this to be very strong and for some reason melts very slowly...rather use polident for my cleaning of dentures...</li>
            <li> really does a good job of whitening my dentures would recommend highly</li>
            <li> Cleans my dentures, but does nothing to remove stains (coffee, etc.)</li>
            <li> Helps with many denture stains! Always white teeth and fresh breath! Would recommend to any denture or partial wearers! Great!</li>
            <li> I got this cleanser to clean stains off of my ceramic kitchen knives and it worked like a charm.  1 packet of the denture cleaner, 1 quart of water, and an overnight soak and they were as white as when I bought them.</li>
            <li> Got exactly what I ordered at a good price in a very short time, what more can you ask?</li>
            <li> Great product works exactly how it&#x27;s supposed too. Took off a lot of the stains and my teeth are really nice. Thank you I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest whitening product for dentures I have found.&lt;br /&gt;Great product and a great value.</li>
            <li> just what i needed, this will last a long time is worth the money i pay for and it works</li>
            <li> I have been using Polident for years and decided to try these as they were much less expensive.  They clean and whiten twice as well as Polident--even Polident Smokers.</li>
            <li> I have tried other denture cleaners and was unimpressed and so I tried Fixodent Advance Whiting and it is the best on the market. It cleans stains off and makes your smile white again. I tell everyone I know with dentures to get this and they have tried it and love it too. It was hard to find in my area so found it on Amazon and at a great price too. Nothing and I mean nothing cleans like this, get and try it and you will never use anything else.</li>
            <li> None better, been using it for years and cant find it in stores so order it here, on a scale 1 to 10 with 10 best, Fixodent is definitely a 10.</li>
            <li> It s the best I have found up to date.</li>
            <li> Truly whitens better than any other product I have tried!&lt;br /&gt;I use it over night and it is noticeable the difference, the&lt;br /&gt;price is not much different but I use it weekly to whiten,&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and it is worth the few extra pennys</li>
            <li> Works well on my bite guard. Like is much better than other brands available!</li>
            <li> I have had the same dentures for 43yrs. And I line them with a soft liner myself.&lt;br /&gt;And this is the only product that will keep them clean and white and not mess up&lt;br /&gt;the liner. To me it&#x27;s a WINNER.</li>
            <li> it works well and does a great job of whitening.</li>
            <li> thanks for having this</li>
            <li> The best on the market.  The only one I will use.</li>
            <li> Very good... nice cleaning.</li>
            <li> The fixodent brand cleanser is hard to find at the stores around here.  I like it better I believe.  This was competively priced and looks old but is working ok.</li>
            <li> Does what it says it will do, works great!  Can&#x27;t find it any where but amazon and at a good price!</li>
