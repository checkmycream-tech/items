            <li> Strange thing: I put this color (Alpine Snow) on my nails, and it pulls away from the edges and pools in the middle.</li>
            <li> I use it for either french manicures or over my base coat and under bright or neon colors to help them pop.  </li>
            <li> Came in earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Wears the same way as any other gel polish that you can buy for $9</li>

            <li> AND USUALLY DO THE FRENCH MANICURE</li>
            <li> Chips, peels, doesn&#x27;t stick to my nails like the other colors.</li>
            <li> this is usually opaque in two coats also</li>
            <li> This is impossible unless you create a clean/opaque base between the two colors so that the darker color doesn&#x27;t show through the lighter color on top.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
