    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I am very happy with these products and will continue to buy them.</li>
            <li>Im happy</li>
            <li>It works great for her.</li>
            <li>would not buy it again found over the counter products just as good for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>Great product- holds color, if done as directed, looks fantastic!</li>
            <li>Also tanners make my freckles much more noticeable.</li>
            <li>They all fit well together.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m light to medium skin tone.</li>
            <li>I applied this lightly and evenly.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>it was ok,not worth the money I paid for it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all right not what I exected</li>
            <li>does exactly what it says, beautiful tan, goes as light or dark as you want with no orange or yellow staining</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sticking with my Fake Bake that works better with great color achievement.</li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t hold up you pretty much had to apply all over again after every shower.</li>
            <li>I liked Fake Bake better.</li>
            <li>No one has noticed my &amp;#34;tan.&amp;#34;  I expected far more from this product with the hefty price tag of $104.90 and the reviews it had received.  </li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and tried using the product several days in a row and hardly achieved any color at all.</li>
            <li>disappointed with all the hype on the product....found it  hard to apply and I was applying on my daughter for prom ...not a good color for fair skin people who stay out of the sun.....</li>
            <li>I also like that it has a fresh citrus smell, not the usual chemical smell that accompanies some self-tanners.</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the usual odor</li>
            <li> but this product is not for me and the 3 bottle set was expensive.</li>
            <li> I like that this product does not have that awful smell that all the other tanning products have and that there are no harmful chemicals in it.  </li>

            <li> Very discouraged; I was so excited after reading the reviews but as an Esthetician I was mislead and wasted my time and money on this line that advertised false promises!</li>
            <li> Turned my skin orange.  I&#x27;m returning the product.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t hold up you pretty much had to apply all over again after every shower. not worth the money</li>
            <li> not what I expected sweats off</li>
            <li> does exactly what it says, beautiful tan, goes as light or dark as you want with no orange or yellow staining</li>
            <li> Im happy I brought the 3 pack. They all fit well together.</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned and tried using the product several days in a row and hardly achieved any color at all. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.  I&#x27;m sticking with my Fake Bake that works better with great color achievement.</li>
            <li> No orange coloring! I also like that it has a fresh citrus smell, not the usual chemical smell that accompanies some self-tanners.</li>
            <li> Great product- holds color, if done as directed, looks fantastic!</li>
            <li> Works well, thank you!</li>
            <li> I just didn&#x27;t like it for me. I liked Fake Bake better. They all work about the same and you have to find what works for you. I gave mine to a friend of mine who LOVES Tan Physics. It works great for her.</li>
            <li> I like that this product does not have that awful smell that all the other tanning products have and that there are no harmful chemicals in it.  I also like the way it goes one and works almost immediately.  I am very happy with these products and will continue to buy them.</li>
            <li> blotchy end result  did not like product at all ....disappointed with all the hype on the product....found it  hard to apply and I was applying on my daughter for prom ...not a good color for fair skin people who stay out of the sun.....</li>
            <li> Goes on evenly, does not smell at all, does not rub off on my clothing either. Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in the Tan Physics Pre-Tan Exfoliator, True Color Sunless Tanner, &amp; Ultra-Hydrating Tan Extender Bundle that was rated #1 in sunless tanners and came with a price of $104.99.  I read the directions carefully and then preceded to use the product as directed.  After several weeks I might be 1 or 2 shades darker.  No one has noticed my &amp;#34;tan.&amp;#34;  I expected far more from this product with the hefty price tag of $104.90 and the reviews it had received.  I will finish using the bottles until empty but will never again trust this web site for products I have never used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m light to medium skin tone. I applied this lightly and evenly. After 1 application my legs were too dark, orangey and streaky.
