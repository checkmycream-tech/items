            <li>Jamaican Black Castor Oil is a wonderful product!</li>

            <li>This is a must have and the price is right.</li>

            <li>Who knows ,it may be exactly what you are looking for.</li>
            <li>it is moisturizing but smells funny like ashes</li>
            <li>It deserves my 5 stars most definitely!</li>
            <li>yes - it is somewhat oily at first introduction to your hair.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and a bit cheaper for me!</li>
            <li>Exactly as promised</li>
            <li>I use it with Coconut oil for a hot oil treatment and use it straight out the bottle on split ends.</li>
            <li>I use it in my 3c/4a hair as a hot oil treatment 3xs a month and mix it with argan, coconut, sweet almond oil and whatever other hair friendly oil I can find.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I really like this oil.  </li>
            <li>and I get it fast</li>
            <li>Thank you for a fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I ordered this all the time from Amazon and get it very promptly.</li>
            <li>Not broken bottles.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Now my hair is growing so fast</li>
            <li>and it really works.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Real mascara.  </li>
            <li>Much, much cheaper</li>
            <li>this stuff qorks its really moisturizing</li>
            <li>very well packed oil and roll  on</li>
            <li>I just received my first order and was surprised to get lavender oil in the roll-on bottle instead of castor oil.  </li>
            <li>During the winter I love to wear my hair in braids and the Jamaican Black Castor Oil helps to prevent thinning of my nap line and helps to thicken my hair from the roots.</li>
            <li>I love jamaican black castor oil</li>
            <li>I love black castor oil.</li>
            <li>I am well pleased with the seller and with my Jamaican Black Castor Oil.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product, this is my second bottle and this time I got a double pack.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products but nothing has worked in such a short period of time.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>There are many pros and little cons.</li>
            <li>It really grows thick healthy hair where there was none.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>It does keep my hair soft throughout the day.</li>
            <li>So far I like this product.</li>
            <li>Is really good for hair growth especially when you have thin hair.  </li>
            <li>Has made my hair so thick and soft, love it.</li>
            <li>It arrived before the expected date and the price is very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft and fine (3c) and has a tendency to dry out after a few hours.</li>
            <li>so I buy several brands as long as they are 100% / pure castor.  </li>
            <li>You should  definitely purchase an application bottle to use this product so that it is applied directly to your scalp.</li>
            <li>Makes an my hair soft only been using it for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>Thus far this castor oil has grown my hair one inch in a short period of time.</li>
            <li>I purchased 4 more for friends because they were amazed how long my hair has grown and how thick it is after using this every week for 6 months.</li>
            <li>This product did exactly what the previous reviews stated for hair growth.</li>
            <li>This oil has a bit of strong smell and it is very thick but will use it in oil packs.  </li>
            <li>I really like it, helps with restoring thickness to my edges, but has a slight smell to it.</li>
            <li>and now I have really thick &amp; long lashes without mascara and fabulous lashes when I do put on my Benefits</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I just received my first order and was surprised to get lavender oil in the roll-on bottle instead of castor oil.  </li>
            <li> During the winter I love to wear my hair in braids and the Jamaican Black Castor Oil helps to prevent thinning of my nap line and helps to thicken my hair from the roots.</li>
            <li> I love jamaican black castor oil</li>
            <li> I love black castor oil.</li>
            <li> I am well pleased with the seller and with my Jamaican Black Castor Oil.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, this is my second bottle and this time I got a double pack.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products but nothing has worked in such a short period of time.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> There are many pros and little cons.</li>
            <li> It really grows thick healthy hair where there was none.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> It does keep my hair soft throughout the day.</li>
            <li> So far I like this product.</li>
            <li> Is really good for hair growth especially when you have thin hair.  </li>
            <li> Has made my hair so thick and soft, love it.</li>
            <li> It arrived before the expected date and the price is very reasonable.  </li>
            <li> My hair is soft and fine (3c) and has a tendency to dry out after a few hours.</li>
            <li> so I buy several brands as long as they are 100% / pure castor.  </li>
            <li> You should  definitely purchase an application bottle to use this product so that it is applied directly to your scalp.</li>
            <li> Makes an my hair soft only been using it for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Thus far this castor oil has grown my hair one inch in a short period of time.</li>
            <li> I purchased 4 more for friends because they were amazed how long my hair has grown and how thick it is after using this every week for 6 months.</li>
            <li> This product did exactly what the previous reviews stated for hair growth.</li>
            <li> This oil has a bit of strong smell and it is very thick but will use it in oil packs.  </li>
            <li> I really like it, helps with restoring thickness to my edges, but has a slight smell to it.</li>
            <li> and now I have really thick &amp; long lashes without mascara and fabulous lashes when I do put on my Benefits</li>
            <li> the oil is thick enough to last a few days end keeps my hair from becoming too frizzy</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> so this will last a long time.</li>
            <li> The little bottle of perfumed oil could&#x27;ve been left out as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> Do not mix with any other oils but just put it in a applicator 4ozs bottle and a new empty mascara for the eyes.</li>
            <li> One of the bottles were loose so a third of the product leaked.</li>
            <li> Has my hair growing thick and fast.</li>
            <li> have used NUMEROUS brands of Regular Castor and Black Castor Oil -</li>
            <li> Simply mix other olive, jojoba or another oil to ease the sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I ordered Black Jamacan Castor Oil  and received regular Castor oil in Jamaican castor oil bottles....</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not really vexed over it.</li>
            <li> Did not received the small container, only the 2 bottles</li>
            <li> Some other uses are: cuts, burns, aches, moisturizer for skin, and massage oil.</li>
            <li> I applied a thin layer of the Jamaican Black Castor Oil several nights to my eye brows and within one week my eyebrows grew back and thicker than ever before.</li>
            <li> I know several people have omitted this item in a common hair product recipe, due to the cost.  </li>
            <li> just look for 100% or pure and you can&#x27;t go wrong with either type or brand.</li>
            <li> It grows your hair like it say it will, by the product being so thick you only need a little at a time.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be the black castor oil in the container...</li>
            <li> online for ways to incorporate Jamaican Black Castor Oil in your hair routine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten used to using products with black castor oil, so decided to buy some to use alone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit disappointed that the free roll on bottle did not come with castor oil, but with Egyptian musk oil.</li>
            <li> mad my hair so soft the next day,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and requires only a small amount.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t get the little bottle that shows in the picture</li>
            <li> Its a little think</li>
            <li> I have been using if for a few days</li>
            <li> I put it in a plastic bottle with a nozzle and heat it up in the microwave for 25-30 seconds and then have my husband massage this into my scalp since he is heavy handed</li>
            <li> I the Jamaican Black Castor Oil never disappoints!  </li>
            <li> This oil is thick and not runny, if you don’t like the smell or thickness you can mix with other carrier</li>
            <li> First, I would like to say the smell wasn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
            <li> The Black Castor oil isn&#x27;t so bad, it stinks, it leaves my hair feeling healthy.</li>
            <li> Very little change in my hair, and</li>
            <li> The bottles were also plastic and the product was thinner than what im used to, usually when I order jbco it comes in a glass bottle.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately im lazy with returning things</li>
            <li> Just use a small amount across the brows and after a few nights, bam!  </li>
            <li> I also put it (by itself) on a genetically passed down thin spot at the temple --</li>
            <li> the women who did the threading made my eyebrows too thin and uneven.</li>
            <li> It helps to thick it up.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick because of this.</li>
            <li> Awfully thick and very hard to apply to the hair which is why I purchased them.</li>
            <li> This oil performed wonders on growing back my badly waxed eyebrows</li>
            <li> My mother has thin eyebrows and applies some on hers to help thicken her brows.</li>
            <li> It helped, but the taste is awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I always order this product from Amazon. I use it to thicken my eyelashes and brows, my hairline and scalp. Do not mix with any other oils but just put it in a applicator 4ozs bottle and a new empty mascara for the eyes. Great product!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! It really grows thick healthy hair where there was none. Fast shipping! Thank you!$</li>
            <li> This stuff is the real deal. My hair loves it.</li>
            <li> The perfume stunk. One of the bottles were loose so a third of the product leaked. The bottles were also plastic and the product was thinner than what im used to, usually when I order jbco it comes in a glass bottle. Unfortunately im lazy with returning things so it made a great last minute regift.</li>
            <li> This is the second time that I&#x27;ve ordered this product. Absolutely love it. During the winter I love to wear my hair in braids and the Jamaican Black Castor Oil helps to prevent thinning of my nap line and helps to thicken my hair from the roots. Several weeks ago, I had my eye brows threaded and the women who did the threading made my eyebrows too thin and uneven. I applied a thin layer of the Jamaican Black Castor Oil several nights to my eye brows and within one week my eyebrows grew back and thicker than ever before. I highly recommend this product. Amazon has the best deals on this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil.  It does have a smoky smell but you get used to it.</li>
            <li> First, I would like to say the smell wasn&#x27;t that bad. I could actually stand the smell once I mixed it with my leave in conditioner. I have been using if for a few days so right now I don&#x27;t see the results. Overall, I am highly satisfied with the product itself and would recommend this to anyone who asks about it.</li>
            <li> A great product and I am so glad that I found out about this one. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the smell.</li>
            <li> Very happy with product</li>
            <li> This product did exactly what the previous reviews stated for hair growth. I had a chemical burn for over a year ,this is the only thing that started my hair back growing! Great product!</li>
            <li> I USED THIS IN MY HAIR PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. It keeps my hair soft and manageable. I was apprehensive about the reviews about the smell but it wasn&#x27;t off-putting at all. I ordered two so that I could give one to my Dad and he never puts anything in his hair, so that was a miracle, to see him actually use it. You should  definitely purchase an application bottle to use this product so that it is applied directly to your scalp. I have noticed repair to my hair from braids that I had which damaged my hair. My hair is growing back, and breakage is minimum. All in all I love this product and you should try it. Who knows ,it may be exactly what you are looking for. The body was definitely a pleasant smell. Thank you Tropic Isle. I will recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is perfection, I love it.</li>
            <li> Fells great on my skin and hair.</li>
            <li> The Black Castor oil isn&#x27;t so bad, it stinks, it leaves my hair feeling healthy. They gave me a roll on stick, but it was Egyptian musk.... I thought it would be the black castor oil in the container... so that part was misleading.</li>
            <li> Was very pleased with product, packaging, and delivery. Will definitely order again</li>
            <li> Makes an my hair soft only been using it for 2 weeks. Hopefully i see big results in couple weeks</li>
            <li> The actual product is great. Only problem i can think of is that there is a roller bottle pictured but i didn&#x27;t get it. It wasnt in the description so I&#x27;m not really vexed over it. I&#x27;d 100% buy this item again!</li>
            <li> I love this it is moisturizing but smells funny like ashes but it a miracle product :)</li>
            <li> It helped, but the taste is awful.</li>
            <li> My hair has grown tremendously because of this oil. I purchased 4 more for friends because they were amazed how long my hair has grown and how thick it is after using this every week for 6 months.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try to order in bulk since I use this almost every night to oil my scalp.  Lasted about 3 months.  I put it in a plastic bottle with a nozzle and heat it up in the microwave for 25-30 seconds and then have my husband massage this into my scalp since he is heavy handed it feels great. Perfect way to fall asleep!!!!  Has my hair growing thick and fast.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff.  I use it in my handcrafted hair and body butters.  Amazon has the best price and the quality is far from lacking.  I know several people have omitted this item in a common hair product recipe, due to the cost.  But Amazon makes it possible for me and I do see better results when this is in the hair butter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and it&#x27;s pretty good. It&#x27;s thick and requires only a small amount. It does keep my hair soft throughout the day. My hair is soft and fine (3c) and has a tendency to dry out after a few hours. It was a good deal ($19.35) for this size. I also love the sample of roll on body oil. It smells great.The scent doesn&#x27;t last long but it leaves you smelling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I liked how they wrap it there was no way it was going to brake and I get it fast, The product is great. Will be ordering it again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Great product, great size and value. I would recommend this product and seller to anyone. Thank you for a fast delivery.</li>
            <li> The best there is, Its a must try</li>

            <li> Really great price so this will last a long time. Really love the scented oil that came with it and will be using it as my perfume! And came very fast. It deserves my 5 stars most definitely!</li>
            <li> Very little change in my hair, and I use it regular.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Great for skin as well as hair growth. Always arrive on time from manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Works fine, but... yes - it is somewhat oily at first introduction to your hair. What I have found to work for me is that I</li>
            <li> It grows your hair like it say it will, by the product being so thick you only need a little at a time. I happen to have the hair care line Tropic Isle Living for my hair and it works wonders for my hair.</li>

            <li> I really like this product.  I actually received it sooner than I expected, which is great!</li>

            <li> I love this products.  I have been using it for years.  Is really good for hair growth especially when you have thin hair.  It helps to thick it up.</li>
            <li> Jamaican Black Castor Oil is a wonderful product! There are many pros and little cons. However pros definitely outweigh the cons. There are many uses for castor oil, but I use the oil for my hair. My mother has thin eyebrows and applies some on hers to help thicken her brows. Some other uses are: cuts, burns, aches, moisturizer for skin, and massage oil. I keep 4 bottles in the house at all times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Softer hair&lt;br /&gt;2. Stronger hair&lt;br /&gt;3. Minimum shedding&lt;br /&gt;4. Hair growth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Smell is not all the great&lt;br /&gt;2. Oil is thick&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look online for ways to incorporate Jamaican Black Castor Oil in your hair routine. There are many uses for this product.</li>
            <li> Has made my hair so thick and soft, love it.</li>
            <li> I just received my first order and was surprised to get lavender oil in the roll-on bottle instead of castor oil.  There was no phone number on the receipt but I wish I had received the correct oil.  It was a big reason for my placing this order because I thought the roller would be so helpful.</li>
            <li> Great working product!</li>
            <li> I love it. Great price.</li>
            <li> This is the staple of our household homemade face and body creams. Used in the right amounts with Shea butter and added essential oils which also makes it smell better we are very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Great deal !! Love this product this price is wonderful</li>
            <li> Great product. Excellent delivery time.</li>
            <li> Has helped thicken my hair and with my dreads getting longer and heavier, this was a huge help.</li>
            <li> Did not get the musk with it and the smell is not the best but durable</li>
            <li> Curly hair use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is amazing!  I use it in my 3c/4a hair as a hot oil treatment 3xs a month and mix it with argan, coconut, sweet almond oil and whatever other hair friendly oil I can find. Now my hair is growing so fast, it&#x27;s actually kinda freaky.  I also put it (by itself) on a genetically passed down thin spot at the temple -- hair grew back thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eyebrow &amp; eyelash use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, if you have thin or over plucked eye brows, it is fantastic for growing them.  Just use a small amount across the brows and after a few nights, bam!  A stylist at Damone Roberts taught me that trick and it really works. Out of sheer curiosity, I also started using it on my eyelashes and now I have really thick &amp; long lashes without mascara and fabulous lashes when I do put on my Benefits It&#x27;s Real mascara.  Much, much cheaper then the Diorshow mascara primer. Lol</li>
            <li> Great product helps with thickness of hair</li>
            <li> It seams to work for my hair losse. I hope win the battle of los my hair after a quimio a year ago.</li>
            <li> I love jamaican black castor oil this stuff qorks its really moisturizing</li>
            <li> Thus far this castor oil has grown my hair one inch in a short period of time. It has also recovered my bald spots in the front of my hair line.</li>
            <li> I the Jamaican Black Castor Oil never disappoints!  The little bottle of perfumed oil could&#x27;ve been left out as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> Love it seeing so much improvement in my hair and my faughters</li>
            <li> mad my hair so soft the next day, been oiling every night and my hair has changed its only been three days!</li>
            <li> Worth the buy!!  I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> I just love this oil I use it EVERY Day on my hair and my child (almost time to reorder some more)</li>
            <li> Excellent product worth the experience</li>
            <li> I love black castor oil. I use it with Coconut oil for a hot oil treatment and use it straight out the bottle on split ends.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I used this on my feet before i go to work and by the end of the day my feet don&#x27;t ache. Great product for African American hair also.</li>
            <li> Love this product, a must have. My dreads are nice and healthy.</li>
            <li> A wonderful product.  have recommended to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I stand by this stuff! Fast delivery and a bit cheaper for me! Great buy! I didn&#x27;t get that lol roll on thing tho..</li>
            <li> Love this stuff use it all the time to make my hair cream!!  Also has healing properties for aching bodies, my mom used it and said it worked good on her back.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, this is my second bottle and this time I got a double pack. I has helped my thinning edges regrow along with the rest of my hair. I have tried many products but nothing has worked in such a short period of time. Along with proper hair and using this product you will definitely see results. The smell is pleasant, I use it four times a week. I mix the castor oil with tea tree, carrot , and coconut oil and the results have been amazing. This is a must have and the price is right.</li>
            <li> Awfully thick and very hard to apply to the hair which is why I purchased them.</li>
            <li> Love jamaican castor oil.</li>
            <li> I got the 2 bottles but I didn&#x27;t get the little bottle that shows in the picture</li>
            <li> I am a natural and I love this product. My hair is thick because of this. And the packaging was awesome</li>
            <li> This thing grows hair like magic. It permanently solved my toddler&#x27;s hair loss at the temples. Her hair has grown beautifully and healthily! I&#x27;ve started to use it around my temples too.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and it performed as stated.</li>
            <li> I really like it, helps with restoring thickness to my edges, but has a slight smell to it.</li>
            <li> This oil has so many uses - but I use this on my scalp. This is wonderful for hair growth and strengthening plus it&#x27;s a great moisturizer! Just rub this on the scalp a couple of times a day and you will be AMAZED! This oil is thick and not runny, if you don’t like the smell or thickness you can mix with other carrier oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a severe hair loss issue and using this oil helped me grow my hair back in a couple of months! Consistency is the KEY! I LOVE it and would highly recommend it to anyone. If you find yourself getting bumps on your scalp, undiluted may be too strong for you.  Simply mix other olive, jojoba or another oil to ease the sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used NUMEROUS brands of Regular Castor and Black Castor Oil - just look for 100% or pure and you can&#x27;t go wrong with either type or brand. I have indeed posted reviews on different brands because I have used these brands.  I use castor oil on my hair and my daughters’ hair and I mix my own hair products so I buy several brands as long as they are 100% / pure castor.  I hope this review helps!!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this oil. My hair is starting to grow back. I have sprouting hair. :)</li>
            <li> I am well pleased with the seller and with my Jamaican Black Castor Oil.  It arrived before the expected date and the price is very reasonable.  I&#x27;ve used the oil several times since its arrival and I love how it makes may scalp feel.  If you are on the fence about this product, it&#x27;s time to get off.  This is a keeper. I will definitely reorder!!!</li>
            <li> Nice size and the roll on smells good. Gave it to my husband.</li>
            <li> They are super awesome love them about to start using.</li>
            <li> This oil performed wonders on growing back my badly waxed eyebrows so I can start fresh with a full brow👌 combined it with a bit of coconut cream as was suggested in a utube video re growing back one&#x27;s eyebrows!</li>
            <li> quick shipping and great product thanks</li>
            <li> awesome product, will continue to purchase, really good for hair growth and skin issues, makes hands and feet very smooth</li>
            <li> Love it!!!! Will buy again</li>
            <li> This oil has a bit of strong smell and it is very thick but will use it in oil packs.  I&#x27;m a bit disappointed that the free roll on bottle did not come with castor oil, but with Egyptian musk oil.</li>
            <li> Great and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Great product for those needing unscented to very little scent in products as I do. This has a very pleasant smell that I am able to tolerate on my hair.</li>
            <li> So far I like this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten used to using products with black castor oil, so decided to buy some to use alone. I am loving it! Exactly as promised</li>
