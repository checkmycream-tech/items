    <ol>
            <li>and she was really impressed too!</li>
            <li>but once you get the hang of it ...Soooo wonderful!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I am so happy I tried these products and thank the ladies who said if you can polish your nails you can do this yourself!  </li>
            <li>This is the best stuff ever!</li>
            <li>My nails look awesome.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy CND came up with this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it, and it works like it is supposed to - my nails look great!</li>
            <li>I am hooked, best thing on the market for nails.</li>
            <li>With the CND Shellac system I get two weeks of perfect, chip-free wear.  </li>
            <li>Lasted over a week and with the way she plays, is great!</li>
            <li>it is just like painting your nails, and once you get the hang of the coat thickness/edge-to tip it is flawless in application and wear.</li>
            <li>My nails always look so good!  </li>
            <li>great stuff keep nail polish on.</li>
            <li>GREAT stuff.  </li>
            <li>Great shape and works good.</li>
            <li>but since I&#x27;ve been using the shellac system my nails got stronger and look more beautiful then ever.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>Now we want more colors!</li>
            <li>My nails look better then EVER!</li>
            <li>I started taking gelatin a month before I used Shellac, the results of the polish were amazing.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased to see that Shellac gel nail polish is available to purchase because I was spending 2 to 2.5 hrs every 2 to 3 weeks and paying the money to have a salon manicure - with great results mind you, but who has that kind of time?</li>
            <li>I received exactly what I ordered - which is great, considering you sometimes never know what you may end up getting.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was stunned at how easy it was to have nice looking fingernails.  </li>
            <li>Love this product and the fact that I can do  apply it myself at home instead of having to go to a salon.  </li>
            <li>I love the ease and longetivity of the shellac nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I came home and did some research and was encouraged by how many ladies here on amazon.com were doing this procedure themselves.  </li>
            <li>, I can not go 21 days, it is more like 14.</li>
            <li>I bought a UV light here on Amazon and do my own CND shellac.  </li>
            <li>If you love it, get a home set up.</li>
            <li>and then the top coat.</li>
            <li>Gave it as a gift they love it -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --</li>
            <li>my kids love it and adorable everyone love it when they see it.</li>
            <li>CND you get more for the money.</li>
            <li>I have been using Shellac for over 2 years now &amp; absolutely love this polish.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li>I have been purchasing shellac products for home (non-professional) use for about a year now, and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>My nails are healthy, and with the shellac&#x27;s strength on my nails I have been able to grow them to lengths I have never managed before.</li>
            <li>will buy more, good product, very detail and presentable.</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life my nails look nice for more than a day</li>
            <li>This is so cool!</li>
            <li>I am so very pleased with these products an for being able to have nice nails finally!</li>
            <li>CND does the best, if you DO try other brands, just pay attention to the price of the bottle for the amount of product in the bottle...</li>
            <li>also wanted to mention how easy this system is to do it yourself.</li>
            <li>The shellac has an easy learning curve-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this unless you have strong opinions otherwise.</li>
            <li>This system is not only for those who like to keep the nail polish beautiful for a minimum of 2 weeks, but also for those who like to let their nails grow longer and stronger.  </li>
            <li>I can finally have beautiful nails as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>First thing the REAL stuff works great.</li>
            <li>I do my nails every Sunday and have found the best approach is to use whatever inexpensive nail polish color you want (I paint in little designs and stripes sometime</li>
            <li>and there is usually a huge chunk my nail gone</li>
            <li>Is it the polish or the light?</li>
            <li>and of course the UV light.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the nail polish and UV light and followed my manicurist&#x27;s instructions and this stuff is not setting up like it did at the salon.</li>
            <li>Does not harden with uv light..</li>
            <li>Check out the wattage that shellac requires and get a light.  </li>
            <li>It does not need to be the \\&quot;official\\&quot; CND light.  </li>
            <li>I received POWER POLISH that must cured under Uv light.  </li>
            <li>The product is as described!Seems to be original.</li>
            <li>It goes on like nail polish and dries under the light so quickly.</li>
            <li>You can also clean up your mistakes with rubbing alcohol BEFORE you cook it</li>
            <li>(Except for the trained professional part, the DIY nail painter is more than qualified!)</li>
            <li>It does have special removal instructions, the special curing lamp, and all steps are required to do a shellac manicure, but it is a fraction of the cost to do the manicures at home.</li>
            <li>Great products, need to be careful not to get on the skin though.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t enjoy the removal process, but the savings is worth it.</li>
            <li>and it is into the quick in this area.  </li>
            <li>I love how long it lasts and it&#x27;s really easy!</li>
            <li>Seeing some mixed reviews on here, but I thought it was a pretty good nail polish.</li>
            <li>A little thicker than regular nail polish, but once you get used to it, its easy to use and works great!</li>
            <li>Make sure that the polish you use is completely dry before moving to the top coat or you will get wrinkles.</li>
            <li>CND scrub fresh (nail cleaner),</li>
            <li>have been happier doing my own nails- so many times the salons do a shoddy job anyway...)</li>
            <li>This arrived a whole week before the estimated!</li>
            <li>I love using this polish and when I have completed the polishing, I know that it will last for days.</li>
            <li>But not all sellers are equal, make sure you review who you are purchasing from.  </li>
            <li>and they always brake up when they reach certain length,</li>
            <li>I only leave it on for two weeks at a time because my nails are now so strong and grow so fast.  </li>
            <li>This holds up very well.</li>
            <li>You also will need incidentals such as cuticle remover, manicure tools, lint free wipes, orange sticks, and aluminum foil.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even tied this with normal polish and used the CND shellac top coat to make my normal polish last longer before chipping.</li>
            <li>When i am in a big hurry I use this and two top coats with no color for just a clear polish look.</li>
            <li>I will say that with my job I am hard on my nails and getting them to last tendays between redoing was just great.  </li>
            <li>Several years ago I injured my thumbnail on my right hand and lost the nail.  </li>
            <li>(I chose negligee which is clear with a little sparkle) and  a coat of the top coat</li>
            <li>I have very soft nails</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, although a little time consuming.</li>
            <li>Regardless of how long I left the uv light on, it just never seemed to \\&quot;set\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>The whole process takes a while, but it has become part of my forced relaxation time! :)</li>
            <li>I have used Shellac about 5 times once every two weeks and had it applied professionally.</li>
            <li>The last two digits of my fingers itch so much that I&#x27;ve had to take polish off</li>
            <li>/&gt;You really need the following products:  acetone, 91% alcohol,</li>
            <li>My manicurist is trying to return the productt to the manufacturer but so far she has been refused.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using the Negligee color as I like the natural look.  </li>
            <li>I bought this base coat along with the top coat and just use my own polish.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m stuck with a bottle of knockoff and bare nails till a new bottle</li>
            <li>all this time later I need the new bottle</li>
            <li>I have gotten to where I use a regular base coat, regular color polish and the shellac top coat for easiest application and a good long wear.  </li>
            <li>I made that mistake early on and it pulled off a deep layer of my nails</li>
            <li>and it is no harder than just painting your nails.  </li>
            <li>Does not dry well without.</li>
            <li>, I wish I had, Its been far to long for me to even try and get anything out of the sellers.</li>
            <li>Gel ruins your nails because they have to be totally filed across the whole nail every time you use it.  </li>
            <li>I can tell a difference in my nails after only a few months, they are healthier looking, the split in my thumb is gone, and for the first time I can have all my  nails be the same length even though they are still short.&lt;br</li>

            <li> , I wish I had, Its been far to long for me to even try and get anything out of the sellers.</li>
            <li> Gel ruins your nails because they have to be totally filed across the whole nail every time you use it.  </li>
            <li> I can tell a difference in my nails after only a few months, they are healthier looking, the split in my thumb is gone, and for the first time I can have all my  nails be the same length even though they are still short.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought the top, base, color coat, and the curing light for less than $60.</li>
            <li> My nails were soft, short and flaking off,a mess.  </li>
            <li> (I have very flimsy nails, they bend/snap easily usually.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving 5 stars to the whole Shellac system (Base Coat, Color Coat and Top Coat) as it only works when used together.  </li>
            <li> Plus the liquid was far to thin to be the real stuff.  </li>
            <li> Takes a uv lamp to dry</li>
            <li> Since it grew back there is a red line almost dead center that goes from the tip to the cuticle.  </li>
            <li> I dry all with UV light as you would shellac, but the regular base and regular colors are easier for me to apply plus I get a wider variety of color.</li>
            <li> and it will give me a few extra days.  </li>
            <li> and I had absolutely no problem applying them.  </li>
            <li> Its what I expected</li>
            <li> Absolutely no problems.  </li>
            <li> Need to carefully follow instructions.  </li>
            <li> They are soft  covered with white streaks  and painful because they are so soft.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used the product yet because I am waiting for the other products to use with it.</li>
            <li> (those ordered from other vendors)</li>
            <li> I had the same thing happen in the past with another shipper</li>
            <li> and I have tried other shellac-gel-type polishes.  </li>
            <li> IT WAS SO  SMALL COULD USES ONLY 2X</li>
            <li> The .25oz bottles of base and top coat last me about 7 months of doing my nails every 2 weeks, and a few friends&#x27; manicures as well.(I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bought Shellac CND base coat back in march because my first bottle (bought from someone else) started to run low</li>
            <li> It does stay on your nails and doesn&#x27;t chip and lasts about two weeks, but the consequences are not worth it.</li>
            <li> CND base coat, CND color coat, CND top coat, CND SolarOil</li>
            <li> From start to finish it takes less than an hour to do your nails.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s must less obnoxious than nail polish remover.  </li>
            <li> They grow just a little and then start peeling away.</li>
            <li> Also, to remove the polish just pour a little remover (WITH acetone) in the cap, soak your finger for about 45 seconds and use a cottonball- not tissue or tp, etc.</li>
            <li> and I had a little money on hand.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It was delivered within a few days, and was in a bubble-wrapped box.</li>
            <li> This base coat works with the full shellac system, but be careful not to apply too thick or it will blotch and lump.  </li>
            <li> so I  was careful when ordering this time but was still MISLEAD!!!!</li>
            <li> I will say that the base coat makes the whole thing a LOT easier to remove, but for me, it&#x27;s still not worth it for me.</li>
            <li> Only used once because the stupid uv lamp broke but the shallac worked on my kid.  </li>
            <li> Base Coat, cook for 10 seconds, one coat cook for 2 minutes, second coat cook for 2 minutes,top coat cook for 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I was sick of having a sore thumb all the time and felt that it was dangerous to have an open sore all the time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all brands of gel nail polish, and Shellac&#x27;s brand is the least destructive to the nail, lasts the longest and is the easiest to remove.</li>
            <li> Expensive investment up front</li>
            <li> They are also very thin to the point they are almost see through on the tips.</li>
            <li> A VERY thin coat is needed.  </li>
            <li> Base coat\\&quot; does, but it works for me.</li>
            <li> I have stopped using the base coat because it was preventing my nails from drying/ curing fully.</li>
            <li> The item I ordered advertised stated \\&quot;CND COSMETICS SHELLAC GAL NAIL POLISH Uv BASE COAT\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I removed it with acetone as directed and found my nails in terrible condition.</li>
            <li> I have had HORRIBLE itching after doing my nails.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The product is legit but I ended up just giving the polish away! I chose not to try to do Shellac and if I want it done, I&#x27;ll just get it done at a shop</li>
            <li> great stuff keep nail polish on.</li>
            <li> So hooked on this product line. I&#x27;m a nurse who is always having to wash my hands and a regular manicure would just chip in days. This holds up very well. When i am in a big hurry I use this and two top coats with no color for just a clear polish look. Remember this product must be UV cured.</li>
            <li> Love this product and the fact that I can do  apply it myself at home instead of having to go to a salon.  Doing it myself saves me over $500 a year!</li>
            <li> I have used Shellac about 5 times once every two weeks and had it applied professionally. The last time I had it applied  the manicurist noticed some white patches on my nails and advised me to stop using it. I removed it with acetone as directed and found my nails in terrible condition. They are soft  covered with white streaks  and painful because they are so soft. I would not recommend this product to anyone. It does stay on your nails and doesn&#x27;t chip and lasts about two weeks, but the consequences are not worth it.</li>
            <li> This is not the same product used in salons.  I purchased this because I searched for gel polish and this is what came up.  But the box says it wears like gel and it doesn&#x27;t.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This is so cool! I love how long it lasts and it&#x27;s really easy! It goes on like nail polish and dries under the light so quickly. All you have to do is follow the instructions to the letter. (Except for the trained professional part, the DIY nail painter is more than qualified!) I took it to work and did my friends nails there and she was really impressed too! Now we want more colors!</li>
            <li> I love the ease and longetivity of the shellac nails.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the CND product for a year .&lt;br /&gt;Lately I have had HORRIBLE itching after doing my nails.  The last two digits of my fingers itch so much that I&#x27;ve had to take polish off immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has anyone else had this problem?  Is it the polish or the light?</li>
            <li> Takes a uv lamp to dry but once you get the hang of it ...Soooo wonderful!  Stays on approx. 2 to 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have never had a manicure or pedicure nor have I ever had any type of nails-acrylic or anything else. I have never bitten my nails. My entire life I have had peeling nails.  They grow just a little and then start peeling away. They are also very thin to the point they are almost see through on the tips. I have tried virtually every nail cure and vitamin on the market to no avail. Several years ago I injured my thumbnail on my right hand and lost the nail.  Since it grew back there is a red line almost dead center that goes from the tip to the cuticle.  This line cracks as soon as it passes the nail bed and there is usually a huge chunk my nail gone and it is into the quick in this area.  I have been to a dermatologist who has said there was nothing they could do to help.  I was sick of having a sore thumb all the time and felt that it was dangerous to have an open sore all the time.  So, I consulted the nail lady at my hair salon.  She suggested the CND Shellac process and gave me the specifics and the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came home and did some research and was encouraged by how many ladies here on amazon.com were doing this procedure themselves.  I went to the CND website where they show all their products and even have videos to watch and instructions you can print out!  I tallied up the cost of the products I would have to purchase and found they were about the same price I would have to pay to have it done only three times!  I was sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really need the following products:  acetone, 91% alcohol, CND scrub fresh (nail cleaner), CND base coat, CND color coat, CND top coat, CND SolarOil and of course the UV light.  You also will need incidentals such as cuticle remover, manicure tools, lint free wipes, orange sticks, and aluminum foil.  All of these products can be purchased here on amazon.com!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was stunned at how easy it was to have nice looking fingernails.  I will say that with my job I am hard on my nails and getting them to last tendays between redoing was just great.  Sometimes I will reapply a coat of color (I chose negligee which is clear with a little sparkle) and  a coat of the top coat and it will give me a few extra days.  From start to finish it takes less than an hour to do your nails.  I can tell a difference in my nails after only a few months, they are healthier looking, the split in my thumb is gone, and for the first time I can have all my  nails be the same length even though they are still short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note of warning:  Do not be tempted to \\&quot;peel\\&quot; off the shellac when it is time to redo. I made that mistake early on and it pulled off a deep layer of my nails and I had to cut my nails off and start over!  Following instruction is the key to mistake proof nails with CND Shellac.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy I tried these products and thank the ladies who said if you can polish your nails you can do this yourself!  You indeed can!  I am so very pleased with these products an for being able to have nice nails finally!</li>
            <li> I was paying $30 every two weeks for a shellac manicure at a salon. I bought the top, base, color coat, and the curing light for less than $60. It&#x27;s easy to apply, although a little time consuming. I don&#x27;t enjoy the removal process, but the savings is worth it. Sooner or later I&#x27;ll learn to give myself the French that I like so well.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased to see that Shellac gel nail polish is available to purchase because I was spending 2 to 2.5 hrs every 2 to 3 weeks and paying the money to have a salon manicure - with great results mind you, but who has that kind of time? I purchased the nail polish and UV light and followed my manicurist&#x27;s instructions and this stuff is not setting up like it did at the salon.</li>
            <li> Does not harden with uv light..</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used the product yet because I am waiting for the other products to use with it. (those ordered from other vendors) This arrived a whole week before the estimated!</li>
            <li> This product has ruined my nails.  After having it applied three different times, my nails began to split and peel.  My manicurist is trying to return the productt to the manufacturer but so far she has been refused.  I definitely would NOT recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff ever! Doesn&#x27;t chip and lasts for 2 weeks just like they say.  Don&#x27;t let the manicurist soak your nails in acetone to remove it.  That will ruin your nails.  Mine puts the remover on a cotton ball and then wraps my fingers in foil.  If it is done this way, it won&#x27;t ruin your nails at all. My nails look awesome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving 5 stars to the whole Shellac system (Base Coat, Color Coat and Top Coat) as it only works when used together.  I have very soft nails and they always brake up when they reach certain length, but since I&#x27;ve been using the shellac system my nails got stronger and look more beautiful then ever.  I&#x27;m using the Negligee color as I like the natural look.  I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with the results.  This system is not only for those who like to keep the nail polish beautiful for a minimum of 2 weeks, but also for those who like to let their nails grow longer and stronger.  I&#x27;m so happy CND came up with this product! I can finally have beautiful nails as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wanted to mention how easy this system is to do it yourself. I&#x27;ve been doing them at home and I had absolutely no problem applying them.  My nails look better then EVER!</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life my nails look nice for more than a day and I didn&#x27;t have to spend a fortune.  I will say this though, I can not go 21 days, it is more like 14.</li>
            <li> Def for use in a solon with UV lighting. Does not dry well without. Its what I expected but I cant use it at home so thats a bummer.</li>
            <li> I received exactly what I ordered - which is great, considering you sometimes never know what you may end up getting. It was delivered within a few days, and was in a bubble-wrapped box. I&#x27;ve used it, and it works like it is supposed to - my nails look great!</li>
            <li> Seeing some mixed reviews on here, but I thought it was a pretty good nail polish. Don&#x27;t know what the \\&quot;UV Base coat\\&quot; does, but it works for me. I&#x27;d recommend this unless you have strong opinions otherwise.</li>
            <li> I have been using Shellac for 14 months.  My nails were soft, short and flaking off,a mess.  I started taking gelatin a month before I used Shellac, the results of the polish were amazing. I only leave it on for two weeks at a time because my nails are now so strong and grow so fast.  Gel ruins your nails because they have to be totally filed across the whole nail every time you use it.  My nails always look so good!  Absolutely no problems.  I have had them done by different manicurists when I am on vacation.  This stuff is a miracle! I am hooked, best thing on the market for nails.</li>
            <li> The manicure lasted all of 2 days before it chipped. Save your money,</li>
            <li> Great products, need to be careful not to get on the skin though.  Need to carefully follow instructions.  Got it in record time.</li>
            <li> The product is as described!Seems to be original.</li>
            <li> I bought a UV light here on Amazon and do my own CND shellac.  Expensive investment up front but salons get a premium for this service and it is no harder than just painting your nails.  With the CND Shellac system I get two weeks of perfect, chip-free wear.  Check out the wattage that shellac requires and get a light.  It does not need to be the \\&quot;official\\&quot; CND light.  CNDs site tells you how to use it.  Base Coat, cook for 10 seconds, one coat cook for 2 minutes, second coat cook for 2 minutes,top coat cook for 2 minutes.  Take off the sticky with rubbing alcohol.  You can also clean up your mistakes with rubbing alcohol BEFORE you cook it so it&#x27;s must less obnoxious than nail polish remover.  You&#x27;ll need acetone to soak it off, but 15 minutes gets it done.  GREAT stuff.  Go to the salon and try it.  If you love it, get a home set up.</li>
            <li> Only used once because the stupid uv lamp broke but the shallac worked on my kid.  Lasted over a week and with the way she plays, is great!</li>
            <li> I love using this polish and when I have completed the polishing, I know that it will last for days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all brands of gel nail polish, and Shellac&#x27;s brand is the least destructive to the nail, lasts the longest and is the easiest to remove.</li>
            <li> A little thicker than regular nail polish, but once you get used to it, its easy to use and works great!</li>
            <li> I bought this base coat along with the top coat and just use my own polish. I have stopped using the base coat because it was preventing my nails from drying/ curing fully. Regardless of how long I left the uv light on, it just never seemed to \\&quot;set\\&quot;. I do my nails every Sunday and have found the best approach is to use whatever inexpensive nail polish color you want (I paint in little designs and stripes sometime even with tempra paint.) and then the top coat. I will say that the base coat makes the whole thing a LOT easier to remove, but for me, it&#x27;s still not worth it for me. Make sure that the polish you use is completely dry before moving to the top coat or you will get wrinkles. Also, to remove the polish just pour a little remover (WITH acetone) in the cap, soak your finger for about 45 seconds and use a cottonball- not tissue or tp, etc. Cottonballs have the texture that you&#x27;ll need to help remove subborn polish. The whole process takes a while, but it has become part of my forced relaxation time! :)</li>
            <li> The item I ordered advertised stated \\&quot;CND COSMETICS SHELLAC GAL NAIL POLISH Uv BASE COAT\\&quot;.  What I received is completely different....I received POWER POLISH that must cured under Uv light.  I had the same thing happen in the past with another shipper so I  was careful when ordering this time but was still MISLEAD!!!!</li>
            <li> First thing the REAL stuff works great. But not all sellers are equal, make sure you review who you are purchasing from.  Don&#x27;t buy from Cosmetics Central.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought Shellac CND base coat back in march because my first bottle (bought from someone else) started to run low and I had a little money on hand.  So bought it for 17.74. it did not come in a box (should of been a sign) put it on a shelf and waited for my current bottle to run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well all this time later I need the new bottle but when I went to pick it up I could hear a MIXING BEAD inside!! Shellac CND does not come with mixing beads inside the bottle. Plus the liquid was far to thin to be the real stuff.  Now I&#x27;m stuck with a bottle of knockoff and bare nails till a new bottle arrives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEVER BUY FROM COSMETICS CENTRAL is my advice, and test every bottle as soon as you get it, I wish I had, Its been far to long for me to even try and get anything out of the sellers.</li>
            <li> This base coat works with the full shellac system, but be careful not to apply too thick or it will blotch and lump.  A VERY thin coat is needed.  I have gotten to where I use a regular base coat, regular color polish and the shellac top coat for easiest application and a good long wear.  My manicure still lasts two weeks.  I dry all with UV light as you would shellac, but the regular base and regular colors are easier for me to apply plus I get a wider variety of color.</li>
            <li> Gave it as a gift they love it -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --</li>
            <li> will buy more, good product, very detail and presentable. my kids love it and adorable everyone love it when they see it.</li>
            <li> and I have tried other shellac-gel-type polishes.  CND does the best, if you DO try other brands, just pay attention to the price of the bottle for the amount of product in the bottle...CND you get more for the money.</li>
            <li> I have been using Shellac for over 2 years now &amp; absolutely love this polish. Every 3 weeks I change my polish as opposed to every 3 days. What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same one you get when you go to a salon.  What is there to rate?  You either like Shellac or you don&#x27;t!!</li>
            <li> IT WAS SO  SMALL COULD USES ONLY 2X</li>
            <li> Great base coat for shellac manicures. I&#x27;ve even tied this with normal polish and used the CND shellac top coat to make my normal polish last longer before chipping.</li>
            <li> Great shape and works good.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing shellac products for home (non-professional) use for about a year now, and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. My nails are healthy, and with the shellac&#x27;s strength on my nails I have been able to grow them to lengths I have never managed before. (I have very flimsy nails, they bend/snap easily usually.) The shellac has an easy learning curve- it is just like painting your nails, and once you get the hang of the coat thickness/edge-to tip it is flawless in application and wear. It does have special removal instructions, the special curing lamp, and all steps are required to do a shellac manicure, but it is a fraction of the cost to do the manicures at home. The .25oz bottles of base and top coat last me about 7 months of doing my nails every 2 weeks, and a few friends&#x27; manicures as well.(I have been happier doing my own nails- so many times the salons do a shoddy job anyway...)</li>
