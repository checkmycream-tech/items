    <ol>
            <li>We got them just in time using prime, excellent!!</li>
            <li>When i pulled them out, i was happy with the clips &amp; etc..</li>
            <li>I am really happy with this product.</li>
            <li>The hair arrived to me in 2 days, it looked very nice when I took it out of the box.</li>
            <li>Heat resistance is fair.</li>
            <li>I love them!</li>
            <li>I really love these and recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li>Great quality of hair plus not thin!!!  </li>
            <li>Anyways, i recieved these quick &amp; was happy with that.</li>
            <li>but they get tangled very easily.</li>
            <li>It also falls out more than my own hair does.</li>
            <li>So i bought some detangle spray and it helped i think much better .</li>
            <li>and after they were softer than before and plus using the detangleing spray it was much much better</li>
            <li>These are pretty good extensions .</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for some to wear once, these are fine.</li>
            <li>These reminded me of a Halloween wig you get for cheap, just to wear for Halloween.</li>
            <li>The clips fell off the hair super easily</li>
            <li>Put the 4 clip piece in first and already fell in love.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t what expected super plastic material!!!!</li>
            <li>Although I was pretty nervous about getting synthetic hair, these hair extensions went beyond my expectations!</li>
            <li>At first when i wore them they would get pretty tangled easily and i would have to brush them out and after a while they would get tangled again .</li>
            <li>I think for the price that they are worth it.</li>
            <li>friendly&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Lol, right when i stuck it to the iron it did</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with my purchase, and if you don&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on real hair extensions or nervous about other synthetic extensions, I recommend getting these!</li>
            <li>They tangle pretty easily, which is normal, but these extensions are super soft and they&#x27;re the closest thing to real hair!</li>
            <li>The extensions are nice, soft and long.</li>
            <li>but I certainly wasn&#x27;t expecting what I recieved.</li>
            <li>because although i can&#x27;t straighten it, the hair does look somewhat real &amp; I think it deserves some credit.</li>
            <li>They match my color really well.</li>
            <li>They can&#x27;t curl &amp; they were just too much of a hassle to even keep in my hair.</li>
            <li>and so the shipping is fast.</li>
            <li>Way to much of a hassle to bother with.</li>
            <li>I purchased 2 packs as a quick solution, because my hairstylist cancelled on my sister last minute for SENIOR BALL.</li>
            <li>Super long</li>
            <li>Extensions are very soft and don&#x27;t tangle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this hair the only thing is that the top half of my hair is redish brown and the bodom half of my hair is black so its still cute if I wear half my hair up.</li>
            <li>After an hour of trying with these clip ins, I just ended up giving them to my 7 year old sister to play dress up with.</li>
            <li>but the only thing is the hair falls down easily....</li>
            <li>The only perk here is that the extensions are very soft.</li>
            <li>I really love them and have nothing negative to say!</li>
            <li>Very low heat, unable to get a good curl but waves are very possible!</li>

            <li> Very low heat, unable to get a good curl but waves are very possible!</li>
            <li> the hair is super thin and tangles immediately</li>
            <li> It felt far too heavy for my liking and it became a tangled wad of synthetic hair the moment it came out of the packaging.</li>
            <li> Though, it does tangle in the long run.</li>
            <li> Was too long</li>
            <li> They come very long</li>
            <li> The ends were so dry and brittle after 5 minutes</li>
            <li> We are EXTREMELY disappointed, thankfully the pictures came out stunning and she looked terrific!</li>
            <li> I wish you could dye this hair though also the hair gets nappy a lot but other than that I like it</li>
            <li> so I cut mine down.</li>
            <li> so I tried cutting the ends off, It was better for about 10 minutes, then reverted right back to the dreadful mess that it was before.</li>
            <li> so I had to dye my hair jet black when I ordered off black.</li>
            <li> and it was just a mess.</li>
            <li> It would tangle a little when i ran my fingers through the hair as well.</li>
            <li> Recommend to wash it once a week, if you are like me wearing it everyday.</li>
            <li> Granted this is not top of the line hair</li>
            <li> I recommend purchasing two packs if your hair is medium to thick.</li>
            <li> Bought 2 for thick hair.</li>
            <li> Clips were broken..</li>
            <li> or else they would look really fake.</li>
            <li> Tangles like crazy and doesn&#x27;t curl nor hold a curl.</li>
            <li> But I couldn&#x27;t even run my fingers through it, that&#x27;s how badly it was tangled.</li>
            <li> Very bad quality..</li>

            <li> I purchased 2 packs as a quick solution, because my hairstylist cancelled on my sister last minute for SENIOR BALL. We got them just in time using prime, excellent!! BUT, after wearing the extensions ALL night (approx: 8 hours) they turned into DREADS! Granted this is not top of the line hair BUT geeeeez we could barley even get them out of her hair without causing pain! And then they were ALL bunched together when they FINALLY came out. These reminded me of a Halloween wig you get for cheap, just to wear for Halloween. We are EXTREMELY disappointed, thankfully the pictures came out stunning and she looked terrific! Anyways, I recommend this for PLAY only. BTW- they DO NOT curl and DO NOT take heat well AT ALL!!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Heat friendly&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Lol, right when i stuck it to the iron it did this.&lt;br /&gt;Total waste.&lt;br /&gt;I give it 3 because although i can&#x27;t straighten it, the hair does look somewhat real &amp; I think it deserves some credit. I don&#x27;t like being lied to. Anyways, i recieved these quick &amp; was happy with that. When i pulled them out, i was happy with the clips &amp; etc.. i just had to cut like 6 inches off or else they would look really fake. If you&#x27;re looking for some to wear once, these are fine. I just don&#x27;t recommend wearing them a lot like i had in mind. 👌&lt;br /&gt;Ill post a picture with them in sometime soon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this hair the only thing is that the top half of my hair is redish brown and the bodom half of my hair is black so its still cute if I wear half my hair up. I wish you could dye this hair though also the hair gets nappy a lot but other than that I like it</li>
            <li> These are pretty good extensions . At first when i wore them they would get pretty tangled easily and i would have to brush them out and after a while they would get tangled again . It would tangle a little when i ran my fingers through the hair as well. So i bought some detangle spray and it helped i think much better . BUT .. after a week i decided to wash them and i did and used conditioner too and after they were softer than before and plus using the detangleing spray it was much much better (:  . I think for the price that they are worth it.</li>
            <li> I like it... but the only thing is the hair falls down easily.... 4 stars</li>
            <li> Very bad quality.. Clips were broken.. Smells like plastic even after washing.. Not recommended at all</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what expected super plastic material!!!!</li>
            <li> I love them! If you&#x27;re looking for quality synthetic hair at an affordable price, then you should look into Onedor&#x27;s products. Although I was pretty nervous about getting synthetic hair, these hair extensions went beyond my expectations! I recommend purchasing two packs if your hair is medium to thick. They tangle pretty easily, which is normal, but these extensions are super soft and they&#x27;re the closest thing to real hair! You can apply heat and style them ONLY after it dries from washing them. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase, and if you don&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on real hair extensions or nervous about other synthetic extensions, I recommend getting these!</li>
            <li> I am really happy with this product. They match my color really well. I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
            <li> Super long but they get tangled very easily. They can&#x27;t curl &amp; they were just too much of a hassle to even keep in my hair. The clips fell off the hair super easily and it was just a mess.</li>
            <li> Hair is constantly knotting up or shedding.</li>
            <li> It felt far too heavy for my liking and it became a tangled wad of synthetic hair the moment it came out of the packaging. The only perk here is that the extensions are very soft.</li>
            <li> I ordered these Friday night and today is Monday and so the shipping is fast. Put the 4 clip piece in first and already fell in love. when you open the package you can see how well the product is shipped. Extensions are very soft and don&#x27;t tangle. I really love them and have nothing negative to say! I really love these and recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li> The extensions are nice, soft and long. Though, it does tangle in the long run. Recommend to wash it once a week, if you are like me wearing it everyday.</li>
            <li> Great quality of hair plus not thin!!!  Will definitely buy again!!</li>
            <li> The hair gets so tangled just trying to put in, it looks ratty when finished. It also falls out more than my own hair does. Way to much of a hassle to bother with.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I was expecting when I ordered this hair but I certainly wasn&#x27;t expecting what I recieved. The hair arrived to me in 2 days, it looked very nice when I took it out of the box. But I couldn&#x27;t even run my fingers through it, that&#x27;s how badly it was tangled.

After an hour of trying with these clip ins, I just ended up giving them to my 7 year old sister to play dress up with.</li>
            <li> Hai just received the product today amd the hair is super thin and tangles immediately</li>
            <li> Color was off so I had to dye my hair jet black when I ordered off black. Tangles like crazy and doesn&#x27;t curl nor hold a curl. Was too long so I cut it. Won&#x27;t purchase again. Says heat resistant but the hair burned</li>
            <li> Bought 2 for thick hair. They come very long so I cut mine down. Heat resistance is fair. Very low heat, unable to get a good curl but waves are very possible! I recommend powdering them and going at them with low heat to match your hair.</li>
