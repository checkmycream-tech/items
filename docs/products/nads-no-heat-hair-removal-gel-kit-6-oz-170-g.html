            <li>I received exactly what was pictured and the product works great!</li>
            <li>I even had to warm it a bit to get it out of the jar.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>and I had to apply to one area more than once to achieve results.  </li>
            <li>Been using it for many years</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Works exactly the way a body wax should with the added bonus of being able to wipe off any leftover sticky residue with warm water!</li>
            <li>Simply the best waxing product I have ever bought.</li>
            <li>Their may be a better waxing product</li>
            <li>LOVE Nads.</li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite home waxing kit.  </li>
            <li>It hurt a million times more then sally hansen&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>If you want to see any results at all make sure to heat up just so its like an oily consistency.</li>
            <li>Love this product, been using it for years</li>
            <li>Probably would have had better results too.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>The long wood spatulas are great for hard-to-reach places!</li>
            <li>I love how easy it washes out with water too.</li>
            <li>The wax gel itself washes right off with warm water and soap.</li>
            <li>A little more sticky than the Nads of yesteryear, but it still does a great job!</li>
            <li>Works great--so easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is used easily without heating, it washes off easily and you can wash and resuse the cloth strips.</li>
            <li>I tried many different products and this is the best by far</li>
            <li>The gel glides on smooth and the hair removes completely on clean skin.</li>
            <li>If you keep it in a dry place it will keep working great.</li>
            <li>strong enough to pull the most stubborn hair but doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin at all plus you can wash the excess of with water!</li>
            <li>I think I just need something more powerful, so I&#x27;m ordering a professional wax set.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as effective as what i am used to but it does do like a solid 70% of the job if used correctly.</li>
            <li>I followed all the directions exactly, and yes it does hurt somewhat, but the results were not as good as I expected.  </li>
            <li>Overall this product was okay, but not phenominal, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li>it can become too hot for your skin.</li>
            <li>I put the gel container with the lid on in a bowl of hot water and let it sit for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>hot waxes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>did exactly as the directions said and maybe 5 hairs came off.</li>
            <li>So simple to use, the strips are washable which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very hairy</li>
            <li>this is the best cold wax on the market.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely not be switching to Nad&#x27;s but its an okay kit to fall back on.</li>
            <li>And do not use the cleansing wipes, use  a dry cloth to clean the skin before you apply it.</li>
            <li>ended up shaving like normal.</li>
            <li>I thought I would try a new product because what I normally use was out of stock.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care that it doesn&#x27;t require heating up; it won&#x27;t remove hair and you make your skin red hot.</li>
            <li>It seemed to work better on some areas of skin than others, not sure why.  </li>
            <li>product works okay on legs where skin is taut and hard naturally but AVOID at all costs in bikini area and armpits!</li>
            <li>It barely removes hair.</li>
            <li>You need to keep applying and it is very gooey - totally not worth it.</li>

            <li> After trying a few different waxing products, I wanted to try cool wax because it is supposed to hurt less than traditional</li>
            <li> It takes some practice so don&#x27;t give up on your first few tries.</li>
            <li> The gel was hard and then too hot once heated for 20 seconds.</li>
            <li> I just use it for my eyebrows, I never am patient enough to wait for my leg hair to get that long.</li>
            <li> First, in my experience the hair has to be fairly long to work, at least 1/4&amp;#34</li>
            <li> You have to keep it in a dry place, away from the bathroom, because with humidity from the shower it will obviously lose its efficiency.</li>

            <li> No too long or</li>
            <li> It used to last twice as long plus a little left over.</li>
            <li> It takes a very long time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used professional hair removal wax systems in the past and believe me when I say that no matter how careful one is, there is always a mess.</li>
            <li> Provided its used correctly...its easy and less painful than plucking one brow hair out at a time.</li>
            <li> And less pain and irritation than other wax&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many others, but they were all crap.  </li>
            <li> Messy, sticky, and doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Never again you&#x27;ll have unnoticed bits of wax that refused to come out and get sticky on your legs.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do what it said and it was messy</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is I wish the gel came in a bigger container like it used to.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past, and I remembered it working well, so I ordered it again.  </li>
            <li> They are hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> It was awful compared to what I am used to.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Nad&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t work for me, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the company&#x27;s fault. I think I just need something more powerful, so I&#x27;m ordering a professional wax set. Try Nad&#x27;s and see if it&#x27;ll work for you, but don&#x27;t buy an entire jar. Look for the Nad&#x27;s wax strips or facial wand instead so you can give it a try without having to toss out an entire jar if it doesn&#x27;t work out.</li>
            <li> This product arrived in a condition that was unusable. I had to microwave it to get it to a consistency to use.  Once I got it where it could be spread, it worked okay but nothing like they advertised.  It takes a very long time and I had to apply to one area more than once to achieve results.  They do not include enough cotton strips to do both legs.  I don&#x27;t believe I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Nad&#x27;s is the best wax ever!! After you use it the hair grows back thinner and thinner until it doesn&#x27;t anymore if you keep waxing when the hair grows back. And less pain and irritation than other wax&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used in the passed. Can be used anywhere hair grows. I will only use Nad&#x27;s brand wax otherwise I just shave.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great.  No heat!  Been using it for many years and I love it.</li>
            <li> It barely removes hair. You need to keep applying and it is very gooey - totally not worth it. I don&#x27;t care that it doesn&#x27;t require heating up; it won&#x27;t remove hair and you make your skin red hot.</li>
            <li> Works best with fine hair....arm hair for example. Facial, leg or underarm...not any good..messy,sticky ...I even had to warm it a bit to get it out of the jar.</li>
            <li> Works exactly the way a body wax should with the added bonus of being able to wipe off any leftover sticky residue with warm water! Good quality. Would definitely recommend.!</li>
            <li> Product does not remove hair as described. Actually didn&#x27;t remove any hair at all just pulled it</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!!</li>
            <li> It removes &#x27;peach fuzz&#x27; but doesn&#x27;t remove coarse hair. Which is why I bought it. I want to remove the dark, noticeable hair, not the barely seen hair. It states that it can be used on the legs, which I have not tried yet, but I&#x27;m wondering if it will work bc my leg hair is coarse.</li>
            <li> Amazing!! Simply the best waxing product I have ever bought. So simple to use, the strips are washable which is a huge plus. The wax gel itself washes right off with warm water and soap. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Works great--so easy.</li>
            <li> IT does the trick, hurts like an SOB but got the job done.  Their may be a better waxing product but I have yet to find it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past, and I remembered it working well, so I ordered it again.  I followed all the directions exactly, and yes it does hurt somewhat, but the results were not as good as I expected.  First, in my experience the hair has to be fairly long to work, at least 1/4&amp;#34; long, not stubbly or it does nothing.  After applying the gel, rubbing on the cloth, pulling skin taut, and yanking cloth, there was a lot of hair on the cloth.  Unfortunately, the majority of it did not include the root, which you need to get a smooth feel.  It left a stubbly layer, which at the time I couldn&#x27;t tell if it was stubble or skin irritation, but after the irritation subsided, yes, it was stubble.  It seemed to work better on some areas of skin than others, not sure why.  Overall this product was okay, but not phenominal, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was happy with the quality of the product. I received exactly what was pictured and the product works great!</li>
            <li> I just use it for my eyebrows, I never am patient enough to wait for my leg hair to get that long. Provided its used correctly...its easy and less painful than plucking one brow hair out at a time.</li>
            <li> Worked as great as always.</li>
            <li> The product arrived and I used it immediately.  It was wonderful.  I did find that heating in the microwave for 20-30 seconds helped with the consistency so it applied easier.  No too long or it can become too hot for your skin.</li>
            <li> Messy, sticky, and doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> LOVE Nads. I have been using Nads for years and it is the easiest and best hair removal system evah! I&#x27;ve used professional hair removal wax systems in the past and believe me when I say that no matter how careful one is, there is always a mess. But not with Nads.</li>
            <li> Love this product!! I buy the smaller jar now as it stays fresher until I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try a new product because what I normally use was out of stock. The gel was hard and then too hot once heated for 20 seconds. There are not enough strips and it gave me razor burn. I would not buy this again!</li>
            <li> This is the best wax ever!! I will not buy anything else after discovering this, it takes off all hair and the fact that you can reuse the strips is amazing!! I love how easy it washes out with water too.</li>
            <li> The best thing about this product is that it washes off with water! Never again you&#x27;ll have unnoticed bits of wax that refused to come out and get sticky on your legs. You have to keep it in a dry place, away from the bathroom, because with humidity from the shower it will obviously lose its efficiency. If you keep it in a dry place it will keep working great. The strips are also washable and reusable. This is a great product. It&#x27;s overpriced on Amazon though.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite home waxing kit.  They are hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time. It&#x27;s the best hair removal product out there.</li>
            <li> I always buy sally Hansen hair removal kit but this time i had to buy nad&#x27;s. It was awful compared to what I am used to. It hurt a million times more then sally hansen&#x27;s. If you want to see any results at all make sure to heat up just so its like an oily consistency. And do not use the cleansing wipes, use  a dry cloth to clean the skin before you apply it. It&#x27;s not as effective as what i am used to but it does do like a solid 70% of the job if used correctly. Will definitely not be switching to Nad&#x27;s but its an okay kit to fall back on.</li>
            <li> best hair removal there is, and affordable</li>
            <li> Easy to use. I put the gel container with the lid on in a bowl of hot water and let it sit for 5 minutes. It works great. The gel glides on smooth and the hair removes completely on clean skin. The strips can be washed and reused. I have bought several of these and now have enough strips to do both my legs. The only bad thing is I wish the gel came in a bigger container like it used to. Now one container lasts for doing both legs only once. It used to last twice as long plus a little left over.</li>
            <li> A little more sticky than the Nads of yesteryear, but it still does a great job!</li>
            <li> Love this product, been using it for years</li>
            <li> After trying a few different waxing products, I wanted to try cool wax because it is supposed to hurt less than traditional hot waxes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works okay on legs where skin is taut and hard naturally but AVOID at all costs in bikini area and armpits! Even following instructions and advice online and from aesthetician, the product removes hair somewhat well BUT NOT FROM THE ROOT aka the area looks very groomed (after a much more painful experience than anticipated and with aspirin and whiskey on board) but leaves stubble behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: if I wanted these results, I would have just shaved and saved myself a lot of pain. Probably would have had better results too.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for close to 20 years now and I love it. It takes some practice so don&#x27;t give up on your first few tries.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very hairy so take my word for it:  this is the best cold wax on the market.  I&#x27;ve used many others, but they were all crap.  This is used easily without heating, it washes off easily and you can wash and resuse the cloth strips. The long wood spatulas are great for hard-to-reach places!</li>
            <li> this wax is simply amazing! strong enough to pull the most stubborn hair but doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin at all plus you can wash the excess of with water! I tried many different products and this is the best by far</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years now and it works great every time.  Great product.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do what it said and it was messy</li>
            <li> these were terrible did exactly as the directions said and maybe 5 hairs came off. ended up shaving like normal.</li>
