            <li> Like others have said, very tight. I&#x27;m just using these until my Tsu Rag shows up.</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> Received the item in a few days product was as expected, very good quality. Overall I would recommend to anyone trying to get waves or maintain them</li>
            <li> Not a bad wave cap. Tie it up on top to make it fit right. Another pro tip: wear it OVER your doo rag to limit the amount of \\&quot;line\\&quot; on your forehead.</li>
