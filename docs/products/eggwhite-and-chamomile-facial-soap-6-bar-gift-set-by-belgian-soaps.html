    <ol>
            <li>Excellent face soap!  </li>
            <li>My brother has Belgian in-laws and they all use it (and have beautiful skin!)</li>
            <li>Awesome</li>
            <li>Please don&#x27;t wrap these beautiful soap boxes with packaging tape!</li>
            <li>The soaps are wonderful.</li>
            <li>It smelled wonderful and was made with egg whites that tighten and brighten the skin, so I bought it.</li>
            <li>and I simply loved it!</li>
            <li>This is a great deal and the box is beautiful and sturdy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great addition to my beauty cabinet.</li>
            <li>At the end of the fifth day even my boyfriend - who is oblivious to EVERYTHING - said my skin looked great</li>
            <li>so I always use a good moisturizer after I wash my face.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>My skin did have a nice feel and glow after a couple of days.</li>
            <li>Even when you think you&#x27;ve rinsed the soap all off make sure to rinse again for good measure</li>
            <li>I liked the way it softens skin.</li>
            <li>Really liked it.</li>
            <li>She liked it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is mild, and has a wonderful, clean scent.</li>
            <li>This soap smells nice and leaves you feeling clean and refreshed!</li>
            <li>They seem to restore a healthy glow.</li>

            <li>I Love this soap.  </li>
            <li>Noyt enough words to say how happy I am with this!!</li>

            <li>Love this non drying moisturizing  toning  bar</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the soap</li>
            <li>I do not let it sit for more than a minute because it can cause some irritation.</li>
            <li>These soaps smell amazing and make my skin squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>My husband told me how beautiful my skin looks and how soft it feels.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick and the seller threw in some nice samples.</li>
            <li>The soft, fresh scent is wonderful.</li>
            <li>Nothing like a great old fashioned soap that has been around for decades!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very good to find a beauty product that actually does what it claims to do.</li>
            <li>Just the best, comes in very tiny sizes but worth the price.</li>
            <li>This set is a fantastic value, and the box is super cute to boot.</li>
            <li>This soap is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>My skin felt clean and my makeup was easily removed.  </li>
            <li>It has a lovely light smell and is just the right size for handling.</li>
            <li>It was very gentle, and very lightly scented.  </li>
            <li>Excellent soap particularly for facial use.</li>
            <li>Very mild and pleasantly scented, it lathers extremely well and does not burn the skin at all like some strong soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried it and noticed that my skin felt refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li>All day my face feels clean and not sticky, or oily.</li>
            <li>You feel special and look special as well.</li>
            <li>My skin feels nice &amp; soft.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and also love the fact that it&#x27;s more reasonable than a lot of facial cleansers.</li>
            <li>My face feels clean and fresh after using it.</li>
            <li>My skin feels fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>After so many great soaps now in plastic bottles with pumps, this hand-held product still has me coming back.</li>
            <li>It truly does clean your pores and amazingly they do look smaller.</li>
            <li>This worked great year round.</li>
            <li>After letting it sit for a minute and then rinsing it off, my skin feels very clean and soft.</li>
            <li>It has a most delicate scent, and makes one feel as if one has been through a most delicious facial---at least this is what Mumzy states.</li>
            <li>ordered the box with six soaps, and the size and shape is perfect for just rubbing the bar on my wet nose and chin, avoiding the other areas of my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made a huge improvement in my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I was intrigued by the ingredients, and found the short list appealing.</li>
            <li>Overall, I love the soap.</li>
            <li>I first tried this as a gift</li>
            <li>/&gt;The small is so sweet!!!  </li>
            <li>I have used it for years and would recommend it very highly</li>
            <li>High recommended!</li>
            <li>It is has a gentle creamy foam, cleans well and is non-irritating.</li>
            <li>I received my order much faster than the time I was told it would take to receive it.</li>
            <li>The egg white soaps are a fabulous product.</li>
            <li>The soap is very soft and the texture on your face is very calming!</li>
            <li>After that, you get a glowing, oil-free, squeaky clean face staring back at you.</li>
            <li>This product feels like an old-fashioned European soap grandma might love, but believe me, it works on younger skin just as well.</li>
            <li>I have tried to use something else to wash my face and always come back to my Belgian Egg White soap:)</li>
            <li>My granddaughter, age 16, had acne and nothing worked, even the highly celebrity advertised products.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to pay high mailing costs that drive the price up.</li>
            <li>However, I have sensitive skin and find this soap to be very drying.</li>
            <li>A set of six definitely lasts you, so I think about $18 for a set of 6 is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>It really removes a ton of oil from my skin, which leaves my skin really clean but also a bit dry; that was easily fixed by applying a moisturizer afterwards (nothing new, I always apply a moisturizer).</li>
            <li>(and he had no idea I was trying something new).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 33 year old women of Danish decent</li>
            <li>When Mumzy purchased this product, I was quite surprised that the contents of the box were soap.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive combination skin</li>
            <li>but the regular pore-reducing soaps, lotions &amp; potions haven&#x27;t really worked for me.  </li>
            <li>I actually started using a bar for my whole body and like the results.  </li>
            <li>whole box is going back to Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I let is stay on face while I complete my shower.</li>
            <li>These little soaps are fabulous and they actually tighten pores.</li>
            <li>The weather is starting to dip below 30 degrees where I live</li>
            <li>In my review for the sunflower I stated that you really have to be careful cause it will sting your eyes</li>
            <li>It lathers very well; the soap is really concentrated so that barely any is needed to produce a thick lather.</li>
            <li>I am 50 years old and have suddenly developed oily skin and breakouts due to endocrine problems.  </li>
            <li>My only tip is to not leave it on too long if you have sensitive skin.</li>

            <li> This tiny egg-shaped bar lasts months, if you keep it dry between uses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey but hard to find and worth every penny!</li>
            <li> (yes, I know it&#x27;s soap), but I didn&#x27;t have near as much trouble with this soap.  </li>
            <li> To some of the other posters out there who noted that there is a residue left on their skin: you HAVE to thoroughly rinse your skin!  </li>
            <li> My face doesn&#x27;t feel dry either.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m just down to my last bar.</li>
            <li> I ran across this soap at a quirky little store in Richmond.</li>
            <li> the soap is little bit bigger than your palm</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried all the usual bar soaps (Ivory and Dove) and the pump-style liquid facial soaps, but this one finally made my angry complexion calm down.</li>
            <li> My skin is dry during the winter and a little oily i the summer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the same box for the past year and a half</li>
            <li> The pores on my face (especially in my T-zone) have been slowly gaining in size for awhile now</li>
            <li> We bought small individual ones in a novelty shop along the Oregon coast and were not able to find them.</li>
            <li> only negative would be that I did not realize the bars of soap are on the small side.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get that harsh drying like some face cleaners.</li>
            <li> few tips -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for the past few years and have seen a decrease in break-outs.</li>
            <li> but I just bought a small container of another cleanser and use that when I&#x27;m on the road.</li>
            <li> That is an issue to me every time I have bought face cleaning products in the past.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment in a product that has camomile oil in it and is supposed to &amp;#34;soothe and make the skin soft to the touch.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Too bad it is only for humans,---and not for pussycats!</li>
            <li> I figured it would take at least a month to see a difference - I was WRONG.  </li>
            <li> It makes them useless as gifts when that is done.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> I have tried all kinds of very expensive cleansers and nothing compares to this.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> These little soaps are fabulous and they actually tighten pores. Six to a box, so  I shared some with my niece, she likes them too. They seem to restore a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> This soap is fabulous.  I hope I am always able to find it.  I am 50 years old and have suddenly developed oily skin and breakouts due to endocrine problems.  This seems to do the trick.  I have tried all kinds of very expensive cleansers and nothing compares to this.</li>
            <li> This tiny egg-shaped bar lasts months, if you keep it dry between uses. It&#x27;s made a huge improvement in my sensitive skin. I&#x27;d tried all the usual bar soaps (Ivory and Dove) and the pump-style liquid facial soaps, but this one finally made my angry complexion calm down. This product feels like an old-fashioned European soap grandma might love, but believe me, it works on younger skin just as well.</li>
            <li> Excellent soap particularly for facial use. Very mild and pleasantly scented, it lathers extremely well and does not burn the skin at all like some strong soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only negative would be that I did not realize the bars of soap are on the small side.  I should have investigated further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, this is a terrific facial and body soap with lots of lather!</li>
            <li> My granddaughter, age 16, had acne and nothing worked, even the highly celebrity advertised products.  This worked for her and its all she will use now.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter. We bought small individual ones in a novelty shop along the Oregon coast and were not able to find them. This is a great deal and the box is beautiful and sturdy. My daughter loves using this on her face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for the past few years and have seen a decrease in break-outs. I love the smell and also love the fact that it&#x27;s more reasonable than a lot of facial cleansers. I&#x27;ve had the same box for the past year and a half and I&#x27;m just down to my last bar. The only issue is that it&#x27;s not convenient to travel with...but I just bought a small container of another cleanser and use that when I&#x27;m on the road.</li>
            <li> Excellent face soap!  You feel special and look special as well. I would suggest this for anyone and as a gift.</li>
            <li> When Mumzy purchased this product, I was quite surprised that the contents of the box were soap. Yet,---what a soap indeed! This is a smashing product! It has a most delicate scent, and makes one feel as if one has been through a most delicious facial---at least this is what Mumzy states. Too bad it is only for humans,---and not for pussycats!</li>
            <li> I think the trick with this soap is to lather your face up (like a mask) and leave it on for 5-10 minutes. After that, you get a glowing, oil-free, squeaky clean face staring back at you. Over time, egg white tightens pores and makes the skin look flawless. It&#x27;s a great addition to my beauty cabinet.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive combination skin and I adore this soap. My brother has Belgian in-laws and they all use it (and have beautiful skin!) The soft, fresh scent is wonderful. One bar goes on and on when stored in a well-draining soap dish, and it never cracks or dries out or crumbles. I bought these ages ago, use the soap every day, and I&#x27;m still only on my second bar. This set is a fantastic value, and the box is super cute to boot. Shipping was quick and the seller threw in some nice samples. High recommended!</li>
            <li> I saw these in a local store for $75.00.  I was intrigued by the ingredients, and found the short list appealing. I also like that once the soap is gone, there is no plastic remaining and I can recycle the cardboard. That is an issue to me every time I have bought face cleaning products in the past. I also like that this soap does not have any chemical additives, and I like how my skin feels after I use it.  As long as I can get these soaps, especially at amazon&#x27;s price, I will not be going back to any of the more expensive products I used to buy.</li>
            <li> I have used this soap for my face for about 3 years now and I won&#x27;t use anything else. I have tried to use something else to wash my face and always come back to my Belgian Egg White soap:)</li>
            <li> I Love this soap.  It will be my forever soap.  After trying this I will never use regular soap again.&lt;br /&gt;The small is so sweet!!!  Noyt enough words to say how happy I am with this!!</li>
            <li> I decided to try this soap after having a cousin of mine tell me about it. I shopped around and couldn&#x27;t find a shop that carried it or it was more expensive than Amazon. I tried it and noticed that my skin felt refreshed and clean. I didn&#x27;t get that harsh drying like some face cleaners. My skin did have a nice feel and glow after a couple of days. This soap actually worked for shaving too without the skin rash!</li>
            <li> The pores on my face (especially in my T-zone) have been slowly gaining in size for awhile now but the regular pore-reducing soaps, lotions &amp; potions haven&#x27;t really worked for me.  After seeing these egg white soaps mentioned in a magazine article I thought I&#x27;d give them a try.  I&#x27;m a 33 year old women of Danish decent so I hoped maybe something that works for the Sweeds would work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a skeptic I figured it would take at least a month to see a difference - I was WRONG.  After the second day of using the soap my pores were noticeably smaller.  At the end of the fifth day even my boyfriend - who is oblivious to EVERYTHING - said my skin looked great (and he had no idea I was trying something new).  I&#x27;m not at the end of my third week and I have to say that this product has taken 5 years off of my face.  Plus, since the texture and pores of my skin improved, my makeup even goes on better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few tips - since the soap is based on egg whites it tends to be somewhat drying so I always use a good moisturizer after I wash my face.  The weather is starting to dip below 30 degrees where I live and I haven&#x27;t noticed any over-drying or flaking of my skin so I think I&#x27;ll be able to continue to use it through the winter.  To some of the other posters out there who noted that there is a residue left on their skin: you HAVE to thoroughly rinse your skin!  Even when you think you&#x27;ve rinsed the soap all off make sure to rinse again for good measure and you&#x27;ll be all set.</li>
            <li> After so many great soaps now in plastic bottles with pumps, this hand-held product still has me coming back. It is has a gentle creamy foam, cleans well and is non-irritating. It has a lovely light smell and is just the right size for handling. I am now stocking up. Fortunately, a local museum store stocks them and I don&#x27;t have to pay high mailing costs that drive the price up.</li>
            <li> I bought this set and a set of the sunflower as well.  In my review for the sunflower I stated that you really have to be careful cause it will sting your eyes (yes, I know it&#x27;s soap), but I didn&#x27;t have near as much trouble with this soap.  It was very gentle, and very lightly scented.  My skin felt clean and my makeup was easily removed.  I actually started using a bar for my whole body and like the results.  A set of six definitely lasts you, so I think about $18 for a set of 6 is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> My skin is so smooth!  Love this non drying moisturizing  toning  bar</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. My face is glowing. My husband told me how beautiful my skin looks and how soft it feels. I will never go back to my exspensive face wash ever. Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for about two weeks. It truly does clean your pores and amazingly they do look smaller. However, I have sensitive skin and find this soap to be very drying. However, I have worked a go-around. I only put the soap on my nose and chin, as they are my trouble spots, and apply a gentle cleaning gel to the rest of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the box with six soaps, and the size and shape is perfect for just rubbing the bar on my wet nose and chin, avoiding the other areas of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very good to find a beauty product that actually does what it claims to do. This facial soap is now part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li> I liked the way it softens skin. Do recommend it. My face felt smoother and brighter. Really liked it. Awesome</li>
            <li> I have used this facial soap for years.&lt;br /&gt;I love it.&lt;br /&gt;It is mild, and has a wonderful, clean scent.</li>
            <li> I love the soap but it was actually intended as a bridal shower gift. Please don&#x27;t wrap these beautiful soap boxes with packaging tape! It makes them useless as gifts when that is done.&lt;br /&gt;They still make rubber bands! thank you!</li>
            <li> I received my order much faster than the time I was told it would take to receive it. The soaps are wonderful. All day my face feels clean and not sticky, or oily. My face doesn&#x27;t feel dry either. The egg white soaps are a fabulous product.</li>
            <li> These soaps smell amazing and make my skin squeaky clean. They also last a while too!!!</li>
            <li> I ran across this soap at a quirky little store in Richmond. It smelled wonderful and was made with egg whites that tighten and brighten the skin, so I bought it. It lathers very well; the soap is really concentrated so that barely any is needed to produce a thick lather. After letting it sit for a minute and then rinsing it off, my skin feels very clean and soft. It really removes a ton of oil from my skin, which leaves my skin really clean but also a bit dry; that was easily fixed by applying a moisturizer afterwards (nothing new, I always apply a moisturizer). Overall, I love the soap.</li>
            <li> There was notihing I didn&#x27;t like about this.  I have used it for years and would recommend it very highly</li>
            <li> After reading a beauty article in a leading beauty magazine I decided to give this a try. My skin is dry during the winter and a little oily i the summer. This worked great year round. My face feels clean and fresh after using it. My only tip is to not leave it on too long if you have sensitive skin. I do not let it sit for more than a minute because it can cause some irritation.</li>
            <li> I first tried this as a gift and I simply loved it! This soap smells nice and leaves you feeling clean and refreshed! I couldn&#x27;t wait to get the boxed set! It&#x27;s a little pricey but hard to find and worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This box of 6 soaps was delivered today, so I tried it tonight.  I kept the lathered soap on my face for 5 minutes, as instructed.  Ten minutes after getting out of the shower and drying off, my facial skin was so dry that it hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole box is going back to Amazon.  What a disappointment in a product that has camomile oil in it and is supposed to &amp;#34;soothe and make the skin soft to the touch.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I like it a lot. My skin feels nice &amp; soft. One thing to remember is to wash your face with cool.cold water to get the results at the final rinsing.</li>
            <li> I adore this soap and will now only use this soap. My daughter also tried a bar and orders it now too. She says it is the only soap that helps her breakouts. I let is stay on face while I complete my shower. My skin feels fresh and clean. Nothing like a great old fashioned soap that has been around for decades! A++++</li>
            <li> Just the best, comes in very tiny sizes but worth the price. It is all I use.</li>
            <li> the soap is little bit bigger than your palm but as there are 6 of them in one box, you don&#x27;t have to worry about using them all! The soap is very soft and the texture on your face is very calming! I recommended this to my mom and friends!!</li>
            <li> This was for my wife.  She liked it.</li>
