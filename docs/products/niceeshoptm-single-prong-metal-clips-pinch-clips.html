            <li>great price, fast delivery</li>
            <li>WE KNOW GOING TO MAKE WHAT WE LOVE BOWS.  </li>
            <li>Love it took a while to get</li>
            <li>But I should have read the description more closely.</li>
            <li>Glad to have found these clips.  </li>
            <li>love the price for them</li>
            <li>so I checked each clip to make sure they worked.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure I can find another use for them,  maybe tie clips</li>
            <li>These came in perfect for my flower projects I am currently working on.</li>
            <li>And for cheap!</li>
            <li>:):)</li>
            <li>I love the clips.</li>
            <li>Many pieces fell apart when I used them.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to start crafting! :)</li>
            <li>My customers who have these clips love how easily they go into their hair and don&#x27;t budge.</li>
            <li>so overall this was very good</li>
            <li>Also straight out of the package I had to weed through the clips before I&#x27;d find a good one to use.</li>
            <li>super awesome came like 1.5 weeks earlier.</li>
            <li>The metal bends easily and therefore breaks where it bends.</li>
            <li>Easily bent.</li>
            <li>These clips are flimsy, they crack easily &amp; break if handled after it cracks.</li>
            <li>I liked these so much, I ordered some more.</li>
            <li>Great product all Iteams accounted for and great quality and came fast than the earliest expected to arrive it came 3 or 4 days before the earliest expected date amazing !!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>This are great, I spent many many hours looking for clips that would work for making hair clips.  </li>
            <li>What can I say, they are clips and they work just fine.</li>
            <li>come with a hundred accurate sized clips.</li>
            <li>But overall a great price for what you get.</li>
            <li>Cheap price, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Product is cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Overall a great deal.</li>
            <li>Cheap clips but works for what I needed them for in my hobby craft.  </li>
            <li>Very happy with these for the price, but when i counted them, i only got 98 in the bag and 1 clip of a different kind.</li>
            <li>very worth</li>
            <li>Worth it for me!</li>
            <li>I love purchasing items I can use for various creative projects in bulk!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so excited they arrived weeks before they were suppose to.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed in product just the time it took to get it.</li>
            <li>super cheaply made.</li>
            <li>These are super cheap, and did not work for what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Super cheap and flimsy.</li>
            <li>Just generic hair clips and a good price.</li>
            <li>These are great for bow making and other things.</li>
            <li>And they open easily and close safely.</li>
            <li>I slide the smooth jaw through the yarn and connect two or more pieces!</li>
            <li>The only positive thing is that there are many of them in the bag. :)</li>
            <li>Huge rip off, and absolute rubbish.</li>
            <li>I make...took awhile to get them but worth it</li>
            <li>but it was worth the wait..</li>
            <li>not even worth the money</li>
            <li>well worth the wait</li>
            <li>the money took a lil longer to get but worth it</li>
            <li>Price is right.  </li>
            <li>Whatever machine they use to stamp out the parts does not produce a safe edge on either the top or bottom half.</li>
            <li>Bent far to easily.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>there are many of these clips out there for about the same price where the shipping time has been up to two months.</li>
            <li>Product is pretty self explanatory.</li>
            <li>Many of the clips broke, especially when I tried to remove them.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>Some of them give crack across after first use...</li>
            <li>From what I can tell, these hold up pretty well.</li>
            <li>I love these clips because they&#x27;re not too big</li>
            <li>they were loose in a box ,  and when i tried to attach a hairbow on them , they bend/break very easy ..</li>
            <li>My only problem with them is that they break really easy.</li>
            <li>Great price but not worth it, since I&#x27;ve  had to replace or repair several clips that I sold.</li>
            <li>Definitely not for fine hair.</li>
            <li>Would be worth paying a little bit more and getting some stronger metal clips.</li>
            <li>i receive it ahead of time, very inexpensive</li>
            <li>I also find that the strength of these is a lot better than I would have expected.</li>
            <li>also appreciate the fast shipping time-</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks.  </li>
            <li>For the price you really can&#x27;t beat this.</li>
            <li>and I needed alligator clips that would really stay put.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t see a whole lot of difference in quality between these and the ones I brought at Walmart either.  </li>
            <li>and it makes blow drying and styling my hair so much easier then it would with me trying to use scrunchies which are a hassle and rip my hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>The clips are a little small if u just look at them but there perfect in ur hair</li>
            <li>Exceptional quality for the price, but Very small.</li>
            <li>I found one decent one out of every five that I used.</li>
            <li>I like these clips because I got a lot for a decent price.</li>
            <li>These clips were a little bit smaller than I was hoping for, but overall they will work great for what I need them for.</li>
            <li>They clamp pretty tight, so there is no slipping on the hair, even on my young child with very fine</li>
            <li>These are one of my top choices for hair pins that stay firmly in place.</li>
            <li>For the price these are reasonably good hair clips but the internal edges are razor sharp and will cut your hair or your fingers if you don&#x27;t dull them by filing smooth with a file or maybe sanding with some sand paper.</li>
            <li>Many of them had teeth that did not line up correctly when opened and closed, and a couple broke when I tried to open them.</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>They stay in my 2 year old&#x27;s hair so well that I have converted all of her bows to these clips.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>I found during a hair-curling session that these were much too teensy and fragile to prove their purchase value.</li>
            <li>I ordered the clips they came early.</li>
            <li>Also, I wasn&#x27;t expecting them for another week and came early.</li>
            <li>I use these for hair clips I make and they not only make the piece functional, but in a very durable manner.</li>
            <li>The clip bends easily, and I didn&#x27;t think that we were hard on them.</li>
            <li>Smaller than I expected but useful.</li>
            <li>Overall i am pretty happy, but the fact that the order wasn&#x27;t 100 of the alligator clips is kinda annoying.</li>
            <li>i only used them for my daughters thus far .</li>
            <li>I have continously opened and closed these to see how much abuse they could take and each time they hold up.</li>
            <li>I attach my bows by wrapping yarn around the middle and a dab of glue and they have held up very well!</li>
            <li>So even if some of the 100 were broken, it&#x27;s still a great bargain; I&#x27;ve only had one broken one thus far.  </li>

            <li> they were loose in a box ,  and when i tried to attach a hairbow on them , they bend/break very easy ..</li>
            <li> My only problem with them is that they break really easy.</li>
            <li> Great price but not worth it, since I&#x27;ve  had to replace or repair several clips that I sold.</li>
            <li> Definitely not for fine hair.</li>
            <li> Would be worth paying a little bit more and getting some stronger metal clips.</li>
            <li> i receive it ahead of time, very inexpensive</li>
            <li> I also find that the strength of these is a lot better than I would have expected.</li>
            <li> also appreciate the fast shipping time-</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Thanks.  </li>
            <li> For the price you really can&#x27;t beat this.</li>
            <li> and I needed alligator clips that would really stay put.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t see a whole lot of difference in quality between these and the ones I brought at Walmart either.  </li>
            <li> and it makes blow drying and styling my hair so much easier then it would with me trying to use scrunchies which are a hassle and rip my hair.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> The clips are a little small if u just look at them but there perfect in ur hair</li>
            <li> Exceptional quality for the price, but Very small.</li>
            <li> I found one decent one out of every five that I used.</li>
            <li> I like these clips because I got a lot for a decent price.</li>
            <li> These clips were a little bit smaller than I was hoping for, but overall they will work great for what I need them for.</li>
            <li> They clamp pretty tight, so there is no slipping on the hair, even on my young child with very fine</li>
            <li> These are one of my top choices for hair pins that stay firmly in place.</li>
            <li> For the price these are reasonably good hair clips but the internal edges are razor sharp and will cut your hair or your fingers if you don&#x27;t dull them by filing smooth with a file or maybe sanding with some sand paper.</li>
            <li> Many of them had teeth that did not line up correctly when opened and closed, and a couple broke when I tried to open them.</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> They stay in my 2 year old&#x27;s hair so well that I have converted all of her bows to these clips.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> I found during a hair-curling session that these were much too teensy and fragile to prove their purchase value.</li>
            <li> I ordered the clips they came early.</li>
            <li> Also, I wasn&#x27;t expecting them for another week and came early.</li>
            <li> I use these for hair clips I make and they not only make the piece functional, but in a very durable manner.</li>
            <li> The clip bends easily, and I didn&#x27;t think that we were hard on them.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected but useful.</li>
            <li> Overall i am pretty happy, but the fact that the order wasn&#x27;t 100 of the alligator clips is kinda annoying.</li>
            <li> i only used them for my daughters thus far .</li>
            <li> I have continously opened and closed these to see how much abuse they could take and each time they hold up.</li>
            <li> I attach my bows by wrapping yarn around the middle and a dab of glue and they have held up very well!</li>
            <li> So even if some of the 100 were broken, it&#x27;s still a great bargain; I&#x27;ve only had one broken one thus far.  </li>
            <li> No more sticking myself with the straight pins.</li>
            <li> If I knew that it was international and took this long, I would never placed my order with this seller.</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick hair</li>
            <li> My only complain is that between the first and second time I ordered them they decreased in size a bit.</li>
            <li> The clips were stiff to open and close at first but softened up after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> When I took it out, the content seemed smaller than I expected, so I started counting.</li>
            <li> It took a little while for me to receive them because they came from China but overall I probably waited about 2 weeks for them to come.</li>
            <li> Arrived two weeks earlier than expected!!!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re trying to figure out something to do with them but honestly not worth the money nor the ridiculously long time it took to get them.  </li>
            <li> I have not heard back from niceEshop or received the missing piece that I paid for.</li>
            <li> Not what expected.</li>
            <li> A few pieces arrived bent, but honestly a few broken pieces is worth the low price.</li>
            <li> At least 30 of the clips were set crooked and therefore unusable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still cheaper to buy in bulk than it would have been to buy the little packs at other craft stores or Walmart but just beware that the quantity and quality is not at 100%.</li>
            <li> There were several broken pieces such as springs and small pieces of metal in the bag</li>
            <li> so I feel a little cheated there, and some of the clips were already falling apart.  </li>
            <li> It works well for the project that I am doing which is making little hair bows and accessories for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Poor quality, 20% of them breaks almost instantly out of the box.</li>
            <li> were there with only 3 broken.</li>
            <li> Not sure I would use them in hair.</li>
            <li> It arrived in a small box.</li>
            <li> But just when I didn&#x27;t expect it, the package was at my door one day in less than 2 weeks!!</li>
            <li> These clips are not very sturdy, if you push to hard they break and are useless.</li>
            <li> There were a couple of broken pieces and a few that broke while handling them.</li>
            <li> : slow shipping (at least in my case) but</li>
            <li> Unpleasant to work with, low quality, and caused me pain.</li>
            <li> They are not good quality and do not hold up.</li>
            <li> but it was frustrating not to receive all 100 clips.</li>
            <li> Thin metal.</li>
            <li> Thin aluminum....</li>
            <li> Veryyyyyy poor quality</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on here before I purchased the product, and I knew that some of the clips could arrive broken.  </li>
            <li> none have broken</li>
            <li> I use them for my small online business:[...]</li>
            <li> The bottom half is the worst of the two.  </li>
            <li> I make bows for baby girls and the price was crazy at Walmart.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed with the size.  </li>
            <li> I would not purchase these again :(</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed when I received the order confirmation that the delivery was about 2 months away!!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> These clips are okay. My only problem with them is that they break really easy. The metal bends easily and therefore breaks where it bends. Would be worth paying a little bit more and getting some stronger metal clips.</li>
            <li> So there have been no issues with this order or the product.</li>
            <li> they were loose in a box ,  and when i tried to attach a hairbow on them , they bend/break very easy .. luckly for me i only used them for my daughters thus far . wont be buying them again.</li>
            <li> Used these for duct tape bow ties.  They worked great.  They latch on to hair as well as clothing.  The perfect thing for what I bought them for.</li>
            <li> I only received 82 1/2 clips. All 82 worked well but it was frustrating not to receive all 100 clips.</li>
            <li> I used the clips to re-twist my locks, they were very flimsy, wasn&#x27;t very impressed, $3 for a 100 clips, guess I got what I paid for</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Arrived two weeks earlier than expected!!!</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected but useful.</li>
            <li> Not as sturdy as I would have liked.  Sometimes when you try to use as a hair clip, it becomes misaligned.</li>
            <li> great price, fast delivery</li>
            <li> i receive it ahead of time, very inexpensive i receive 100 pcs compare to going to the store and pay $6 for only 20 pcs.... so i cant beat this.</li>
            <li> The product was as pictured with a great price &amp; quality! Packaged well and arrived within the dates provided. Very satisfied!!</li>
            <li> Very happy with the clips. Holds my 4-year-old hair well and she can clip them on herself without any problems.</li>
            <li> Best price for the product. I went to walmart and bought 6 pieces for almost $3 so overall this was very good</li>
            <li> These clips work great, and are helping me start up my etsy shop. My only complain is that between the first and second time I ordered them they decreased in size a bit.</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly for my sewing bows.</li>
            <li> I really like the clips they work perfectly with my hair bows I make...took awhile to get them but worth it</li>
            <li> Pinch it open once, and it breaks. Terrible.</li>
            <li> I use these to join crocheted motifs together as I plan fabric and to join the motifs to fabric pattern pieces as I design garments. These work faster and more safely than pins! And they open easily and close safely. I slide the smooth jaw through the yarn and connect two or more pieces! They took forever to arrive, but wow! such a time saver.</li>
            <li> It was just what wanted</li>
            <li> There were a couple of broken pieces and a few that broke while handling them. But overall a great price for what you get.</li>
            <li> These clips are perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use them for bows that I crochet, and I do not find the teeth to be a problem at all. I attach my bows by wrapping yarn around the middle and a dab of glue and they have held up very well! I also find that the strength of these is a lot better than I would have expected. They clamp pretty tight, so there is no slipping on the hair, even on my young child with very fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also appreciate the fast shipping time- there are many of these clips out there for about the same price where the shipping time has been up to two months. Great price, great quality, fast shipping!</li>
            <li> GOOD WHAT I NEEDED.  WE KNOW GOING TO MAKE WHAT WE LOVE BOWS.  THANK YOU FOR THE ITEM GREAT COOL</li>
            <li> Love it took a while to get but it was worth the wait..thanks</li>
            <li> super cheaply made. not even worth the money</li>
            <li> This are great, I spent many many hours looking for clips that would work for making hair clips.  Thanks.  Price is right.  Good size.</li>
            <li> It was just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Easily bent. Thin metal.</li>
            <li> Great product all Iteams accounted for and great quality and came fast than the earliest expected to arrive it came 3 or 4 days before the earliest expected date amazing !!!!!!!!! The clips are a little small if u just look at them but there perfect in ur hair I have pretty thick hair and it works great  the clips are fantastic and the best quality and the cheapest I&#x27;ve ever found them!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> These are great for bow making and other things. Great deal for the price I would buy this item again.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed with the size.  We&#x27;re trying to figure out something to do with them but honestly not worth the money nor the ridiculously long time it took to get them.  Maybe kids hair, but even that&#x27;s a stretch.  Definitely not for fine hair. They would cause a lot of breakage.</li>
            <li> These clips were a little bit smaller than I was hoping for, but overall they will work great for what I need them for. I am very happy with the purchase and highly recommend these clips. I use them for my small online business:[...]</li>
            <li> Exceptional quality for the price, but Very small. Smaller than I thought they would be. But I should have read the description more closely.</li>
            <li> Glad to have found these clips.  I had looked several places for them and could not find any.  They are perfect for bow making.</li>
            <li> Product is pretty self explanatory. It arrived just as pictured. Lots of clips included. It took f o r e v e r to arrive. If you need these immediately perhaps try another source. I didn&#x27;t, so I just waited.</li>
            <li> These are super cheap, and did not work for what I wanted. I had intended to back them on silk flowers but they did not hold up well. Bent far to easily. Just to clip back my daughters hair, they worked well, but not for my intended use.</li>
            <li> Poor quality, 20% of them breaks almost instantly out of the box. Cheap price, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This are great for my bows love them... love the price for them know I can make a lots of bows thank you... hope to shop in the future with this person.</li>
            <li> These alligator clips are great for fine hair.  They stay in my 2 year old&#x27;s hair so well that I have converted all of her bows to these clips.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: good construction: I have not had one break yet; light weight, not bulky, easy surface to glue to&lt;br /&gt;Cons: slow shipping (at least in my case) but well worth the wait, you cannot wrap ribbon around &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; part (unless you want to defeat the purpose of the teeth)</li>
            <li> a lot of clips for a great prize</li>
            <li> I found during a hair-curling session that these were much too teensy and fragile to prove their purchase value. Many of the clips broke, especially when I tried to remove them. The jagged edges snagged and pulled my hair. Unpleasant to work with, low quality, and caused me pain. Huge rip off, and absolute rubbish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I bought these. For the price you really can&#x27;t beat this. I will be buying these again</li>
            <li> For the price these are reasonably good hair clips but the internal edges are razor sharp and will cut your hair or your fingers if you don&#x27;t dull them by filing smooth with a file or maybe sanding with some sand paper. Whatever machine they use to stamp out the parts does not produce a safe edge on either the top or bottom half. The bottom half is the worst of the two.  Check closely before letting children touch them.</li>
            <li> They work great i will be buying from here again very worth the money took a lil longer to get but worth it</li>
            <li> I ordered the clips they came early. There were several broken pieces such as springs and small pieces of metal in the bag so I checked each clip to make sure they worked. They all worked, but I ordered 100 clips and only 99 were shipped. I contacted the seller who said they would resolve the issue. I have not heard back from niceEshop or received the missing piece that I paid for. Even though it was only 1 piece, it is an item that I paid for and should receive. At this point I will not do business with this seller again.</li>
            <li> Product is cheaply made. At least 30 of the clips were set crooked and therefore unusable. I found one decent one out of every five that I used. The clips were stiff to open and close at first but softened up after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for the hair bows</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> Thin aluminum.... Not what expected. Some of them give crack across after first use... The only positive thing is that there are many of them in the bag. :)</li>
            <li> Veryyyyyy poor quality</li>
            <li> Awesome!!! Great for hair bows!!!!</li>
            <li> These clips are flimsy, they crack easily &amp; break if handled after it cracks. Great price but not worth it, since I&#x27;ve  had to replace or repair several clips that I sold.</li>
            <li> Great price &amp; fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I liked these so much, I ordered some more. Just generic hair clips and a good price. I use them for hair flowers.</li>
            <li> Overall a great deal. I counted and tested each one and all 100 were there with only 3 broken. Also, I wasn&#x27;t expecting them for another week and came early. Bonus. I&#x27;m excited to start crafting! :)</li>
            <li> A few pieces arrived bent, but honestly a few broken pieces is worth the low price. Worth it for me!</li>
            <li> I love ths product, it is a great project maker.</li>
            <li> These clips are perfect for making hair accessories. One of the items I male are duct tape hair bows and I needed alligator clips that would really stay put. I have continously opened and closed these to see how much abuse they could take and each time they hold up. They are perfect for these bows and I&#x27;m sure I can find another use for them,  maybe tie clips but for now they work perfectly for hair. My customers who have these clips love how easily they go into their hair and don&#x27;t budge.</li>
            <li> Super cheap and flimsy. Several broke in my hands upon opening.</li>
            <li> I make polymer clay hair accessories and these are prefect for what I needed. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> These clips were a really good bargain. I make bows for baby girls and the price was crazy at Walmart. These are very strong too.</li>
            <li> Cheap clips but works for what I needed them for in my hobby craft.  Not sure I would use them in hair.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on here before I purchased the product, and I knew that some of the clips could arrive broken.  However, the cheapest set of clips I&#x27;ve found prior has been at Walmart, where you get 10 for 2 bucks.  So even if some of the 100 were broken, it&#x27;s still a great bargain; I&#x27;ve only had one broken one thus far.  I also don&#x27;t see a whole lot of difference in quality between these and the ones I brought at Walmart either.  They seem fairly durable.</li>
            <li> Good product great price... I recommend this seller</li>
            <li> i got a good size bag of these clips. i havent opened them but it looks like their is a 100 in the bag.</li>
            <li> These came in perfect for my flower projects I am currently working on.</li>
            <li> super awesome came like 1.5 weeks earlier. come with a hundred accurate sized clips. really good quality. none have broken</li>
            <li> I love purchasing items I can use for various creative projects in bulk! And for cheap! From what I can tell, these hold up pretty well. These are one of my top choices for hair pins that stay firmly in place. I use these for hair clips I make and they not only make the piece functional, but in a very durable manner.</li>
            <li> my g.f loved and bought this item so she can do pins i think. anyways she has no complains bleh.</li>
            <li> the only thing is that you need to be patient, takes about 1 month for it to arrival. But everything else is perfect!</li>
            <li> There were some that wasn&#x27;t well silver colored although it was alright over all. May purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> These clips are awesome for holding the binding in place on my quilts. (only for hand sewing of binding) No more sticking myself with the straight pins. I would recommend these to anyone who sews their quilt binding on by hand.</li>
            <li> I counted them and I was 2 short so I feel a little cheated there, and some of the clips were already falling apart.  It&#x27;s still cheaper to buy in bulk than it would have been to buy the little packs at other craft stores or Walmart but just beware that the quantity and quality is not at 100%.</li>
            <li> I like these clips because I got a lot for a decent price. It took a little while for me to receive them because they came from China but overall I probably waited about 2 weeks for them to come. I love these clips because they&#x27;re not too big and it makes blow drying and styling my hair so much easier then it would with me trying to use scrunchies which are a hassle and rip my hair. I would definitely recommend these clips to anyone. Great quality for the price.</li>
            <li> great deal, great quality! :):):)</li>
            <li> Woohoo... I just got my order and I&#x27;m so excited they arrived weeks before they were suppose to. Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> Product was as stated but it took over two weeks to get to me.  I was not disappointed in product just the time it took to get it.</li>
            <li> Very happy with these for the price, but when i counted them, i only got 98 in the bag and 1 clip of a different kind. Overall i am pretty happy, but the fact that the order wasn&#x27;t 100 of the alligator clips is kinda annoying.</li>
            <li> When I placed my order I did not know that it was being shipped from Hong Kong. I was really disappointed when I received the order confirmation that the delivery was about 2 months away!! If I knew that it was international and took this long, I would never placed my order with this seller. I couldn&#x27;t cancel so I thought was the heck, let it be. I didn&#x27;t even bothering waitig for it or tracking the order after. But just when I didn&#x27;t expect it, the package was at my door one day in less than 2 weeks!! That&#x27;s was a nice surprise. I love the clips. It works well for the project that I am doing which is making little hair bows and accessories for my daughter. The price is great for the quantities and qualities of it. I will definitely order again from this seller in the future despite the delivery time.</li>
            <li> These clips are not very sturdy, if you push to hard they break and are useless. I won&#x27;t order these again. I will need to look for something stronger.</li>
            <li> What can I say, they are clips and they work just fine. This was an excellent bargain.</li>
            <li> Great product! They are just as pictured and all of mine came in mint condition and not only in plastic bag but also another baggie to put them in once they&#x27;re opened so they don&#x27;t spill out everywhere.</li>
            <li> Many pieces fell apart when I used them.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to someone who needed good quality in the resulting project!</li>
            <li> a great sturdy clip very good for making bows!!</li>
            <li> I wish I had gotton some more expensive clips instead of these. They are not good quality and do not hold up. If you&#x27;re looking for something to just use once or twice, these will do, but if you&#x27;re looking to make hair clips that will last a while, I recommend getting something else. The clip bends easily, and I didn&#x27;t think that we were hard on them. They are flimsier than I&#x27;d hoped. Also straight out of the package I had to weed through the clips before I&#x27;d find a good one to use. Many of them had teeth that did not line up correctly when opened and closed, and a couple broke when I tried to open them. I would not purchase these again :(</li>
            <li> It arrived in a small box. When I took it out, the content seemed smaller than I expected, so I started counting. I found the bag inside another plastic bag was already torn open and there were only 67 pieces instead of 100 pieces.</li>
