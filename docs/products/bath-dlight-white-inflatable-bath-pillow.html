    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I have used pillows of this style for years with excellent results.</li>
            <li>This was an excellent add to my weekly detox soak.</li>
            <li>Both held air perfectly.</li>
            <li>Perfect to use while having a bubble bath.</li>
            <li>so I can get a good night&#x27;s sleep!</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s good for that!</li>
            <li>Great neck support while soaking.</li>
            <li>I love that it cradles your neck so perfectly.  </li>
            <li>If this problem is rectified, it will be a good product.</li>
            <li>Good quality so no air leaks.</li>
            <li>Buy at your own risk.</li>
            <li>So far, I haven&#x27;t had any deflation issues with this product, however it&#x27;s not the best I&#x27;ve had either</li>
            <li>After looking in all the stores and not finding exactly this blow up bath pillow, I was happy to find it on-line.</li>
            <li>Its very comfortable, however the suction cups detatch from the wall every time i put my head on it.</li>
            <li>I love the way it contoured around my head.</li>
            <li>Perfect for our deep tub.</li>
            <li>So much better than those fan or shell shaped pillows.  </li>
            <li>I liked the shape of this pillow, it was comfortable and didn&#x27;t look like a seashell or have terry cloth on it.</li>
            <li>And I use it more to prop up my books, which I read in the tub, than for anything else.  </li>
            <li>They are ok..</li>
            <li>That was the best I&#x27;ve ever had until it developed a leak after about a year&#x27;s worth of use.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure it will work fine.  </li>
            <li>This incredible bath pillow has given me my life back!</li>
            <li>I did a temporary fix (super glue) and enjoyed it for one more bath.</li>
            <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t spend more money than this, but wondering if I had, if I&#x27;d still have a useful pillow.  </li>
            <li>Also, I turned it upside down and it cradled my head perfectly as well.  </li>
            <li>It shipped out in a few days and it was perfect.</li>
            <li>Comfortable, works well in the tub.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made and not durable at all.</li>
            <li>It was cheap, around $5 I believe.</li>
            <li>I got to enjoy it for a couple of baths (literally 2).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So for $4.99 with free shipping</li>
            <li>For the price, it is a great deal for me, and I&#x27;ll just have to see how long it continues holding air.</li>
            <li>My tub is not very angled so this pillow greatly helps it become comfortable and relaxing.</li>
            <li>I bought this in spite of reading the negative reviews, and it&#x27;s a good reminder that the reviews are there for a good reason.</li>
            <li>It is soft and comfy for a nice relaxing bath.  </li>
            <li>The price is right, and it was a comfortable bath pillow for the duration of its short-lived life.  </li>
            <li>It does just what I need, comfortable head &amp; neck rest for me in the hot tub.</li>
            <li>, I guess you could say I paid $2.50 per bath to use it, which in my mind isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>I expected more since I paid for it instead of a free add on like they were trying at the time.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking to buy.</li>
            <li>The first time that I used this pillow it burst on the seam as soon as I laid my head on it.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for supplying it and providing it to me!</li>
            <li>The suctions on the back keep it from floating to the top.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rather hot made of rubber.  </li>
            <li>I basically use it like a floation device for my head instead, putting the pillow part under my neck/head and the middle unflated part at the top.  </li>
            <li>got this for my hot tub..</li>
            <li>I did get a few good uses out of it though and for the price I can&#x27;t really complain.  </li>
            <li>One suction cup does not work, but the working cup is strong enough to keep the pillow in place.</li>
            <li>The 1st 1 of these didn&#x27;t hold air, as other buyers have reported; no problem, with Amazon&#x27;s quick &amp; easy replacement process, they had a replacement here in 2 days.</li>
            <li>The hole was thanks to my dog, not poor construction.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very close to the wall</li>
            <li>I am a very tall woman, and when I relax in my tub, my head hits the wall.  </li>
            <li>Ships fast.     </li>
            <li>For the price and compared to other bath pillows i have used im satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I sincerely loved this little pillow until it got a tiny hole in it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the second one I have had - the first one just wore out.</li>
            <li>After using this 3 times, it developed a rather large hole on the back where it was sealed together.  </li>
            <li>The suction cups are placed too far apart and will not stay stuck on the tub when I place my head there.</li>
            <li>but once you lean back into it, it doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li>But unless I nearly inflate it to nothing, it keeps your head too far forward.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, there were two small holes in the seam.</li>
            <li>I will be buying these again as I&#x27;m sure they will only last a little while.  </li>
            <li>Will probably buy another one in the near future.</li>
            <li>Two of these pillows lasted less than 3 months of weekly use after both springing leaks--apparently the plastic used is not nearly durable enough for even just the benign tub use for which they are claimed to be useful.  </li>
            <li>Although these seem a little bit thinner plastic than the old pillow I had for the past 20 years or so, they are just fine.</li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;ve only had them for a couple weeks, so I don&#x27;t know if they will eventually develop cracks in the plastic where the wrinkles naturally occur (like my old one did after a couple decades), but I&#x27;m guessing that if I bring them inside from the spa each time, they ought not to break down from exposure to UV from sunlight for quite a while.</li>

            <li> The next morning, it was flat.</li>
            <li> Blowing it up is hard and the suckion cups don&#x27;t stay on very well.  </li>
            <li> My only -- very minor -- complaint is that these have a fairly smooth texture, and I actually preferred the sort of fake woven surface texture of my old inflatable spa pillow.</li>
            <li> Then my head stays above water, but I can basically lay down fully in my tub</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve only used it a few times.  </li>
            <li> Then the suction cups do not work at all, they must be older than I am, the cupping part actually is bent the wrong way to stick to anything.</li>
            <li> The other design flaw is in the nozzle used to blow these up.  </li>
            <li> I was not able to blow it up, my husband finally got it blown up.</li>
            <li> The small internal plastic flap designed to prevent the backflow of air is virtually impossible to force open simply by blowing air in--you have to physically force it open with a toothpick or other small rod, then try to keep it open by pinching the inside of the tube as you are inflating the pillows.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just your average bath pillow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it less than 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these, and because one or two people had complained about receiving leaky pillows, I immediately inflated both and left them on the table for a couple days with a heavy book on each to check for leaks.</li>
            <li> However, I had a pillow previously that you could either blow up or fill with hot or cold water.  </li>
            <li> The inside surfaces stuck tightly together.</li>
            <li> Then I noticed that it had deflated a little.</li>
            <li> It did come with one of those little squares of &#x27;repair&#x27; plastic</li>
            <li> These were a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Not comfortable.</li>
            <li> Blowing it up was a little hard to do.</li>
            <li> and, needless to say, it split at the seams: not just one or two holes, which I glued, but numerous holes all around.</li>
            <li> This pillow was a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> I should have heeded the negative reviews before buying them myself.  </li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty pathetic that it already is losing air.</li>
            <li> These have a flaw in their design which renders them useless.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to inflate.</li>
            <li> Disappointed and threw the pillow away.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very difficult to inflate. The inside surfaces stuck tightly together. May try a bicycle pump. Would not recommend this item</li>
            <li> I sincerely loved this little pillow until it got a tiny hole in it. The hole was thanks to my dog, not poor construction. I love the way it contoured around my head. Perfect for our deep tub. Will probably buy another one in the near future.</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these and returned them immediately. The suction cups are placed too far apart and will not stay stuck on the tub when I place my head there. If this problem is rectified, it will be a good product. I have used pillows of this style for years with excellent results. These have a flaw in their design which renders them useless.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking to buy. After looking in all the stores and not finding exactly this blow up bath pillow, I was happy to find it on-line. It shipped out in a few days and it was perfect.</li>
            <li> Comfortable, works well in the tub. It&#x27;s the second one I have had - the first one just wore out.</li>
            <li> This pillow was a big disappointment. The first time that I used this pillow it burst on the seam as soon as I laid my head on it.</li>
            <li> I use this pillow whenever i read in the bath tub. Its very comfortable, however the suction cups detatch from the wall every time i put my head on it. For the price and compared to other bath pillows i have used im satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> So much better than those fan or shell shaped pillows.  I have a deep soaking jetted tub and it&#x27;s very close to the wall (only about 3-4 inches).  I am a very tall woman, and when I relax in my tub, my head hits the wall.  This is a life saver for me.  I love that it cradles your neck so perfectly.  Also, I turned it upside down and it cradled my head perfectly as well.  I will be buying these again as I&#x27;m sure they will only last a little while.  As affordable as they are, I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> These were a waste of money.  I should have heeded the negative reviews before buying them myself.  Two of these pillows lasted less than 3 months of weekly use after both springing leaks--apparently the plastic used is not nearly durable enough for even just the benign tub use for which they are claimed to be useful.  The other design flaw is in the nozzle used to blow these up.  The small internal plastic flap designed to prevent the backflow of air is virtually impossible to force open simply by blowing air in--you have to physically force it open with a toothpick or other small rod, then try to keep it open by pinching the inside of the tube as you are inflating the pillows.  Anyone know of truly durable inflatable bath pillows?  The last ones we had lasted for about 10 years, but I can&#x27;t remember the source.</li>
            <li> There was a hole in it and they wouldn&#x27;t replace it. I expected more since I paid for it instead of a free add on like they were trying at the time.</li>
            <li> For the price, this product delivers on its promise.  It is soft and comfy for a nice relaxing bath.  The suction cups don&#x27;t always stick to the side of the tub but once you lean back into it, it doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li> Not comfortable. Would not stay in place on side of tub. Cheaply made and not durable at all. Lasted about 2 days for me until it wouldnt hold air.</li>
            <li> This incredible bath pillow has given me my life back! I am disable and it helps me relax in my bathtub at night so I can get a good night&#x27;s sleep! Thank you so much for supplying it and providing it to me! I am forever grateful!</li>
            <li> Product was delivered timely under Prime membership.  The bath pillow was the design I preferred but began leaking as soon as it was inflated.  Found a hole in the seam but it could not be repaired.  Disappointed and threw the pillow away.  Hope to find something that will work and not leak.</li>
            <li> The price is right, and it was a comfortable bath pillow for the duration of its short-lived life.  I&#x27;ve had it less than 2 weeks and it has a noticeable hole, and leaks.  Glad I didn&#x27;t spend more money than this, but wondering if I had, if I&#x27;d still have a useful pillow.  It&#x27;s pretty pathetic that it already is losing air.</li>
            <li> This was an excellent add to my weekly detox soak. Great neck support while soaking. Took my relaxation experience to the next level. I have used it several times. One suction cup does not work, but the working cup is strong enough to keep the pillow in place.</li>
            <li> Bought two of these, and both of them broke and deflated within a week of purchase.</li>
            <li> My tub is not very angled so this pillow greatly helps it become comfortable and relaxing. The suctions on the back keep it from floating to the top.</li>
            <li> It was cheap, around $5 I believe. It came with Amazon Prime shipping. I got to enjoy it for a couple of baths (literally 2). Blowing it up was a little hard to do. Then I noticed that it had deflated a little. I blew it up again and checked for bubbles. Sure enough, there were two small holes in the seam. I did a temporary fix (super glue) and enjoyed it for one more bath. The next morning, it was flat. This time, there was a tear in the seam in a different spot. &#x3D;( I haven&#x27;t tried to fix it yet.    Pros: It floats. It&#x27;s cheap. Ships fast.     Cons: It&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> After using this 3 times, it developed a rather large hole on the back where it was sealed together.  Not good.</li>
            <li> I bought this in spite of reading the negative reviews, and it&#x27;s a good reminder that the reviews are there for a good reason. I used it twice and, needless to say, it split at the seams: not just one or two holes, which I glued, but numerous holes all around. Total Swiss cheese.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for $4.99 with free shipping, I guess you could say I paid $2.50 per bath to use it, which in my mind isn&#x27;t worth it. Buy at your own risk.</li>
            <li> The 1st 1 of these didn&#x27;t hold air, as other buyers have reported; no problem, with Amazon&#x27;s quick &amp; easy replacement process, they had a replacement here in 2 days. It does just what I need, comfortable head &amp; neck rest for me in the hot tub. For the price, it is a great deal for me, and I&#x27;ll just have to see how long it continues holding air.</li>
            <li> I liked the shape of this pillow, it was comfortable and didn&#x27;t look like a seashell or have terry cloth on it. But it only lasted a week. It did come with one of those little squares of &#x27;repair&#x27; plastic but I don&#x27;t have the drawer space to hold on to those kinda things so it ended up being cut up and used as barbie clothes by kids.</li>
            <li> I did get a few good uses out of it though and for the price I can&#x27;t really complain.  It&#x27;s just your average bath pillow.</li>
            <li> I have tried to use this pillow in the tub. But unless I nearly inflate it to nothing, it keeps your head too far forward. It&#x27;s rather hot made of rubber.  And I use it more to prop up my books, which I read in the tub, than for anything else.  I put the pillow on my stomach, and put books on the pillow to read. Now it&#x27;s good for that!</li>
            <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t had any deflation issues with this product, however it&#x27;s not the best I&#x27;ve had either and I&#x27;ve only used it a few times.  Blowing it up is hard and the suckion cups don&#x27;t stay on very well.  I basically use it like a floation device for my head instead, putting the pillow part under my neck/head and the middle unflated part at the top.  Then my head stays above water, but I can basically lay down fully in my tub (I have a 6&#x27; jetted tub, so room to stretch).  However, I had a pillow previously that you could either blow up or fill with hot or cold water.  That was the best I&#x27;ve ever had until it developed a leak after about a year&#x27;s worth of use.</li>
            <li> I was not able to blow it up, my husband finally got it blown up. Then the suction cups do not work at all, they must be older than I am, the cupping part actually is bent the wrong way to stick to anything. Will see if I can return these.</li>
            <li> Although these seem a little bit thinner plastic than the old pillow I had for the past 20 years or so, they are just fine. I ordered two of these, and because one or two people had complained about receiving leaky pillows, I immediately inflated both and left them on the table for a couple days with a heavy book on each to check for leaks. Both held air perfectly. Now, I&#x27;ve only had them for a couple weeks, so I don&#x27;t know if they will eventually develop cracks in the plastic where the wrinkles naturally occur (like my old one did after a couple decades), but I&#x27;m guessing that if I bring them inside from the spa each time, they ought not to break down from exposure to UV from sunlight for quite a while. My only -- very minor -- complaint is that these have a fairly smooth texture, and I actually preferred the sort of fake woven surface texture of my old inflatable spa pillow. Oh well.</li>
            <li> Havent use yet but I&#x27;m sure it will work fine.  I just like something to lean back on when taking a bath.,</li>
            <li> got this for my hot tub.. two of them.. They are ok.. suction doesn&#x27;t always hold it to the wall...</li>
            <li> I blew it up and it did not even last through one bath!  It split apart at the seam like it was not fused together well.</li>
            <li> Sticks well to tub and wall. Doesn&#x27;t smell. Good quality so no air leaks. Perfect to use while having a bubble bath.</li>
