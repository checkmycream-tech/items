            <li>This antifungal soap has eliminated the problem and I&#x27;m so much more comfortable, now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used this as a face wash every so often, as tea tree oil is a great natural serum for your skin and for acne.</li>

            <li>This really makes me feel good.</li>

            <li>I think it&#x27;s working... want to give a couple more weeks before I give a full report.  </li>
            <li>Very fresh scent and clean feeling!</li>
            <li>The Antifungal Soap is the perfect blend of effectiveness and less scent.</li>
            <li>It makes your feet feel refreshed and makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li>It smells great and you can use it freely on your entire body.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This  is a cheap  copy of  Funga Soap.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s genuine.</li>
            <li>and she loves how smooth her skin was in her words</li>
            <li>So happy to have finally found a product that works.</li>
            <li>Overall the products seemed much more natural than the brand name chemical creams but best of all IT WORKED.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>What I realize during the middle of the week that it&#x27;s very effective with a wash cloth, it&#x27;s the lather that makes a difference.</li>
            <li>Bottom line, this has so far worked better than any prescription medicine, which is surprising because I have found most natural products are ineffective.</li>
            <li>I saw a difference after the first use, and now my feet look and feel so much better</li>
            <li>Got this originally for athletes foot.</li>
            <li>I am so far very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>As far as the vendor, I could not be more pleased.  </li>
            <li>The staff is also very attentive and they seem like they really care about their customers.</li>
            <li>I love this so much</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell , this is quite effective.  </li>
            <li>It smells good and I will definitely keep it around for precautionary washes after the gym.</li>
            <li>I am going to order more of this product as I really like it.</li>
            <li>I have a drawer full of prescription medicines and cremes  </li>
            <li>Every time I take a shower it is something I look forward to in my day to know that I am going to feel clean, fresh, and like</li>
            <li>Actually smells pretty good and leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>and I really appreciate the company&#x27;s direct communication to be sure I am a satisfied customer.  </li>
            <li>After my first shower with the product I got significant relief.  </li>
            <li>I changed the top to a small pump because it&#x27;s much easier to use that way, but the product is great.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m already seeing a great imporvement in just a few days of using this.  </li>
            <li>Fungal problems are anything but fun.  </li>
            <li>And it has a fresh peppermint scent.  </li>
            <li>This product proves that.</li>
            <li>Their quality and labeling assured me that I was buying the right product, without spending oodles of money doing it.</li>
            <li>the job right</li>
            <li>I needed it right away, did not mention that</li>
            <li>I started using the aunt fungal body wash right as soon as I received it.</li>
            <li>As soon as I received the item I used it right away.</li>
            <li>I use it as a gave and body wash and it really helps get you clean.  </li>
            <li>Really helps my skin feel clean without drying.  </li>
            <li>I personally think you will still have to use some sort of antifungal spray or powder, etc..to completely get rid of athletes feet, but this is a great start, and much more proven than regular soap.</li>
            <li>that ruins the appeal of good products.  </li>
            <li>super gentle and just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>what I really appreciated was how quick they were to get this product to me.</li>
            <li>But other than that I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;the way it makes my skin feel and the smell is hard to describe, like it wakes my skin up, and i feel so clean and good</li>
            <li>Excellent product a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>and you will see results I also combine with tea tree oil and selsun blue apply in shower for 5 minutes or more.</li>
            <li>have not used enough to know for sure yet</li>
            <li>I have been using a different product, but like this one much more.  </li>
            <li>I am a massage therapist and am always concerned with potentially picking up a fungus or skin irritation from clients (depite how meticulous I am with hand and arm washing) and have more peace of mind in using this product.</li>
            <li>I will most definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I COULD swear by this product, as I have used it to shower for the last week, and most of the fungus on my skin is GONE!!!!!!WOW..</li>
            <li>it smelled good but not sure it was worth it.</li>
            <li>Got to say this item does help with most fungus problems such as athletes feet and jock itch.</li>
            <li>and i don&#x27;t remember the last time I saw his feet look better.</li>
            <li>I think I have found exactly what works for me.  </li>
            <li>It instantly cools the infected area and makes it feel better.</li>
            <li>Pretty good stuff, cleared up a case of athlete&#x27;s foot in a few days.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works in conjunction with Pure Tree Oil!  </li>
            <li>Very soothing, calming, and refreshing for me; I suffered an allergic reaction to insect bites, and this was recommended by my dermatologist, as fungal infections may result from scratching; the tea tree oil smell is very deep, meaning I know</li>
            <li>Works fast to get rid of skin ickies, smells fresh, and you don&#x27;t have to use much at a time.  </li>
            <li>As far as I am concerned, this is a great product that I plan to use as my regular soap (hoping to prevent future fungal infections).  </li>
            <li>It was nice receiving a follow up email from the seller however, they should consider giving the buyer a few days to actually use the product to be able to give feedback.</li>
            <li>long lasting good smell...</li>
            <li>Purely Northwest Anti-Fungal Foot &amp; Body Wash</li>
            <li>Thank you, Purely Northwest for checking in on me.</li>
            <li>I chose to dilute it with pure filtered water and put it in a spray bottle.</li>
            <li>Then large ace bandage wraps for swelling and to protect the compromised skin.</li>
            <li>It takes care of athlete&#x27;s foot for certain.  </li>
            <li>big problem .. need other differnt kind of that not with Tea Tree oil cause yeast and health effect!</li>
            <li>My thanks to Purely Northwest.  </li>
            <li>This soap has been great to help with the skin fungus that I thought I had as well as itchy, dry feet, and some other issues.  </li>
            <li>really helped alleviate the problem.  </li>
            <li>very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Works really well.  </li>
            <li>Thank-you so much.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t getting much results until the 7th day.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>The company seems to stand by their product and really care about what the consumers think.  </li>
            <li>I picked this up and switched the OTC anti-fungal I was using and knocked it out fast.</li>
            <li>I use this to to wash my face and whole body.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I spotted your antifungal soap and used both products as part of my daily routine.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>reacruing skin problem fast</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend that you try this!</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I get hours of real relief.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for all!</li>
            <li>I cannot believe how fast it works.</li>
            <li>It seems to be effective, but I won&#x27;t know until I use it for a few months.</li>
            <li>smells good not strong, does help keep feet skin soft.</li>
            <li>It has a strong medicinal smell-but it does not linger long.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend soap &amp; Purely Northwest.</li>
            <li>Works instantly and leaves your feet feeling clean.</li>
            <li>It is true you have to use a  sponge because the product only frothed when used with them</li>
            <li>/&gt;using it in combination with an antifungal cream, so far seems to be working well, at the very least its a great body wash.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a soothing, nicely scented, gentle and cleansing body wash that would also benefit my skin while I go through a completion of other various treatments for Lyme disease and skin disorders.</li>
            <li>2 months later - I really tried to use it but got fed up with getting the gel out of the bottle and the powerful odor.</li>
            <li>This was easier for me to handle and use in the shower for my particular condition.  </li>
            <li>(And to be fair, I took a few days off last week because of vacation).</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a good product, and I am sure works well, and overall, I think it does, but not sure if it is this soap or also in combination of the other things I am using.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I saw major difference after first time use .  </li>
            <li>and I wish it had a little better lather.</li>
            <li>I would recommend Purely Northwest products to anyone looking for a better quality and not overwhelming body wash/product experience.</li>
            <li>The wash contains a variety of natural oils that really calmed the irratated area.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So far in my experience with this soap is reasonable.</li>
            <li>Really gentle on sensitive or irritated skin.</li>
            <li>my skin finally found something useful to it&#x27;s issues.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t get rid of it with the product I normally use.</li>
            <li>Husband loves it, he uses it as a regular body wash and he says it leaves him feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>I love the blend of scents but not sure how much it helped with a fungal outbreak</li>
            <li>When I first got this I was expecting it to be bigger, but after using it ad seeing the quality of the product I absolutely think it is worth it, ive only just started using it</li>
            <li>I have some serious skin issues and am hypersensitive to many fungi on this planet!</li>
            <li>I smells amazing, its made me generally less gross.</li>
            <li>His feet are showing definite signs of improvement and the fact that he can use it while showering makes daily treatment easy.  </li>
            <li>it is his new shower soap.</li>
            <li>This literally &amp;#34;cleans the slate&amp;#34; so your under arm can smell new each time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used straight Tea Tree Oil in the past, but the smell is so strong that I can&#x27;t take my shoes off without being overpowered.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I have go use it more often, but I&#x27;m not sure what is suppose to happen to my feet after using but nothing happened.</li>
            <li>later I decided to inform my doctor exactly what I would be doing at home.</li>
            <li>Keeps my feet fresh and dry in sandals.</li>
            <li>I like natural, organic ingredients as I am allergic to many things artificial and pharmaceutical- which was part of my problem with even the most gentle standard hospital treatments.  </li>
            <li>Not exactly the kind of thing you want to publicly admit to buying or using, much less reviewing, but it really worked for me.</li>
            <li>Will upgrade to 5 stars when feet are clear.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Helped clear my skin in one week after I started using the soap.</li>
            <li>Get used to tea tree smell and it helps clear a lot of skin issues.</li>
            <li>Was helpful to clear up fungus or just get a cleaner feeling.</li>
            <li>After about three weeks I was completely clear.  </li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>it works really well, especially for me</li>
            <li>but it does lather well and rinse off completely.</li>
            <li>Been using it for over a week, nearly every day, and my athletes foot is gone.</li>
            <li>Its probably too early to tell</li>
            <li>Wish it had some form of Axe or Old Spice scent into it</li>
            <li>My husband says he loves this soap and so far, it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>l used this as a whole body wash, l literally know use everyday because it leaves feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy a couple bottles at a time since bottle isn&#x27;t that big and if you shower everyday, it could be done in a month or sooner depending on how many showers you take.</li>
            <li>I got this for jock itch primarily, which I think has helped, but not entirely sure.</li>
            <li>This product left a burning sensation on new skin.</li>
            <li>The wash helped clean and calm my irritated fungal infection from the very first wash, and helped me feel less icky --due to having a fungal infection on my leg.  </li>
            <li>I would wash my groin area twice a day with this product and then completely dry the are (I used a hair dryer much to the chagrin of my GF) and then apply the Aloe Vesta ointment.  </li>
            <li>The only recomendation would be to make the dispenser hole slightly smaller so not as much product comes out.</li>
            <li>but it came right back after two prescription tries.  </li>
            <li>I love this wash, but the bottle is very hard to squeeze.</li>
            <li>Much less itchy right now, so I suppose it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my friend who has tried everything for his athletes foot with little success.</li>
            <li>I like it as a general body wash too.  </li>
            <li>it worked to clear up white blotches on my skin that were caused by a fungus.</li>
            <li>It helps if you have smelly under arms and using natural deodorants, especially during the summer.</li>
            <li>Natural, essential oils are the way to go.</li>
            <li>I chose this product for natural ingredients and reviews that addressed actual fungal issues that were helped, rather than the smell or</li>
            <li>I decided to take a different course of action and got this Tea Tree soap and also  Aloe Vesta Antifungal Ointment.  </li>
            <li>l ordered this and the smell literally went down to a point where l could not smell anything unless l really tried and my foot is so clear of the fungus.</li>
            <li>I am recovering from a crazy case of cellulitis, and am unsure what might have started it--fungus is suspect but because there is no obvious wound or obvious fungal issue is also unconfirmed--have been on crazy antibiotics for over a month which create their own issues especially in warm creases when you are asked to always sit with your leg elevated and need to be careful with compromised skin.</li>
            <li>WHatever the positive medicinal qualities, it&#x27;s not worth the hastle.</li>
            <li>Very soothing and is relieving my itch due to fungus.</li>
            <li>I was sleepless 3 nights ago due to my very itchy toe.</li>
            <li>I live in a hot and humid climate, and after a long day in the heat I sometimes get a little irritated in the crease under my tummy.</li>
            <li>I used all the over the counter chemical products such as Lamisil and they would help clear it up over a period of time but it kept coming back.  </li>
            <li>I developed a serious &amp;#34;rash&amp;#34; under both arms and figured a mild steroid (cortisone cream) might fix it.  </li>
            <li>However, it hasn&#x27;t completely taken away the dry skin on parts of my foot...</li>
            <li>I can barely tell there is an issue now, when only a week before use my toenails were covered in blotchy white marks and were yellowing.</li>
            <li>Very soothing to irritated areas where tight clothing chafes.  </li>

            <li> This antifungal soap has eliminated the problem and I&#x27;m so much more comfortable, now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used this as a face wash every so often, as tea tree oil is a great natural serum for your skin and for acne.</li>
            <li> Improvement could be seen by the end of the first week of use and I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li> This really makes me feel good.</li>

            <li> I think it&#x27;s working... want to give a couple more weeks before I give a full report.  </li>
            <li> Very fresh scent and clean feeling!</li>
            <li> The Antifungal Soap is the perfect blend of effectiveness and less scent.</li>
            <li> It makes your feet feel refreshed and makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li> It smells great and you can use it freely on your entire body.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This  is a cheap  copy of  Funga Soap.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s genuine.</li>
            <li> and she loves how smooth her skin was in her words</li>
            <li> So happy to have finally found a product that works.</li>
            <li> Overall the products seemed much more natural than the brand name chemical creams but best of all IT WORKED.</li>
            <li> Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> What I realize during the middle of the week that it&#x27;s very effective with a wash cloth, it&#x27;s the lather that makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Bottom line, this has so far worked better than any prescription medicine, which is surprising because I have found most natural products are ineffective.</li>
            <li> I saw a difference after the first use, and now my feet look and feel so much better</li>
            <li> Got this originally for athletes foot.</li>
            <li> I am so far very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> As far as the vendor, I could not be more pleased.  </li>
            <li> The staff is also very attentive and they seem like they really care about their customers.</li>
            <li> I love this so much</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell , this is quite effective.  </li>
            <li> It smells good and I will definitely keep it around for precautionary washes after the gym.</li>
            <li> I am going to order more of this product as I really like it.</li>
            <li> I have a drawer full of prescription medicines and cremes  </li>
            <li> Every time I take a shower it is something I look forward to in my day to know that I am going to feel clean, fresh, and like</li>
            <li> Actually smells pretty good and leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> and I really appreciate the company&#x27;s direct communication to be sure I am a satisfied customer.  </li>
            <li> After my first shower with the product I got significant relief.  </li>
            <li> I changed the top to a small pump because it&#x27;s much easier to use that way, but the product is great.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m already seeing a great imporvement in just a few days of using this.  </li>
            <li> Fungal problems are anything but fun.  </li>
            <li> And it has a fresh peppermint scent.  </li>
            <li> This product proves that.</li>
            <li> Their quality and labeling assured me that I was buying the right product, without spending oodles of money doing it.</li>
            <li> the job right</li>
            <li> I needed it right away, did not mention that</li>
            <li> I started using the aunt fungal body wash right as soon as I received it.</li>
            <li> As soon as I received the item I used it right away.</li>
            <li> I use it as a gave and body wash and it really helps get you clean.  </li>
            <li> Really helps my skin feel clean without drying.  </li>
            <li> I personally think you will still have to use some sort of antifungal spray or powder, etc..to completely get rid of athletes feet, but this is a great start, and much more proven than regular soap.</li>
            <li> that ruins the appeal of good products.  </li>
            <li> super gentle and just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> what I really appreciated was how quick they were to get this product to me.</li>
            <li> But other than that I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;the way it makes my skin feel and the smell is hard to describe, like it wakes my skin up, and i feel so clean and good</li>
            <li> Excellent product a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and you will see results I also combine with tea tree oil and selsun blue apply in shower for 5 minutes or more.</li>
            <li> have not used enough to know for sure yet</li>
            <li> I have been using a different product, but like this one much more.  </li>
            <li> I am a massage therapist and am always concerned with potentially picking up a fungus or skin irritation from clients (depite how meticulous I am with hand and arm washing) and have more peace of mind in using this product.</li>
            <li> I will most definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I COULD swear by this product, as I have used it to shower for the last week, and most of the fungus on my skin is GONE!!!!!!WOW..</li>
            <li> it smelled good but not sure it was worth it.</li>
            <li> Got to say this item does help with most fungus problems such as athletes feet and jock itch.</li>
            <li> and i don&#x27;t remember the last time I saw his feet look better.</li>
            <li> I think I have found exactly what works for me.  </li>
            <li> It instantly cools the infected area and makes it feel better.</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff, cleared up a case of athlete&#x27;s foot in a few days.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really works in conjunction with Pure Tree Oil!  </li>
            <li> Very soothing, calming, and refreshing for me; I suffered an allergic reaction to insect bites, and this was recommended by my dermatologist, as fungal infections may result from scratching; the tea tree oil smell is very deep, meaning I know</li>
            <li> Works fast to get rid of skin ickies, smells fresh, and you don&#x27;t have to use much at a time.  </li>
            <li> As far as I am concerned, this is a great product that I plan to use as my regular soap (hoping to prevent future fungal infections).  </li>
            <li> It was nice receiving a follow up email from the seller however, they should consider giving the buyer a few days to actually use the product to be able to give feedback.</li>
            <li> long lasting good smell...</li>
            <li> Purely Northwest Anti-Fungal Foot &amp; Body Wash</li>
            <li> Thank you, Purely Northwest for checking in on me.</li>
            <li> I chose to dilute it with pure filtered water and put it in a spray bottle.</li>
            <li> Then large ace bandage wraps for swelling and to protect the compromised skin.</li>
            <li> It takes care of athlete&#x27;s foot for certain.  </li>
            <li> big problem .. need other differnt kind of that not with Tea Tree oil cause yeast and health effect!</li>
            <li> My thanks to Purely Northwest.  </li>
            <li> This soap has been great to help with the skin fungus that I thought I had as well as itchy, dry feet, and some other issues.  </li>
            <li> really helped alleviate the problem.  </li>
            <li> very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Works really well.  </li>
            <li> Thank-you so much.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t getting much results until the 7th day.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> The company seems to stand by their product and really care about what the consumers think.  </li>
            <li> I picked this up and switched the OTC anti-fungal I was using and knocked it out fast.</li>
            <li> I use this to to wash my face and whole body.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I spotted your antifungal soap and used both products as part of my daily routine.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> reacruing skin problem fast</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend that you try this!</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I get hours of real relief.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for all!</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how fast it works.</li>
            <li> It seems to be effective, but I won&#x27;t know until I use it for a few months.</li>
            <li> smells good not strong, does help keep feet skin soft.</li>
            <li> It has a strong medicinal smell-but it does not linger long.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend soap &amp; Purely Northwest.</li>
            <li> Works instantly and leaves your feet feeling clean.</li>
            <li> It is true you have to use a  sponge because the product only frothed when used with them</li>
            <li> /&gt;using it in combination with an antifungal cream, so far seems to be working well, at the very least its a great body wash.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a soothing, nicely scented, gentle and cleansing body wash that would also benefit my skin while I go through a completion of other various treatments for Lyme disease and skin disorders.</li>
            <li> 2 months later - I really tried to use it but got fed up with getting the gel out of the bottle and the powerful odor.</li>
            <li> This was easier for me to handle and use in the shower for my particular condition.  </li>
            <li> (And to be fair, I took a few days off last week because of vacation).</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a good product, and I am sure works well, and overall, I think it does, but not sure if it is this soap or also in combination of the other things I am using.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I saw major difference after first time use .  </li>
            <li> and I wish it had a little better lather.</li>
            <li> I would recommend Purely Northwest products to anyone looking for a better quality and not overwhelming body wash/product experience.</li>
            <li> The wash contains a variety of natural oils that really calmed the irratated area.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So far in my experience with this soap is reasonable.</li>
            <li> Really gentle on sensitive or irritated skin.</li>
            <li> my skin finally found something useful to it&#x27;s issues.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t get rid of it with the product I normally use.</li>
            <li> Husband loves it, he uses it as a regular body wash and he says it leaves him feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> I love the blend of scents but not sure how much it helped with a fungal outbreak</li>
            <li> When I first got this I was expecting it to be bigger, but after using it ad seeing the quality of the product I absolutely think it is worth it, ive only just started using it</li>
            <li> I have some serious skin issues and am hypersensitive to many fungi on this planet!</li>
            <li> I smells amazing, its made me generally less gross.</li>
            <li> His feet are showing definite signs of improvement and the fact that he can use it while showering makes daily treatment easy.  </li>
            <li> it is his new shower soap.</li>
            <li> This literally &amp;#34;cleans the slate&amp;#34; so your under arm can smell new each time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used straight Tea Tree Oil in the past, but the smell is so strong that I can&#x27;t take my shoes off without being overpowered.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I have go use it more often, but I&#x27;m not sure what is suppose to happen to my feet after using but nothing happened.</li>
            <li> later I decided to inform my doctor exactly what I would be doing at home.</li>
            <li> Keeps my feet fresh and dry in sandals.</li>
            <li> I like natural, organic ingredients as I am allergic to many things artificial and pharmaceutical- which was part of my problem with even the most gentle standard hospital treatments.  </li>
            <li> Not exactly the kind of thing you want to publicly admit to buying or using, much less reviewing, but it really worked for me.</li>
            <li> Will upgrade to 5 stars when feet are clear.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Helped clear my skin in one week after I started using the soap.</li>
            <li> Get used to tea tree smell and it helps clear a lot of skin issues.</li>
            <li> Was helpful to clear up fungus or just get a cleaner feeling.</li>
            <li> After about three weeks I was completely clear.  </li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> it works really well, especially for me</li>
            <li> but it does lather well and rinse off completely.</li>
            <li> Been using it for over a week, nearly every day, and my athletes foot is gone.</li>
            <li> Its probably too early to tell</li>
            <li> Wish it had some form of Axe or Old Spice scent into it</li>
            <li> My husband says he loves this soap and so far, it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> l used this as a whole body wash, l literally know use everyday because it leaves feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy a couple bottles at a time since bottle isn&#x27;t that big and if you shower everyday, it could be done in a month or sooner depending on how many showers you take.</li>
            <li> I got this for jock itch primarily, which I think has helped, but not entirely sure.</li>
            <li> This product left a burning sensation on new skin.</li>
            <li> The wash helped clean and calm my irritated fungal infection from the very first wash, and helped me feel less icky --due to having a fungal infection on my leg.  </li>
            <li> I would wash my groin area twice a day with this product and then completely dry the are (I used a hair dryer much to the chagrin of my GF) and then apply the Aloe Vesta ointment.  </li>
            <li> The only recomendation would be to make the dispenser hole slightly smaller so not as much product comes out.</li>
            <li> but it came right back after two prescription tries.  </li>
            <li> I love this wash, but the bottle is very hard to squeeze.</li>
            <li> Much less itchy right now, so I suppose it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my friend who has tried everything for his athletes foot with little success.</li>
            <li> I like it as a general body wash too.  </li>
            <li> it worked to clear up white blotches on my skin that were caused by a fungus.</li>
            <li> It helps if you have smelly under arms and using natural deodorants, especially during the summer.</li>
            <li> Natural, essential oils are the way to go.</li>
            <li> I chose this product for natural ingredients and reviews that addressed actual fungal issues that were helped, rather than the smell or</li>
            <li> I decided to take a different course of action and got this Tea Tree soap and also  Aloe Vesta Antifungal Ointment.  </li>
            <li> l ordered this and the smell literally went down to a point where l could not smell anything unless l really tried and my foot is so clear of the fungus.</li>
            <li> I am recovering from a crazy case of cellulitis, and am unsure what might have started it--fungus is suspect but because there is no obvious wound or obvious fungal issue is also unconfirmed--have been on crazy antibiotics for over a month which create their own issues especially in warm creases when you are asked to always sit with your leg elevated and need to be careful with compromised skin.</li>
            <li> WHatever the positive medicinal qualities, it&#x27;s not worth the hastle.</li>
            <li> Very soothing and is relieving my itch due to fungus.</li>
            <li> I was sleepless 3 nights ago due to my very itchy toe.</li>
            <li> I live in a hot and humid climate, and after a long day in the heat I sometimes get a little irritated in the crease under my tummy.</li>
            <li> I used all the over the counter chemical products such as Lamisil and they would help clear it up over a period of time but it kept coming back.  </li>
            <li> I developed a serious &amp;#34;rash&amp;#34; under both arms and figured a mild steroid (cortisone cream) might fix it.  </li>
            <li> However, it hasn&#x27;t completely taken away the dry skin on parts of my foot...</li>
            <li> I can barely tell there is an issue now, when only a week before use my toenails were covered in blotchy white marks and were yellowing.</li>
            <li> Very soothing to irritated areas where tight clothing chafes.  </li>
            <li> At the suggestion of another reviewer, I also use it weekly to wash my under arms and it completely removes any funk left behind from the daily use of deodorant that sometimes doesn&#x27;t smell so fresh.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your skin dry right after u toilet down and last long enough for additional items u wish to use.</li>
            <li> I developed a fungal infection on both legs due to the antibiotics I was taking.</li>
            <li> My dry skin cleared up seemingly overnight and foot odors only took one use.</li>
            <li> The mild soap I always use made it worse.  </li>
            <li> I used an antifungal ointment that seemed to clear it up a little, but I decided to buy this wash to kill the fungus faster.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really have a foot issue before, or at least I didn&#x27;t think I did</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I developed a small red itchy patch on my foot.</li>
            <li> , I have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t do harsh products.</li>
            <li> as I aged I found I needed a floor foot scrubber to properly wash my feet without bending over in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a long time...will buy again.</li>
            <li> l have been waiting for 30 days to write a review as l wanted to write a review based on observations l had while using it over a long period of time.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take long for the soap to help relieve irritated, reddened skin and is quite soothing.</li>
            <li> the tea tree is very subtle and dissipates quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have problem feet, and am constantly battling athlete&#x27;s foot, rough dry skin, itching, etc.  </li>
            <li> Some of the most noticeable improvement for me has been on the back of one very expensive bio-available drug, lots of lyposomal vitamin C, probiotics, digestive enzymes, diluted apple cider vinegar rinses, showers with this product, and tea tree oil/vitamin E carefully applied directly to dry skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t over use as the tea tree will dry you out.</li>
            <li> it smells a little weird, the only reason for four star, but it works fine after a weeks use.</li>
            <li> but the seal was loose under the cap.</li>
            <li> My condition is not as bad as some, but this soap helps with the dry cracking skin for sure.</li>
            <li> When they start to flair, I use a little extra and leave it on for a longer of period of time, and it seems to take care of it.  </li>
            <li> After close to 3 months of using the product and no other changes in lifestyle, I have had very few problems with rashes.</li>
            <li> We have to wear closed shoes at work, even in summer.</li>
            <li> But I have only been using it a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Of the two medicated anti-fungal powders I tried, one had miconazole, the other had calcium undecylenate.  </li>
            <li> (I now use it every other day in the shower with a foot scrub brush).  </li>
            <li> I found this small business online, and I would not have it any differently!</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t getting any results from other products.  </li>
            <li> I have had a problem with one small toe and big toe for years and</li>
            <li> I had this long time skin rash that went away after a few use of the soap.</li>
            <li> He has toenail fungus while I on the other hand has an itchy toe.</li>
            <li> I will buy again and am recommending to other people.</li>
            <li> will ask Amazon for a RTG  and credit for this  imitation.  </li>
            <li> Love the  product but hate the package.  </li>
            <li> Also has cut down on dryness.</li>
            <li> Consider this before you consider other things!</li>
            <li> MAY BE ITS NOT MADE FOR BLACK NAILS.</li>
            <li> has a slight menthol-like  aromatic  smell, but not that medicated smell  </li>
            <li> The only thing that it does have a bit of a weird smell to it such as medicinal.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my feet don&#x27;t itch like they did previously.</li>
            <li> When its hot and muggy I just use the soap and I have not had another breakout since.</li>
            <li> think it&#x27;s a little over priced</li>
            <li> Use everyday once a day or twice</li>
            <li> I will post an update after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Just my experience, and although I was firm, my doctor was informed and included and listened to.</li>
            <li> This product cleared it up in a few fays.</li>
            <li> you can feel this stuff working, stinks to high heaven, but works well</li>
            <li> I have faithfully used it twice a day on my feet as I have a couple nails that are in pretty bad shape.  </li>
            <li> It takes a few months but for me it worked!  </li>
            <li> I have tried all the usual over the counter brands</li>
            <li> I think this killed my ring worm!</li>
            <li> usually about every 3 weeks</li>
            <li> No more itchy skin.</li>
            <li> i had recurring jock itch for the past two years.  </li>
            <li> Anti Fungal has jet enough  product in to say its tea tree oil  ,,, the &amp;#34;medicated&amp;#34;  part of this soap is weak tea also !!~</li>
            <li> Much less expensive than the creams in the store and relieves all problems rather than just those areas that you know about.  </li>
            <li> l suspected l had a fungus especially in the groin area which smelled really bad , and on my foot which caused it to flake  literally.</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> Its not good for with tea tree oil cause Yeast</li>
            <li> Well, that made it worse.  </li>
            <li> l ordered this because as an active gym goer, l had started to smell really bad even though l showered.</li>
            <li> My father had a bad case of toenail fungus and there was little he could do in his day.  </li>
            <li> The product is a gel and is somewhat difficult to get out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> After fighting off a nasty case of cellulitis on my calf, I had difficulty getting my skin to heal completely due to flaking, so I purchased this soap to protect against any re-infection.</li>
            <li> I bought this in desperate need of something to cure athlete&#x27;s foot.  </li>
            <li> My husband had a crazy toe fungus that wouldn&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li> I had itched between my toes so badly that there were blisters.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t get sick of the scent.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed, try this product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff really works in conjunction with Pure Tree Oil!  I have tried over the counter anti fungal ointments to address ringworm that I got in the classroom.  That did not work.  Then I tried antifungal prescription pills.  That briefly cleared it up but it came right back after two prescription tries.  Then I read about this soap.  It takes time but worked for me.  I use a washcloth with it three times a day in the infected area which was on my arms.  Then I put the tea tree oil on that after drying the infected area. Gradually, I pulled back on the tea tree liquid oil to once a day and just stuck with the soap.  Now the antifungal soap is all I use and that will be gradually eliminated too.  It takes a few months but for me it worked!  I read about the studies in Australia and the tea tree oil seemed effective.  Plus, it wasn&#x27;t a prescription drug which appealed to me too.  There are different fungus types so it may not work for everyone.  For me it did!</li>
            <li> Fungal problems are anything but fun.  Ultimately it&#x27;s a situation that needs a remedy ASAP.  I developed a serious &amp;#34;rash&amp;#34; under both arms and figured a mild steroid (cortisone cream) might fix it.  Well, that made it worse.  The mild soap I always use made it worse.  Checked the medical websites and concluded it was likely a fungal issue.  Checked Amazon for a quality anti-fungal wash that I could use in conjunction with medicated powders I located.  Purely Northwest Anti-Fungal Foot &amp; Body Wash really helped alleviate the problem.  After my first shower with the product I got significant relief.  Within three days the issue resolved.  The wash contains a variety of natural oils that really calmed the irratated area.  And it has a fresh peppermint scent.  Of the two medicated anti-fungal powders I tried, one had miconazole, the other had calcium undecylenate.  My thanks to Purely Northwest.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> This  is a cheap  copy of  Funga Soap. Diluted!!  All these people did  was copy  Funga  Soap  which was/is  sold at CVS  then  diluted it!!  Buy the  CVS version,,  you&#x27;ll see  much better  results~!! I am  not  related  to any  body at Funga  Soap,  just used that for years!!  Its very good as I travel to tropical  Asia where fungus  is  rampant Funga Soap works real good on fungus !!  I  bought  this recently on Amazon,  very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I will ask Amazon for a RTG  and credit for this  imitation.  Anti Fungal has jet enough  product in to say its tea tree oil  ,,, the &amp;#34;medicated&amp;#34;  part of this soap is weak tea also !!~</li>
            <li> i like it better than a bar of soap.  I doubt there&#x27;s any therapeutic value.</li>
            <li> it seems to help control a rash. although I am still looking for a topical cr&amp;egrave;me that will cure it. I have tried all the usual over the counter brands</li>
            <li> I am using this product for contact dermititis on my hands, it&#x27;s helping control the itch!</li>
            <li> Amazing product made my skin calm and smooth</li>
            <li> This product is great! After 2 weeks of using it, the bottom of my feet have stopped peeling and is noticeably smoother. I personally think you will still have to use some sort of antifungal spray or powder, etc..to completely get rid of athletes feet, but this is a great start, and much more proven than regular soap. For best results use a brush, it will sooth your feet and you won&#x27;t use as much. Five stars for my money!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my friend who has tried everything for his athletes foot with little success. This product has given the best results. His feet are showing definite signs of improvement and the fact that he can use it while showering makes daily treatment easy.  We will definitely keep using this product ! Will upgrade to 5 stars when feet are clear.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t create a lot of bubbles but still does the job. I also add tea tree oil to my bath.</li>
            <li> This product is great  It will help you get rid of fungal infections on the skin. I was practically cleared up in 2 weeks.  Use everyday once a day or twice and you will see results I also combine with tea tree oil and selsun blue apply in shower for 5 minutes or more. And rinse.  I&#x27;m so happy this product is amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT DID NOT WORK FOR ME. INFACT IT AGGRAVATED MY NAIL CONDITION. MAY BE ITS NOT MADE FOR BLACK NAILS.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good can make you feel good n smell  good</li>
            <li> We will try it and see how it works.</li>
            <li> Love the product, works well.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very soothing, calming, and refreshing for me; I suffered an allergic reaction to insect bites, and this was recommended by my dermatologist, as fungal infections may result from scratching; the tea tree oil smell is very deep, meaning I know it&#x27;s genuine. My skin feels so clean after use; for me, this is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Product is great. Thanks for the great customer service.</li>
            <li> Works really well.  Excellent cutomer service.  Would highly recommend soap &amp; Purely Northwest.</li>
            <li> This soap is great. I bought it because I had ringworm that just would not go away with the lotions and pills the dermatologist prescribed. I ordered this wash, and perhaps the combination of lotions and the wash cleared up my ringworm! It also helped rid me of stubborn acne on my back. I love using this stuff, and ill definitely buy another bottle in the future.</li>
            <li> very good product cleans very well reduce my scars on my legs I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> Arrived very fast and in excellent packaging.  Like to dilute this product with another shampoo as it is very effective for my needs.  Excellent Product.  Thank-you so much.  Great Seller!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I have problem feet, and am constantly battling athlete&#x27;s foot, rough dry skin, itching, etc.  I saw a difference after the first use, and now my feet look and feel so much better (I now use it every other day in the shower with a foot scrub brush).  I love this so much, I took it on vacation with me!  I highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li> Nice smell, great sudsing action. I use it with a foot scrubber for my sandal-feet.</li>
            <li> This soap does help fight jock itch. Just keep in mind that it won&#x27;t replace anti fungal topical since it helps with the symptoms of jock itch. I recommended using towel rags to increase the damage on affected area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far in my experience with this soap is reasonable. I wasn&#x27;t getting much results until the 7th day. I use this twice a day, day and night with topical. What I realize during the middle of the week that it&#x27;s very effective with a wash cloth, it&#x27;s the lather that makes a difference. Then I started knowing the results 5th - 7th day. I&#x27;ll continue to use this product, and I will be purchasing this product again!</li>
            <li> The soap didn&#x27;t help me with my perspiration, and I still have embarrassing foot odor.</li>
            <li> have not used enough to know for sure yet</li>
            <li> Really gentle on sensitive or irritated skin. Works very well. It smells great too.</li>
            <li> I love this soap and would recommend it for your skin needs.</li>
            <li> I have some serious skin issues and am hypersensitive to many fungi on this planet! I was looking for a soothing, nicely scented, gentle and cleansing body wash that would also benefit my skin while I go through a completion of other various treatments for Lyme disease and skin disorders. I found this small business online, and I would not have it any differently! Their quality and labeling assured me that I was buying the right product, without spending oodles of money doing it. I love the feeling I get from the tea tree and menthol and I don&#x27;t get sick of the scent. I would recommend Purely Northwest products to anyone looking for a better quality and not overwhelming body wash/product experience. Every time I take a shower it is something I look forward to in my day to know that I am going to feel clean, fresh, and like my skin finally found something useful to it&#x27;s issues. I love this Anti-fungal soap! :-) GREAT JOB!</li>
            <li> Some of the best wash I have every bought</li>
            <li> Love this antifungal soap.  It has a very nice scent--the tea tree is very subtle and dissipates quickly.  I like it very much.  I have been using a different product, but like this one much more.  I am a massage therapist and am always concerned with potentially picking up a fungus or skin irritation from clients (depite how meticulous I am with hand and arm washing) and have more peace of mind in using this product.</li>
            <li> This smells like eucalyptus had a baby with mint.  I used this wash along with a doctor prescribed topical ointment to treat a fungus on my leg.  The wash helped clean and calm my irritated fungal infection from the very first wash, and helped me feel less icky --due to having a fungal infection on my leg.  The product arrived in a timely fashion.  The company seems to stand by their product and really care about what the consumers think.  As far as I am concerned, this is a great product that I plan to use as my regular soap (hoping to prevent future fungal infections).  Definitely recommend this product to those with irritated itchy skin.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell , this is quite effective.  And the smell is very pleasant.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Customer service is incredible. 10/10 would wash again.</li>
            <li> Concentrated, works well. Got this originally for athletes foot. Now I am using as body wash.</li>
            <li> The fungal wash is okay</li>
            <li> This wonderful for break outs !</li>
            <li> My condition is not as bad as some, but this soap helps with the dry cracking skin for sure. Only been a couple weeks and so far I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Not exactly the kind of thing you want to publicly admit to buying or using, much less reviewing, but it really worked for me. I got toe fungus from a nail salon and I wasn&#x27;t getting any results from other products.  It has a good clean smell and feels refreshing on skin. I use it 2x day on my feet. Kind of wish I had taken before/after pics to show, but foot pics are a bit of an overshare. Bottom line: My toes are 80% better in a week of use. Pleasantly surprised. I can barely tell there is an issue now, when only a week before use my toenails were covered in blotchy white marks and were yellowing.</li>
            <li> Fastest that I&#x27;ve ever received a product. Only been using product a week but it does seems to be helping.</li>
            <li> Very Very good product. I use it in conjunction w/over the Lamisil cream &amp;its outstanding.</li>
            <li> Works as intented.  Didn&#x27;t really have a foot issue before, or at least I didn&#x27;t think I did but after using this my feet feel amazing.</li>
            <li> smells good not strong, does help keep feet skin soft.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I use it as a gave and body wash and it really helps get you clean.  has a great lather and great tea tree smell ( if you like tea tree) -  has a slight menthol-like  aromatic  smell, but not that medicated smell  that ruins the appeal of good products.  it works really well, especially for me, I have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t do harsh products.</li>
            <li> This Soap works Great.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to other.&lt;br /&gt;Helped clear my skin in one week after I started using the soap.</li>
            <li> I use this soap every morning when I shower as I believe that it is an excellent antifungal regime.</li>
            <li> After fighting off a nasty case of cellulitis on my calf, I had difficulty getting my skin to heal completely due to flaking, so I purchased this soap to protect against any re-infection. This product left a burning sensation on new skin. This was not an open wound. Used elsewhere there were no problems.  As received, the cap was on snugly but the seal was loose under the cap. Not good. The product is a gel and is somewhat difficult to get out of the bottle. If you can invert the bottle so the gel is always on the cap, this helps. Strong odor, somewhat overpowering for a morning shower but it does lather well and rinse off completely. I will not buy again.  2 months later - I really tried to use it but got fed up with getting the gel out of the bottle and the powerful odor. I eventually dumped it out. WHatever the positive medicinal qualities, it&#x27;s not worth the hastle.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought your product for my girlfriend and she love her fungal infection went away after a week of using it and she loves how smooth her skin was in her words</li>
            <li> Just received this product three days ago and started using immediately. It&#x27;s already working for my Tinea Versicolor! So happy to have finally found a product that works. I will most definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Very fresh scent and clean feeling!</li>
            <li> I had some athlete&#x27;s foot from the gym and I couldn&#x27;t get rid of it with the product I normally use. I picked this up and switched the OTC anti-fungal I was using and knocked it out fast. It smells good and I will definitely keep it around for precautionary washes after the gym. The only downside is that I prefer a bar of soap, so I am hoping they eventually put that out to market.</li>
            <li> product smells good and leaves u clean. It helps if you have smelly under arms and using natural deodorants, especially during the summer. Wish it was a bigger bottle. Been using this for about a month now and I love it. Just it can get kinda pricey if you use this on the daily</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  Works fast to get rid of skin ickies, smells fresh, and you don&#x27;t have to use much at a time.  DEFINITELY RECOMMEND.  As far as the vendor, I could not be more pleased.  You can purchase with no worries at all.</li>
            <li> I use this to to wash my face and whole body. I use it with my body wash and another face wash every day and it&#x27;s done wonders for my skin. I don&#x27;t mind the smell, I actually kind of like it. I&#x27;m buying more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I bought this in desperate need of something to cure athlete&#x27;s foot.  I had itched between my toes so badly that there were blisters.  The Tinactin and Clometrizole wasn&#x27;t working.  I ordered this along with Tea Tree oil (I had ran out!) and Miconazole.  The reviews on this were good and it was a best seller, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I started by washing my foot 3 x / day and I can tell you this stuff works!  I rotated tea tree oil (diluted) and Miconazole, but I tested this out by skipping and just doing Miconazole and the itch came back!  I am still using this as well as diluted tea tree oil to attack the toe nail fungus I&#x27;ve had on the same foot for 4 years in 3 nails and it seems to be working.  I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING, too.  This is a great product, great price and nice fast shipping, too.  Consider this before you consider other things!</li>
            <li> I am giving this product 4 stars, although it did not work for me.  My doctor had to prescribe a stronger medication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company followed through on their money back guarantee though and that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving 4 stars!!! Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Great product. Very refreshing. Wonderful prompt service from Purely Northwest.</li>
            <li> Maybe I have go use it more often, but I&#x27;m not sure what is suppose to happen to my feet after using but nothing happened.</li>
            <li> I got this for jock itch primarily, which I think has helped, but not entirely sure. I think it&#x27;s a good product, and I am sure works well, and overall, I think it does, but not sure if it is this soap or also in combination of the other things I am using.</li>
            <li> I love this wash. It works well and smells great.</li>
            <li> I love stuff, takes care of all of my skin problems including itch.</li>
            <li> I like how it works. It makes your feet feel refreshed and makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li> No difference seen since using this product on my dogs red yeast from tears.</li>
            <li> So glad I found this product.  I live in a hot and humid climate, and after a long day in the heat I sometimes get a little irritated in the crease under my tummy. This antifungal soap has eliminated the problem and I&#x27;m so much more comfortable, now. I recommend it without reservation.</li>
            <li> This soap has helped me treating my ringworm. Amazing!</li>
            <li> It has a strong smell of tea tree. My husband likes it for his skin. I use if I have a rash and it imedistely stops the itch.</li>
            <li> Great product. Pleasant smell and worked well.</li>
            <li> This product is incredible. Been using it for over a week, nearly every day, and my athletes foot is gone. My toe fungus is clearing up a bit. I&#x27;ve also used this as a face wash every so often, as tea tree oil is a great natural serum for your skin and for acne. Natural, essential oils are the way to go. You don&#x27;t need chemicals to treat everything! This product proves that.</li>
            <li> Love the wash!  Will buy again</li>
            <li> I like the smell. It seems to be effective, but I won&#x27;t know until I use it for a few months. Foams easily.</li>
            <li> It really works great!</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Works instantly and leaves your feet feeling clean. This product is the truth.</li>
            <li> IT WORKS!  My father had a bad case of toenail fungus and there was little he could do in his day.  I have had a problem with one small toe and big toe for years and as I aged I found I needed a floor foot scrubber to properly wash my feet without bending over in the shower.  Fortunately, I spotted your antifungal soap and used both products as part of my daily routine.  Improvement could be seen by the end of the first week of use and I am very pleased.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Works Good. I feel cleaner</li>
            <li> Really helps my skin feel clean without drying.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Thank you, Purely Northwest for checking in on me. The Antifungal Soap has worked great! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I did not believe this was going work but now I am a believer !</li>
            <li> I just started using it and I do feel some progress in some symptoms. It is true you have to use a  sponge because the product only frothed when used with them</li>
            <li> Great for curing and keeping athlete&#x27;s foot and jock itch at bay. Smells great and leaves skin fresh, clean, cool and tingly.</li>
            <li> Its not good for with tea tree oil cause Yeast thats  big problem .. need other differnt kind of that not with Tea Tree oil cause yeast and health effect!</li>
            <li> you can feel this stuff working, stinks to high heaven, but works well</li>
            <li> Your antifungal soap is amazing. Over the years I have used prescription creams that didn&#x27;t work as well as your soap has, thank you I&#x27;ll keep using it because it makes my skin feel great.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great value</li>
            <li> My wife and I play tennis every day, and after developing and underarm fungus, I decided to look into ointments and washes. I used an antifungal ointment that seemed to clear it up a little, but I decided to buy this wash to kill the fungus faster. It smells great and stops the itching really well. My underarm is healing nicely. The staff is also very attentive and they seem like they really care about their customers. I plan to keep this around to prevent further fungus in the future.</li>
            <li> wonderful for reducing genital itching.</li>
            <li> Its probably too early to tell but it appears to be doing its thing. I will post an update after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Very soothing and is relieving my itch due to fungus.</li>
            <li> fast-easy-does the job right every time,,,clear&#x27;s up  reacruing skin problem fast -easy...will be back for more!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product a little goes a long way. If you have any problems with your skin or body odors this is the solution. My dry skin cleared up seemingly overnight and foot odors only took one use. You won&#x27;t be disappointed, try this product.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle.  I find it helps with itchy &amp;#34;summer&amp;#34; skin.  Very soothing to irritated areas where tight clothing chafes.  I would highly recommend that you try this!</li>
            <li> Great product, delivered on time</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s working... want to give a couple more weeks before I give a full report.  But it seems to be clearing up whatever I&#x27;ve been fighting on my feet for ages!</li>
            <li> Home Health Care Nurse applied it today to my feet and legs. I believe it will help but cannot go 5 stars yet.</li>
            <li> had some fungal infection on my back and shoulder. I COULD swear by this product, as I have used it to shower for the last week, and most of the fungus on my skin is GONE!!!!!!WOW..buy it</li>
            <li> Much less itchy right now, so I suppose it&#x27;s working good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even better, the seller contacted me through email to provide some tips and suggestions. This really makes me feel good. It seems I am not only buying the product, but I am also buying a set of service.</li>
            <li> Eh. it smelled good but not sure it was worth it.</li>
            <li> I am so far very pleased with the product. I chose to dilute it with pure filtered water and put it in a spray bottle. This was easier for me to handle and use in the shower for my particular condition.  I am recovering from a crazy case of cellulitis, and am unsure what might have started it--fungus is suspect but because there is no obvious wound or obvious fungal issue is also unconfirmed--have been on crazy antibiotics for over a month which create their own issues especially in warm creases when you are asked to always sit with your leg elevated and need to be careful with compromised skin. Antibiotics alone didn&#x27;t do it for me. 4 ER visits and three hospital admissions later I decided to inform my doctor exactly what I would be doing at home. Gave them a chance to observe me with these treatments in the hospital, and advocated for what I know about my own body.  I read reviews on many products and also checked ingredient lists.  I chose this product for natural ingredients and reviews that addressed actual fungal issues that were helped, rather than the smell or how good skin feels.  I like natural, organic ingredients as I am allergic to many things artificial and pharmaceutical- which was part of my problem with even the most gentle standard hospital treatments.  Some of the most noticeable improvement for me has been on the back of one very expensive bio-available drug, lots of lyposomal vitamin C, probiotics, digestive enzymes, diluted apple cider vinegar rinses, showers with this product, and tea tree oil/vitamin E carefully applied directly to dry skin. Then large ace bandage wraps for swelling and to protect the compromised skin. Just my experience, and although I was firm, my doctor was informed and included and listened to. I have some wonderful nurse friends and work with a medical assistant/ massage therapy department at work. Best of both worlds for this nasty stubborn infection.  Respect your medical professionals, but if it isn&#x27;t working, it isn&#x27;t working.  Customer service is prompt and superb too.</li>
            <li> Got to say this item does help with most fungus problems such as athletes feet and jock itch. The only thing that it does have a bit of a weird smell to it such as medicinal. Wish it had some form of Axe or Old Spice scent into it but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I like the product it works well all the itching is gone.</li>
            <li> Husband loves it, he uses it as a regular body wash and he says it leaves him feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> Great product. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I think this killed my ring worm!</li>
            <li> I am going to order more of this product as I really like it. Thanks</li>
            <li> Gave this to my son........word from him .....it is his new shower soap. Get used to tea tree smell and it helps clear a lot of skin issues. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> My husband had a crazy toe fungus that wouldn&#x27;t go away. He has been using it for a week now and i don&#x27;t remember the last time I saw his feet look better.</li>
            <li> Works great and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I love the blend of scents but not sure how much it helped with a fungal outbreak</li>
            <li> We have to wear closed shoes at work, even in summer. I bought this product because I developed a small red itchy patch on my foot. This product cleared it up in a few fays.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the product!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I started using it on my feet for a reoccurring case of athlete&#x27;s foot on one foot and it instantly cleared it up without having to use additional medication. It smells great and leaves my feet and toe nails looking and feeling fresh and clean!  At the suggestion of another reviewer, I also use it weekly to wash my under arms and it completely removes any funk left behind from the daily use of deodorant that sometimes doesn&#x27;t smell so fresh.  This literally &amp;#34;cleans the slate&amp;#34; so your under arm can smell new each time.  It was nice receiving a follow up email from the seller however, they should consider giving the buyer a few days to actually use the product to be able to give feedback.</li>
            <li> love it! super gentle and just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> what I really appreciated was how quick they were to get this product to me. I needed it right away, did not mention that but I think I got it within 16 hours! thank YOU! and what a pleasant adjunct to my treatments.</li>
            <li> I am a skeptic at heart, so I wanted to wait for a couple months to review. I have been plagued by fungus type rashes my entire life. It comes and goes, but usually about every 3 weeks I have a flair up. I have a drawer full of prescription medicines and cremes  that don&#x27;t work, or only marginally work, so I thought I would give this a try based on reviews.  After close to 3 months of using the product and no other changes in lifestyle, I have had very few problems with rashes. When they start to flair, I use a little extra and leave it on for a longer of period of time, and it seems to take care of it.  Bottom line, this has so far worked better than any prescription medicine, which is surprising because I have found most natural products are ineffective. The only recomendation would be to make the dispenser hole slightly smaller so not as much product comes out.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my feet don&#x27;t itch like they did previously. I have been fighting fungus for years, and finally realized that except for a miracle, it is an ongoing battle. I get pin-point laser treatments on my toe nails once a month, plus wash my feet once or twice daily using a prescribed bleach scrub with a brush that I replace monthly, use foot spray inside my shoes daily prior to wearing, change my socks daily (sometimes twice a day), use a prescribed topical on and around my toe nails, add bleach to the water I wash my feet with......I could go on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The point is, this is something I began using a couple weeks ago, and the difference this one product was made is noticeable.</li>
            <li> A very nice all natural product.</li>
            <li> One of the best I&#x27;ve used and at a good price. Has worked great with my sensitive skin and love the smell.</li>
            <li> I am using this soap for itchy hands and feet not related to fungus or bacteria. Doctors do not know what it is...at any rate this stuff is great! I get hours of real relief. Great for a scrub after a nice, long foot soak. I like it as a general body wash too.  Lasts a long time...will buy again.</li>
            <li> Pleasant, light scent.</li>
            <li> Product works well, I am very pleased with this product and Purely Northwest&#x27;s customer focus.</li>
            <li> it smells a little weird, the only reason for four star, but it works fine after a weeks use. It leaves your skin dry right after u toilet down and last long enough for additional items u wish to use.</li>
            <li> Product as good as advertised!</li>
            <li> Love the  product but hate the package.  It is not a squeeze bottle so it take a lot of effort to get the wash out.</li>
            <li> This soap has been great to help with the skin fungus that I thought I had as well as itchy, dry feet, and some other issues.  My son is also using it to help with his college showers.  Much less expensive than the creams in the store and relieves all problems rather than just those areas that you know about.  Highly recommended for all!</li>
            <li> Great product! Healed  my cracking and peeling.</li>
            <li> I love this wash, but the bottle is very hard to squeeze.</li>
            <li> Was helpful to clear up fungus or just get a cleaner feeling. Don&#x27;t over use as the tea tree will dry you out.</li>
            <li> Within 3 days of using this product, my persistent foot itch went away, as did any lingering odor. Now I just use it once a day in the shower to keep it up. However, it hasn&#x27;t completely taken away the dry skin on parts of my foot... But I have only been using it a few weeks. (And to be fair, I took a few days off last week because of vacation). So I totally recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My husband says he loves this soap and so far, it&#x27;s working. I changed the top to a small pump because it&#x27;s much easier to use that way, but the product is great.</li>
            <li> I think this works against funguses. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> l have been waiting for 30 days to write a review as l wanted to write a review based on observations l had while using it over a long period of time. l ordered this because as an active gym goer, l had started to smell really bad even though l showered. l suspected l had a fungus especially in the groin area which smelled really bad , and on my foot which caused it to flake  literally. l had tried going to the doctor and they gave me prescription medicine which did not work, but l felt excarberated the smell. l ordered this and the smell literally went down to a point where l could not smell anything unless l really tried and my foot is so clear of the fungus. l used this as a whole body wash, l literally know use everyday because it leaves feeling fresh.

            <li> I bought this to help my boys not get anything while playing football!  We are using it as a preventative.  It has a strong medicinal smell-but it does not linger long.</li>
            <li> Item is great and customer service is even better</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product !!  I saw major difference after first time use .  Do you have shampoo product ?  Or can I use  this in my hair ?</li>
            <li> Great Fungus wash, leaves your skin feeling clean and silky smooth, granted it isn&#x27;t the best smelling soap, but it&#x27;s natural and leaves your skin feeling great and clean and eliminates fungus you might have on your skin or take a proactive approach to protecting your skin. I&#x27;d buy a couple bottles at a time since bottle isn&#x27;t that big and if you shower everyday, it could be done in a month or sooner depending on how many showers you take. it is also great to wash your feet with after wearing shoes the whole day and you want to take a proactive approach of keeping fungus from invading your skin or nails.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I smells amazing, its made me generally less gross. My horrible sports bra rash is gone. Yes!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I think I have found exactly what works for me.  I have faithfully used it twice a day on my feet as I have a couple nails that are in pretty bad shape.  Believe it or not, it appears to be working quite well.</li>
            <li> I started using the aunt fungal body wash right as soon as I received it. First day of use was already amazing! No more itchy skin. I had this long time skin rash that went away after a few use of the soap. It&#x27;s got a refreshing...long lasting good smell...it gives you that feeling of you skip a bath or a shower.</li>
            <li> Good stuff! It instantly cools the infected area and makes it feel better.</li>
            <li> Good product and it worked to clear up white blotches on my skin that were caused by a fungus. Just in time to show some skin in summer!</li>
            <li> Love this product! I developed a fungal infection on both legs due to the antibiotics I was taking. This takes away the pain and the heat off my shins. I cannot believe how fast it works. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product! Keeps my feet fresh and dry in sandals. Also has cut down on dryness. I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Been using this for over a month and have not seen any improvements at all. Smells nice though.</li>
            <li> very happy with the product and the service thanks.</li>
            <li> My husband and I are using this and we both like it!! He has toenail fungus while I on the other hand has an itchy toe. I was sleepless 3 nights ago due to my very itchy toe. I did my research and found this amazing product. As soon as I received the item I used it right away. Only after 3 days of using it, the itchiness is gone!!! SO AMAZING!</li>
            <li> This is good soap and has plenty of tea tree oil in it. It smells great and you can use it freely on your entire body.&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s a little over priced and I wish it had a little better lather. But other than that I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff, cleared up a case of athlete&#x27;s foot in a few days.  Actually smells pretty good and leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the tip to use this product with a nail brush. It&#x27;s more effective with a brush and helps conserve the product. I&#x27;m using multiple treatments, but this does seem to help!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take long for the soap to help relieve irritated, reddened skin and is quite soothing. Leaves your skin feeling smooth and fresh as well while smelling quite nice. I definitely recommend it to anyone who either has issues with fungus or irritated skin.</li>
            <li> i had recurring jock itch for the past two years.  never had jock itch or athletes foot before in my life, but I couldn&#x27;t get rid of it.  I used all the over the counter chemical products such as Lamisil and they would help clear it up over a period of time but it kept coming back.  I decided to take a different course of action and got this Tea Tree soap and also  Aloe Vesta Antifungal Ointment.  I would wash my groin area twice a day with this product and then completely dry the are (I used a hair dryer much to the chagrin of my GF) and then apply the Aloe Vesta ointment.  Overall the products seemed much more natural than the brand name chemical creams but best of all IT WORKED. After about three weeks I was completely clear.  When its hot and muggy I just use the soap and I have not had another breakout since.</li>
            <li> When I first got this I was expecting it to be bigger, but after using it ad seeing the quality of the product I absolutely think it is worth it, ive only just started using it so i cant say now if it will help, but it sure feels amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the way it makes my skin feel and the smell is hard to describe, like it wakes my skin up, and i feel so clean and good afterwords!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;using it in combination with an antifungal cream, so far seems to be working well, at the very least its a great body wash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been fighting athlete&#x27;s foot for years and I&#x27;m already seeing a great imporvement in just a few days of using this.  I&#x27;ve used straight Tea Tree Oil in the past, but the smell is so strong that I can&#x27;t take my shoes off without being overpowered.  The Antifungal Soap is the perfect blend of effectiveness and less scent.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  It takes care of athlete&#x27;s foot for certain.  I am not yet sure about toenail fungus, but I think it works on that too.  I love the way it smells and I really appreciate the company&#x27;s direct communication to be sure I am a satisfied customer.  I will buy again and am recommending to other people.</li>
