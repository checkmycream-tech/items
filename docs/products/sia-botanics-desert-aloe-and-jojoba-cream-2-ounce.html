            <li>I love the fact that there is no fragrance</li>

            <li>I wanted a night cream that would help keep my skin hydrated and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I always think it&#x27;s going to have an oily feel because it goes on so smoothly</li>
            <li>I found the cream very hydrating, as I have tried lots of creams with having dry skin, and this one does what it says, excellent delivery.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful, deep moisturizer for mature skin.</li>
            <li>I love this so much that I&#x27;m thinking about switching all of my skin care products over to this brand.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s super moisturizing.</li>

            <li>Since I&#x27;ve used Sia Botanics products, I&#x27;ve had many compliments on my skin which I attribute completely to these products.</li>
            <li>Will try other products as I believe this company makes good quality skin care.</li>
            <li>Perhaps the aloe and jojoba line of products is not the right one for my skin.</li>
            <li>As soon as it&#x27;s dry my face feels so nice but not oily or greasy at all.</li>
            <li>The cream sinks in nicely into your skin</li>
            <li>After first use my skin felt silky</li>
            <li>First, I would like to start off by saying I bought this lotion because it was recommended to me by a trusted friend.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t notice any real improvement to my skin and went back to what I normally use most often.</li>
            <li>I have tried quite a bit of products and this really works for me.</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>my skin feels butter smooth once I apply this and also get a tingling sensation every time I apply this around my dry areas around my cheeks</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>and it is gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My face was so try from the harsh winter we just had in the Northeast within 3 days of using this product, my forehead broke out, not horribly</li>
            <li>I have dry skin with patches, but with the right amount of exfoliation and this lotion I do not anymore!</li>
            <li>This never happens when I try a new product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is quite greasy on my face (maybe because I don&#x27;t have super dry skin?).</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t used it enough to determine whether I could have given it a higher rating.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and was on the hunt for a new night cream.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a week and have been very pleased; I now have a few other Sia products on my list of things to try</li>
            <li>But I do like it so far.</li>
            <li>I appreciate the quality of the products and all of the natural ingredients that go into them.</li>
            <li>Thus far, I like it</li>
            <li>This one was ranked the best and it was the least expensive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m disappointed because I really like that it doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent, and the packaging was nicely done.</li>
            <li>Though I am not one who generally submits reviews, I hope that with enough positive feedback this company will be around for a long time!</li>
            <li>I am a 55 year old women who has been using Sia Botanics products for several years now.</li>
            <li>Very soothing helps with extreme dry skin.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I read some great reviews for this product and was excited to try it. My face was so try from the harsh winter we just had in the Northeast within 3 days of using this product, my forehead broke out, not horribly and it may not be noticeable from a distance, but I definitely notice it when I look into the mirror. I&#x27;m disappointed because I really like that it doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent, and the packaging was nicely done. Perhaps the aloe and jojoba line of products is not the right one for my skin.</li>
            <li> The cream sinks in nicely into your skin and you feel it hydrates and nourishes the skin. Will try other products as I believe this company makes good quality skin care.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little greasy and doesn&#x27;t have the best smell, but it&#x27;s super moisturizing!</li>
            <li> A little oiler than I had hoped, but works well in the desert climate where I live.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best night cream perfect for the dryness skin and good price .I only gave it 4 star because my skin feels oily/greasy but it&#x27;s super moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This cream is perfect for my skin.  After i wash my face i put this on before i sleep.  It does go on a little greasy but nothing too bothersome.  When i wake up, my skin feels like a baby&#x27;s smooth cheek.  No lie!  I have tried quite a bit of products and this really works for me.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a GOOD night cream. Well, I landed on Total Beauty website, entered my search query, &amp;#34;best night cream&amp;#34; and the list of products and their price and ratings came up. This one was ranked the best and it was the least expensive. So, I ordered it. I figured for the money, I couldn&#x27;t go wrong. Well, it has turned out to be the BEST night cream I have every used!! I am 58 and people find it hard to guess my age because of care I give my skin. This product really works.</li>
            <li> Found this line while visiting family in Tucson and it is SUPER! YUM! No nasty ingredients and feels amazing on my skin. I&#x27;ve tried most of the line and love this, the pumpkin cream and the eye serum the best. Def giving the MyChelle line a run for its money. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Very soothing helps with extreme dry skin. Drys quickly doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling greasy- I will be buying this again</li>
            <li> Great night moisturizer. Doesn&#x27;t leave grease on my pillow and wake up with softer skin. I like it a lot!</li>
            <li> I have problematic skin...oily with occasional blackheads.  I wanted a night cream that would help keep my skin hydrated and smooth.  I like the feel of the cream....smooth and goes on easy.  And yes, this little jar will probably last awhile.  I only gave it  4 star because it is too soon to see any results so I don&#x27;t know how good it is working yet.  But I do like it so far.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It goes on really easily so it doesn&#x27;t take much. I always think it&#x27;s going to have an oily feel because it goes on so smoothly but it doesn&#x27;t. As soon as it&#x27;s dry my face feels so nice but not oily or greasy at all. I love this so much that I&#x27;m thinking about switching all of my skin care products over to this brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I am going to like this cream or not because I just received it today, The reason for the one star is that the seal was broken and I received 1/2 of a jar of cream. What a mess it was and shame on the seller for sending this out like that.</li>
            <li> I found the cream very hydrating, as I have tried lots of creams with having dry skin, and this one does what it says, excellent delivery.</li>
            <li> This cream is wonderful. I use it mostly as a night cream. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now, I&#x27;ve had no break outs and it keeps my face moisturized in Arizona&#x27;s dry weather.</li>
            <li> Bought this night cream because my skin is really dry. After first use my skin felt silky smooth!Now I couldn&#x27;t imagine not using this cream.Plus by buying the cream on Amazon I saved $5.00 and got the cream in two days, gotta love Prime!</li>
            <li> I am a 55 year old women who has been using Sia Botanics products for several years now. This is a wonderful, deep moisturizer for mature skin. A little bit goes a long way. It&#x27;s perfect for the dryness of the AZ desert and kept my skin radiant in Hawaii after too much sun exposure. Since I&#x27;ve used Sia Botanics products, I&#x27;ve had many compliments on my skin which I attribute completely to these products. I appreciate the quality of the products and all of the natural ingredients that go into them. I have never used skin care products that make my skin feel so \\&quot;happy\\&quot;. Though I am not one who generally submits reviews, I hope that with enough positive feedback this company will be around for a long time!</li>
            <li> Thus far, I like it but I haven&#x27;t used it enough to determine whether I could have given it a higher rating.</li>
            <li> First, I would like to start off by saying I bought this lotion because it was recommended to me by a trusted friend. I decided to buy this lotion because of the decently low price. I am so happy I made that choice and this now has become my night lotion and once a week I wear it during the day underneath my makeup! I have dry skin with patches, but with the right amount of exfoliation and this lotion I do not anymore! I always get compliments on my skin now and I give a lot of the credit to Sia Botanics Desert Aloe and Jojoba Cream. I even use this lotion on my entire body once in a while. My only request would be that this lotion should come in a larger container!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any real improvement to my skin and went back to what I normally use most often. Nice that it is so pure...</li>
            <li> Good lotion but a bit oiley</li>
            <li> Left my skin feeling oily.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that there is no fragrance and it is gentle on my sensitive skin. No break outs from this product.</li>
            <li> I have only used this twice but notice a difference in my skin already.  It leaves the skin so plump and moist, just as a night cream should (and most do not).  It is the best I have used.</li>
            <li> lovely and no problems so far! I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and was on the hunt for a new night cream. I found the review of another Sia product on Total Beauty but decided to go with this one. I have been using it for a week and have been very pleased; I now have a few other Sia products on my list of things to try soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO breakouts! NONE! I am flabbergasted. This never happens when I try a new product.&lt;br /&gt;My skin definitely looks and feels healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is quite greasy on my face (maybe because I don&#x27;t have super dry skin?). Since I&#x27;m only using it at night it is no big deal, but it took some getting used to.</li>
            <li> my skin feels butter smooth once I apply this and also get a tingling sensation every time I apply this around my dry areas around my cheeks, i believe thats the product working. Read good reviews on it before purchasing and I am happy with it.</li>
