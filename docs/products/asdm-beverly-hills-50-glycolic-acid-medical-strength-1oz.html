            <li>It is very strong.  </li>
            <li>This is, by far, the BEST glycolic acid peel for the amount paid.</li>
            <li>This product is too strong to be sold to non-professionals!</li>
            <li>Great product and service, thanks!</li>
            <li>I love this peel is great gentle but effective on the skin.</li>
            <li>If you have not used a peel before, make sure to follow the directions closely.</li>
            <li>couldnt be better</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still trying to figure out what I wanted this stuff for but glad to have it  - just in case</li>
            <li>It will take more than ten peels for this to make my skin somewhat flawless.</li>
            <li>There are so many wicked things from chem trails and GMO foods and</li>
            <li>I have dabbled in glycolics for years, but my favorite guinea pig is myself.</li>
            <li>I use Baby Magic.</li>
            <li>well, looking better all the time. :)</li>
            <li>Will continue with 1 week regime because my skin is looking noticeably better.</li>
            <li>Hoping after more applications to reduce both.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;(See, no wrinkles)  : ))</li>
            <li>Nothing more</li>
            <li>a similar treatment at a dermatologist&#x27;s office&lt;br /&gt;will cost a minimum of $40, so it is an excellent alternative to a treatment, just be sure to follow the time limits</li>
            <li>I decided to try ASDM Beverly Hills 50% and was pleased with results.</li>
            <li>Highly satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I am so excited I have finally found truly excellent quality acid.</li>
            <li>Good to use at home, as good results as from the aesthetician, just don&#x27;t leave on to long or you will burn  your skin.  </li>
            <li>This is really nice for refining pores and giving a fresh look.</li>
            <li>This is strong and works.</li>
            <li>Extremely strong.  </li>
            <li>This product turned out to be too strong and according to the instructions, would burn the skin.  </li>
            <li>Too strong for my face.</li>
            <li>Keeps my blackheads practically NON existent and give my skin a constant, beautiful glow.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel so smooth.</li>
            <li>Hopefully everything will go smoothly.</li>
            <li>2 pregnancies, As at now, my skin is as smooth as  a baby.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m seeing good results so far..</li>
            <li>This product does as it promise,s, it is as good as a professional peel.i</li>
            <li>So far so good, have used it twice already</li>
            <li>Not too strong, not too mild for me.</li>
            <li>This product is NOT buffered, which means it&#x27;s at the original</li>
            <li>Loaded bag balm on my face, took some aspirin and redness and stinging reduced significantly.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to do peels at home, for the love of all that&#x27;s holy, be careful and get some good instructions.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a different peel product for over a year and had great results,  until recently, evidently the company changed the formula and it no longer worked for me.  </li>
            <li>A good variation for regular peels.  </li>
            <li>If it works on 73 year old skin, think what it could do for yours!!  : )</li>
            <li>Just after the complete exfoliation that showed as good healthy younger skin.</li>
            <li>Mixed it with lotion and used that overnight about once a week and had amazing results.</li>
            <li>The intense itching made me reluctant to do multiple treatments although I had good results.</li>
            <li>those are sensitive for most people.</li>
            <li>(that&#x27;s just  a smile)</li>
            <li>Just as described and was fresh on arrival.</li>
            <li>I do right out of the shower, then I wash my arms and reapply when I get home from work.</li>
            <li>My face burned right away</li>
            <li>It is a slower process than I expected but great results thus far!!</li>
            <li>I used as directed on the box (not my first time getting a chemical peel, since they say don&#x27;t use if it&#x27;s your first time) and it caused bubbling, &amp;#34;frosting&amp;#34; (an esthetician term for whitening and peeling of the skin) and a mild skin burn on my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an experienced peeler, but I&#x27;ve bought buffered peels in the past.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is powerful, but not scary.</li>
            <li>LOVE it, my old acne scars have lightened so much.</li>
            <li>I have only used this item twice, so far so good.</li>
            <li>I am 40 years old with fine lines and a couple age spots.</li>
            <li>Love what this has done for my face... if you buy it follow the instructions and do not do extra time.  </li>
            <li>am however looking forward to my first attempt at a peel.</li>
            <li>I intentionally purchased a higher concentration in order to dilute to my tastes.</li>
            <li>I did my first peel with this vendor</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sitting here writing a review six hours  after my first application</li>
            <li>I personally use a fan brush to apply more evenly.</li>
            <li>I peel quite regularly, and I love this product.</li>
            <li>Im training in esthics, and find this product to be exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;and have a neutralizer available before you begin in the event that your skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li>When I first used the acid on a cotton ball</li>
            <li>but 4 days later after showering 6 times in a four day time frame and using the acid once more...</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it is suppose to.</li>
            <li>The seller was very professional, my order arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Was easy to use, made my skin baby smooth, glowing and evened out the dark spots.</li>
            <li>Be smart, it is your face.</li>
            <li>Mix it with pure water to get an easier application.</li>
            <li>and I expected better results by now.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t burn as much as people made it out to be, it tingled if anything.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>My skin really did not peel though??</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t burn as much as people made it out to be, it tingled if anything.</li>
            <li>It is real 50% unbuffered Glycolic Acid.</li>
            <li>If you are a beginner to doing your own &amp;#34;peels&amp;#34;, only leave on for 30 seconds to a minute initially.</li>
            <li>It not too strong where I cant go out in public for a while, but strong enough to do some peeling and is fading old scars and lightening age marks.</li>
            <li>Be sure to follow your &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; with a hyaluronic serum or collagen ampules or  other soothing serum.</li>
            <li>I have used this product, full strength to treat my Keratosis Pilarsis on my upper arms.</li>
            <li>Be careful as this is very strong and can burn your skin if not careful.</li>
            <li>This too, will disappear fairly quickly, and you&#x27;ll be left with no noticeable changes or improvement to your skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product five times and my face looks vibrant.</li>
            <li>I spent a nice day at the beach (i. e. touch of red glow).</li>
            <li>Need to be careful since it is strong and unbuffered.</li>
            <li>But then again I have a high tolerance for pain.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Professional Strength!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten professional chemical peels before and a couple years ago decided to stop spending so much money and do them myself.</li>
            <li>a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Had one professional glycolic peel (30%) for 5 minutes and didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is normal and part of the process.</li>
            <li>Left it on my face for two minutes and neutralized it right after.</li>
            <li>but I recommend diluting it it to make a 25% for those new to glycolic peels.</li>
            <li>The instructions on the box are very clear about application, neutralization, and removal.</li>
            <li>I left it on first for 8 minutes, then 10.</li>
            <li>The first three applications I left product on for 1 minute then followed with suggested baking soda neutralizer, then rinsed.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t want to get it too close to the corners of your mouth as that must be really sensitive, but once you get the hang of how to use it, I think you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li>First time I did not mix with a lotion and left on for about 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>There is a serious burning sensation while the product is on the skin, which actually intensifies for a minute when you neutralize it...and afterward for a short time your skin will look very very shiny– not in a good way, like you have a layer of clear nail polish on your face.</li>
            <li>This product is medical grade and too strong for the general public!</li>
            <li>I did have 8 huge sores emerge on my face on one side which previously had no acne</li>
            <li>I did noticed some peeling after second day, and little itching, after that I got better.</li>
            <li>clear it up</li>
            <li>have clear skin except for some sun spots which I wanted to go away.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve had no results at all from this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll go back to using retinA and wait until I can justify a real laser peel.</li>
            <li>No side effects so far</li>
            <li>I purchased this item after paying $150 plus tip for 3 professional acid peels and that was a discounted price.  </li>
            <li>I was up to 3 minutes with a 30% peel at the professional office</li>
            <li>Professional quality product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably too early to say.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a professional product use as directed.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my adult son to even out old acne scars.</li>
            <li>The first 24 hours my face stung, was red, had some red spots, and the corners of my nose were weepy.</li>
            <li>I got a little too aggressive around my frown lines and chin, and ended up with a mild burn.</li>
            <li>its ok not strong enough for mine personally</li>
            <li>Actually during the period I&#x27;ve used this my skin has markedly  worsened</li>
            <li>&amp; it barely tingles.</li>
            <li>Left my skin smooth/shiny and soft, yet looking like</li>
            <li>Professional aestheticians are only allowed to purchase 30% glycolic acid.</li>
            <li>My face turned all red which I think is natural.</li>
            <li>This is real acid so be careful!</li>
            <li>On day 2 and my face is sensitive, the red spots are still there and face is starting to peel.</li>
            <li>This product should ONLY be used under the supervision of a medical professional.</li>
            <li>I do experience a burning sensation and I do use a neutralizer baking soda and water solution right after, following with washing my face and and then using a toner and heavy moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>First application one layer and slight peeling, second application 2 to 3 layers required 1 week to heal.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had a chance to try my peel yet as I have a busy little  6 month old who keeps me</li>
    </ol>

            <li> a similar treatment at a dermatologist&#x27;s office&lt;br /&gt;will cost a minimum of $40, so it is an excellent alternative to a treatment, just be sure to follow the time limits</li>
            <li> I decided to try ASDM Beverly Hills 50% and was pleased with results.</li>
            <li> Highly satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I am so excited I have finally found truly excellent quality acid.</li>
            <li> Good to use at home, as good results as from the aesthetician, just don&#x27;t leave on to long or you will burn  your skin.  </li>
            <li> This is really nice for refining pores and giving a fresh look.</li>
            <li> This is strong and works.</li>
            <li> Extremely strong.  </li>
            <li> This product turned out to be too strong and according to the instructions, would burn the skin.  </li>
            <li> Too strong for my face.</li>
            <li> Keeps my blackheads practically NON existent and give my skin a constant, beautiful glow.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so smooth.</li>
            <li> Hopefully everything will go smoothly.</li>
            <li> 2 pregnancies, As at now, my skin is as smooth as  a baby.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m seeing good results so far..</li>
            <li> This product does as it promise,s, it is as good as a professional peel.i</li>
            <li> So far so good, have used it twice already</li>
            <li> Not too strong, not too mild for me.</li>
            <li> This product is NOT buffered, which means it&#x27;s at the original</li>
            <li> Loaded bag balm on my face, took some aspirin and redness and stinging reduced significantly.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to do peels at home, for the love of all that&#x27;s holy, be careful and get some good instructions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a different peel product for over a year and had great results,  until recently, evidently the company changed the formula and it no longer worked for me.  </li>
            <li> A good variation for regular peels.  </li>
            <li> If it works on 73 year old skin, think what it could do for yours!!  : )</li>
            <li> Just after the complete exfoliation that showed as good healthy younger skin.</li>
            <li> Mixed it with lotion and used that overnight about once a week and had amazing results.</li>
            <li> The intense itching made me reluctant to do multiple treatments although I had good results.</li>
            <li> those are sensitive for most people.</li>
            <li> (that&#x27;s just  a smile)</li>
            <li> Just as described and was fresh on arrival.</li>
            <li> I do right out of the shower, then I wash my arms and reapply when I get home from work.</li>
            <li> My face burned right away</li>
            <li> It is a slower process than I expected but great results thus far!!</li>
            <li> I used as directed on the box (not my first time getting a chemical peel, since they say don&#x27;t use if it&#x27;s your first time) and it caused bubbling, &amp;#34;frosting&amp;#34; (an esthetician term for whitening and peeling of the skin) and a mild skin burn on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an experienced peeler, but I&#x27;ve bought buffered peels in the past.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is powerful, but not scary.</li>
            <li> LOVE it, my old acne scars have lightened so much.</li>
            <li> I have only used this item twice, so far so good.</li>
            <li> I am 40 years old with fine lines and a couple age spots.</li>
            <li> Love what this has done for my face... if you buy it follow the instructions and do not do extra time.  </li>
            <li> am however looking forward to my first attempt at a peel.</li>
            <li> I intentionally purchased a higher concentration in order to dilute to my tastes.</li>
            <li> I did my first peel with this vendor</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sitting here writing a review six hours  after my first application</li>
            <li> I personally use a fan brush to apply more evenly.</li>
            <li> I peel quite regularly, and I love this product.</li>
            <li> Im training in esthics, and find this product to be exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;and have a neutralizer available before you begin in the event that your skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li> When I first used the acid on a cotton ball</li>
            <li> but 4 days later after showering 6 times in a four day time frame and using the acid once more...</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it is suppose to.</li>
            <li> The seller was very professional, my order arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Was easy to use, made my skin baby smooth, glowing and evened out the dark spots.</li>
            <li> Be smart, it is your face.</li>
            <li> Mix it with pure water to get an easier application.</li>
            <li> and I expected better results by now.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t burn as much as people made it out to be, it tingled if anything.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> My skin really did not peel though??</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t burn as much as people made it out to be, it tingled if anything.</li>
            <li> It is real 50% unbuffered Glycolic Acid.</li>
            <li> If you are a beginner to doing your own &amp;#34;peels&amp;#34;, only leave on for 30 seconds to a minute initially.</li>
            <li> It not too strong where I cant go out in public for a while, but strong enough to do some peeling and is fading old scars and lightening age marks.</li>
            <li> Be sure to follow your &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; with a hyaluronic serum or collagen ampules or  other soothing serum.</li>
            <li> I have used this product, full strength to treat my Keratosis Pilarsis on my upper arms.</li>
            <li> Be careful as this is very strong and can burn your skin if not careful.</li>
            <li> This too, will disappear fairly quickly, and you&#x27;ll be left with no noticeable changes or improvement to your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product five times and my face looks vibrant.</li>
            <li> I spent a nice day at the beach (i. e. touch of red glow).</li>
            <li> Need to be careful since it is strong and unbuffered.</li>
            <li> But then again I have a high tolerance for pain.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Professional Strength!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten professional chemical peels before and a couple years ago decided to stop spending so much money and do them myself.</li>
            <li> a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Had one professional glycolic peel (30%) for 5 minutes and didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is normal and part of the process.</li>
            <li> Left it on my face for two minutes and neutralized it right after.</li>
            <li> but I recommend diluting it it to make a 25% for those new to glycolic peels.</li>
            <li> The instructions on the box are very clear about application, neutralization, and removal.</li>
            <li> I left it on first for 8 minutes, then 10.</li>
            <li> The first three applications I left product on for 1 minute then followed with suggested baking soda neutralizer, then rinsed.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want to get it too close to the corners of your mouth as that must be really sensitive, but once you get the hang of how to use it, I think you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> First time I did not mix with a lotion and left on for about 4 minutes.</li>
            <li> There is a serious burning sensation while the product is on the skin, which actually intensifies for a minute when you neutralize it...and afterward for a short time your skin will look very very shiny– not in a good way, like you have a layer of clear nail polish on your face.</li>
            <li> This product is medical grade and too strong for the general public!</li>
            <li> I did have 8 huge sores emerge on my face on one side which previously had no acne</li>
            <li> I did noticed some peeling after second day, and little itching, after that I got better.</li>
            <li> clear it up</li>
            <li> have clear skin except for some sun spots which I wanted to go away.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve had no results at all from this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll go back to using retinA and wait until I can justify a real laser peel.</li>
            <li> No side effects so far</li>
            <li> I purchased this item after paying $150 plus tip for 3 professional acid peels and that was a discounted price.  </li>
            <li> I was up to 3 minutes with a 30% peel at the professional office</li>
            <li> Professional quality product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably too early to say.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a professional product use as directed.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my adult son to even out old acne scars.</li>
            <li> The first 24 hours my face stung, was red, had some red spots, and the corners of my nose were weepy.</li>
            <li> I got a little too aggressive around my frown lines and chin, and ended up with a mild burn.</li>
            <li> its ok not strong enough for mine personally</li>
            <li> Actually during the period I&#x27;ve used this my skin has markedly  worsened</li>
            <li> &amp; it barely tingles.</li>
            <li> Left my skin smooth/shiny and soft, yet looking like</li>
            <li> Professional aestheticians are only allowed to purchase 30% glycolic acid.</li>
            <li> My face turned all red which I think is natural.</li>
            <li> This is real acid so be careful!</li>
            <li> On day 2 and my face is sensitive, the red spots are still there and face is starting to peel.</li>
            <li> This product should ONLY be used under the supervision of a medical professional.</li>
            <li> I do experience a burning sensation and I do use a neutralizer baking soda and water solution right after, following with washing my face and and then using a toner and heavy moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> First application one layer and slight peeling, second application 2 to 3 layers required 1 week to heal.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had a chance to try my peel yet as I have a busy little  6 month old who keeps me</li>
            <li> It does a much nicer job than preloaded pads, which just are not strong enough for me.</li>
            <li> Also known as chickem skin it discolors certain parts of the skin and leaves it rough and bumpy with dark tiny dots that are what used to be pores.</li>
            <li> and I left it on for  at least 8 minutes the first time, for 12 minutes the second time.</li>
            <li> I left it on too long thus causing the damage.  </li>
            <li> I may not be leaving it long enough?  </li>
            <li> If your first time user don&#x27;t go all in, start off slow and work your way up.</li>
            <li> Every time I use it, I have actual spots of minor peeling--which I think is the point!</li>
            <li> Meaning, I exfoliated  in a few days, whereas nobody new it.</li>
            <li> Do not leave on your skin for too long, it will burn.  </li>
            <li> I do feel a stinging sensation after a few seconds, but perhaps I have not left it on long enough as it never causes me to peel.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t leave it on very long at all, because it does burn, but does not leave my skin dry or flakey.</li>
            <li> But I do have seen a slight improvement as in a bit of a glow, and even skin tone by only using it 2x.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having now tried this and dermarolling and seeing absolutely no results</li>
            <li> Just be careful around the cheek ares and mouth area</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not strong enough.</li>
            <li> I do this about every other week.</li>
            <li> and I had small burn marks on my face the next two days.</li>
            <li> I would be trying it again for a dark spot on my nose...</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t give me any down time.</li>
            <li> It did not remove my black spots on arm</li>
            <li> Use it to burn off my black spots.  </li>
            <li> It cuts the strength in half, but I keep it on all day.</li>
            <li> It stings a little when it goes on, but is unnoticable throughout the day.</li>
            <li> My skin had a few breakout areas.</li>
            <li> I tried it a couple of times but it burned me after a few seconds</li>
            <li> I left it on for one minute, as it&#x27;s been a few months since I&#x27;ve peeled, and had some faint frosting.  </li>
            <li> You also might want a small fan to blow on your face when you are using it.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I accidentally spilled about a third of the contents of  this bottle, but</li>
            <li> I even use it on my feet, and it gets rid of all the dead skin!</li>
            <li> I hardly had any response to the treatments.</li>
            <li> Was too late to return it, had thrown the receipt away.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this to put on my tattooed eyebrows because they were done too thick for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything wrong with my skin, maybe a little discoloration from when I used to pick.</li>
            <li> but i accidentally poured over half of mine down the drain :(</li>
            <li> i guess ill have to order another one soon :/</li>
            <li> My skin was soft afterwards, but it itched sooo bad!</li>
            <li> I wonder if I did anything wrong.....</li>
            <li> I was left with horrible burns/marks for months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tired of seeing idiotic product reviews for acids because people couldn&#x27;t be bothered to figure out how to use a chemical peel, and then get upset when they experience a deeper peel than they anticipated.  </li>
            <li> Just got the nerve up to try this product again, but this time just rinsed thoroughly with cold water and skipped baking soda neutralizer, then followed with aloe moisturizer....</li>
            <li> Terrible, broke me out,didn&#x27;t peel at all and a waste of money wouldn&#x27;t recommend!</li>
            <li> and it itches really bad and becomes so unbearable....</li>
            <li> I have BAD Kertosis Pilaris on my arms.</li>
            <li> nothing has happened and no change :(</li>
            <li> This product burnt those areas very badly.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;attacking a pathogen fungus there which is disgusting.</li>
            <li> I tried to return this product because it was horrible and did nothing to my face but break me outcontacted me and told me returning from the two days that you received</li>
            <li> Recommended use is one treatment per week, but my skin is awful</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve had no results at all from this product. I&#x27;ve done this peel 3-4 times waiting a couple weeks between each application. I read copiously about how to apply the glycolic acid as a peel, how to neutralize it, what to expect etc. Nothing. No redness, no peeling, no improvement in tone, texture, sunspots, etc. There is a serious burning sensation while the product is on the skin, which actually intensifies for a minute when you neutralize it...and afterward for a short time your skin will look very very shiny– not in a good way, like you have a layer of clear nail polish on your face. This too, will disappear fairly quickly, and you&#x27;ll be left with no noticeable changes or improvement to your skin. Actually during the period I&#x27;ve used this my skin has markedly  worsened but I think this is because I stop using my topical retinol after I do the &#x27;peel&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;Having now tried this and dermarolling and seeing absolutely no results I&#x27;ll go back to using retinA and wait until I can justify a real laser peel.</li>
            <li> A good variation for regular peels.  I use salicylic acid and lactic acid in rotation.</li>
            <li> Excellent product when used with neutralizer followed by a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have used this product a handful of times.  I do feel a stinging sensation after a few seconds, but perhaps I have not left it on long enough as it never causes me to peel.  However, I do think it has helped my skin and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> This peel is a good strength even for those who have used peels before. If you have not used a peel before, make sure to follow the directions closely.</li>
            <li> Good to use at home, as good results as from the aesthetician, just don&#x27;t leave on to long or you will burn  your skin.  I use about 1 time per week and it is the best exfoliater ever.</li>
            <li> Excellent product...very high potency. If you are a beginner to doing your own &amp;#34;peels&amp;#34;, only leave on for 30 seconds to a minute initially. Allow your skin to adjust to the procedure. Use regularly once a month and your will see results. Be sure to follow your &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; with a hyaluronic serum or collagen ampules or  other soothing serum.</li>
            <li> Maybe I don&#x27;t know how to use this product, it didn&#x27;t do anything for me but burn my cheek. So now I have burn mark on face, when I was attempting to get rid of the marks I already had.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not strong enough. I put it on for five minutes &amp; it barely tingles.</li>
            <li> awesome product. couldnt be better</li>
            <li> Bottle came broke open</li>
            <li> Product delivered just as advertised</li>
            <li> Love what this has done for my face... if you buy it follow the instructions and do not do extra time.  It has cleared up a lot of my acne and my mole removal scar is almost faded.  I am pleased with it!!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality product</li>
            <li> 4 applications over a one month period hasn&#x27;t removed the red marks from my face yet. This may or may not work for me and I expected better results by now.</li>
            <li> I read that you should start off at 30% but I started at 50%. It didn&#x27;t burn as much as people made it out to be, it tingled if anything. But then again I have a high tolerance for pain. I haven&#x27;t noticed any peeling yet, but I do have a beautiful glow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying to figure out what I wanted this stuff for but glad to have it  - just in case</li>
            <li> It will take more than ten peels for this to make my skin somewhat flawless. I don&#x27;t have anything wrong with my skin, maybe a little discoloration from when I used to pick. I&#x27;ve used this product five times and my face looks vibrant. My pores are smaller also.</li>
            <li> Just perfect for my skin. Makes my skin feel so smooth.</li>
            <li> Follow directions, and voila! Great product! Does what is promised.</li>
            <li> Very good product I am used to glycolic peels, but I recommend diluting it it to make a 25% for those new to glycolic peels.</li>
            <li> For me, it is a good purchase. I don&#x27;t like to give reviews on these types of product because everyone is different. I don&#x27;t know your history with peels or your knowledge on them. Be smart, it is your face. Research your purchases as I have before I perform an acid peel on my face. I read all directions that come with it and follow it to as directed. Listen to your skin. If your first time user don&#x27;t go all in, start off slow and work your way up. I really like this product. I&#x27;ve been doing peels for a while now. This didn&#x27;t give me any down time. Meaning, I exfoliated  in a few days, whereas nobody new it. No evidence on my face that my skin was going to peel. Just after the complete exfoliation that showed as good healthy younger skin.</li>
            <li> It did not remove my black spots on arm</li>
            <li> its ok not strong enough for mine personally but i also have been doing it a while. good product though for intermidiate</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had a chance to try my peel yet as I have a busy little  6 month old who keeps me distracted.&lt;br /&gt;I am however looking forward to my first attempt at a peel. Hopefully everything will go smoothly. I will update later on.</li>
            <li> This is, by far, the BEST glycolic acid peel for the amount paid. Keeps my blackheads practically NON existent and give my skin a constant, beautiful glow.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to work on me?? I started at one minute and have gone up to ten minutes....nothing has happened and no change :(</li>
            <li> Use it to burn off my black spots.  I can do them one at a time instead of going to the doctor and sitting through a long-painful treatment.</li>
            <li> This is strong and works. I did have 8 huge sores emerge on my face on one side which previously had no acne so I believe it is&lt;br /&gt;attacking a pathogen fungus there which is disgusting. There are so many wicked things from chem trails and GMO foods and&lt;br /&gt;nano parasites so I do not blame the product but instead believe it is eliminating a wicked pathogen.&lt;br /&gt;I will reiterate, the product does work beautifully on those lines around the mouth and chin. If it burns in areas just know it&lt;br /&gt;will clear it up and it is not the fault of the product in my estimation.</li>
            <li> I hardly had any response to the treatments. No peeling or redness and I left it on for  at least 8 minutes the first time, for 12 minutes the second time. I am going to try it for 15 minutes tonight.</li>
            <li> I left it on all night and my mole peeled of no problem, no bleeding.</li>
            <li> i love this! it truly is great. but i accidentally poured over half of mine down the drain :( i guess ill have to order another one soon :/</li>
            <li> Extremely strong.  Use with caution.  I received chemical burns.</li>
            <li> Not too strong, not too mild for me. No side effects so far so I am going to use it for a while to see..</li>
            <li> I am a licensed esthetician. I have dabbled in glycolics for years, but my favorite guinea pig is myself. I do NOT recommend this product for the face!! I have used this product, full strength to treat my Keratosis Pilarsis on my upper arms. The intense itching made me reluctant to do multiple treatments although I had good results. I left it on first for 8 minutes, then 10. My skin was soft afterwards, but it itched sooo bad! Then I hatched a brilliant plan: I use an eyedropper and mix it with my body lotion in my hand and apply. I use Baby Magic. It cuts the strength in half, but I keep it on all day. It stings a little when it goes on, but is unnoticable throughout the day. I do right out of the shower, then I wash my arms and reapply when I get home from work. After about 4 days, a sunburn like peel occurs. Its beautiful. The skin revealed underneath is smooth, non-blotchy and awesome. I do this about every other week. There is no cure for KP, but this is a great remedy for beautiful summer arms!</li>
            <li> I intentionally purchased a higher concentration in order to dilute to my tastes. Diluting to 12.5% gave my face a nice glow but didn&#x27;t burn or peel, which is not what I wanted. The instructions on the box are very clear about application, neutralization, and removal. I do not think that there are any problems with the efficacy of this glycolic acid, as someone who minored in biochemistry in school.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still in the process of using this product.. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2wks and I&#x27;m seeing good results so far..It is a slower process than I expected but great results thus far!!</li>
            <li> This product does as it promise,s, it is as good as a professional peel.i would definantely recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> it made my knees darker.....I wonder if I did anything wrong.....and it itches really bad and becomes so unbearable....it feels like 40 ants are crawling on my knees..I would be trying it again for a dark spot on my nose...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten professional chemical peels before and a couple years ago decided to stop spending so much money and do them myself. I&#x27;ve purchased from different vendors on amazon over the years and my skin just never peeled like at the spas. I was told that what I was buying was probably not medical grade. I did my first peel with this vendor and I&#x27;m sitting here writing a review six hours  after my first application and I am already starting to peel. I am so excited I have finally found truly excellent quality acid. Just be careful around the cheek ares and mouth area those are sensitive for most people. I personally use a fan brush to apply more evenly.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item after paying $150 plus tip for 3 professional acid peels and that was a discounted price.  It was good because I learned what they do but now feel I can do this at home.  It is very strong so you should do your research before you purchase.  I was up to 3 minutes with a 30% peel at the professional office so I figured I could go up to the 50%peel.  I started with one minute and am up to 3 minutes with this peel.  It is very strong.  If you have never used a peel you should probable start with a lower percent.  Definitely purchase a neutralizer as well which helps to deactivate the peel after your time is up. You also might want a small fan to blow on your face when you are using it.  It definitely feels like it is burning and a fan helps.</li>
            <li> I mixed it with 100% Aloe Vera Gel to minimize the burning. It will peel, so be careful, if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  I&#x27;m an experienced peeler, but I&#x27;ve bought buffered peels in the past.  This product is NOT buffered, which means it&#x27;s at the original pH.  I left it on for one minute, as it&#x27;s been a few months since I&#x27;ve peeled, and had some faint frosting.  A fan pointed at your face helps with the stinging, which is moderate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve never peeled before; do your research.  This is an acid. If used incorrectly, it could injure and disfigure you.  I&#x27;m tired of seeing idiotic product reviews for acids because people couldn&#x27;t be bothered to figure out how to use a chemical peel, and then get upset when they experience a deeper peel than they anticipated.  That has nothing to do with the product, and everything to do with an ignorant user.</li>
            <li> It really made my skin look flawless. No peeling tho. I am gonna continue using this. Great product!</li>
            <li> This 50% glycolic acid peel seems to be stronger than the last brand I bought that claimed to be 60%. Every time I use it, I have actual spots of minor peeling--which I think is the point! If you&#x27;re going to do peels at home, for the love of all that&#x27;s holy, be careful and get some good instructions. Don&#x27;t just slap this stuff on your face and think you&#x27;re going to wash it off and be instantly beautiful. It stings...like...mad. But it&#x27;s acid, so....</li>
            <li> It not too strong where I cant go out in public for a while, but strong enough to do some peeling and is fading old scars and lightening age marks.</li>
            <li> I peel quite regularly, and I love this product. Stings quite a bit can only leave on about 2 min. Bit works well, looking better all the time. :)</li>
            <li> This product turned out to be too strong and according to the instructions, would burn the skin.  Was too late to return it, had thrown the receipt away.  I still have it unopened!</li>
            <li> Very good product. First application one layer and slight peeling, second application 2 to 3 layers required 1 week to heal. Will continue with 1 week regime because my skin is looking noticeably better. Thanks</li>
            <li> This is a good product, but I want to give a word of warning from my experience. The first three applications I left product on for 1 minute then followed with suggested baking soda neutralizer, then rinsed. I was left with horrible burns/marks for months. Just got the nerve up to try this product again, but this time just rinsed thoroughly with cold water and skipped baking soda neutralizer, then followed with aloe moisturizer.... No burn. Left my skin smooth/shiny and soft, yet looking like I spent a nice day at the beach (i. e. touch of red glow). Will use again in a week. I am 40 years old with fine lines and a couple age spots. Hoping after more applications to reduce both. Thankful to have solved the burning problem. I guess baking soda neutralizer does not work for all people.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried a peel before, but at the age of 73 I decided to give it a try as I have some fairly &amp;#34;dug in&amp;#34; wrinkles! This stuff is powerful, but not scary. It works. It has made a noticeable difference in the lines over my upper lip and I&#x27;m working on the ones on either side of my mouth. You don&#x27;t want to get it too close to the corners of your mouth as that must be really sensitive, but once you get the hang of how to use it, I think you&#x27;ll like it! If it works on 73 year old skin, think what it could do for yours!!  : )&lt;br /&gt;(See, no wrinkles)  : )) (that&#x27;s just  a smile)</li>
            <li> this product is amazing. I leave it on for 10 minutes and I peel in sheets ... LOVE it, my old acne scars have lightened so much.</li>
            <li> Great product and service, thanks!</li>
            <li> Im training in esthics, and find this product to be exactly as advertised. Need to be careful since it is strong and unbuffered.</li>
            <li> Just as described and was fresh on arrival. Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> Very good product it wasn&#x27;t to strong and it gave me the same results that the spa gives for a fraction of the cost.  I would recommend this product for people that have gone to a spa or dermatologist and paid over a $100 to give this product a try.</li>
            <li> Be careful as this is very strong and can burn your skin if not careful. Mix it with pure water to get an easier application. It is everything promsied.</li>
            <li> This is really nice for refining pores and giving a fresh look. I don&#x27;t leave it on very long at all, because it does burn, but does not leave my skin dry or flakey. It does a much nicer job than preloaded pads, which just are not strong enough for me.</li>
            <li> It works as I thought it would. Nothing more</li>
            <li> I have only used this item twice, so far so good.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t done nothing to my face</li>
            <li> I tried to return this product because it was horrible and did nothing to my face but break me outcontacted me and told me returning from the two days that you received it send you a text seven days to see actual results from peelingjust use for customers hopefully not your customers don&#x27;t purchase this item because its a rip off</li>
            <li> Why would I pay $200 at my dermatologist when I can do a glycolic peel at home with this for a fraction of the cost?!?!?!?&lt;br /&gt;You cannot beat the price or effectiveness of this product!!! Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Professional Strength!!</li>
            <li> Great product.&lt;br /&gt;Asian skin. (30s) Bought to diminish sun spots and even skin tone a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Had one professional glycolic peel (30%) for 5 minutes and didn&#x27;t do much. Ordered this on Amazon to save money by doing it myself. Left on for 5 minutes and definitely took it up a notch from the 30%.  The first 24 hours my face stung, was red, had some red spots, and the corners of my nose were weepy. Loaded bag balm on my face, took some aspirin and redness and stinging reduced significantly. On day 2 and my face is sensitive, the red spots are still there and face is starting to peel. Looking forward to the end results!</li>
            <li> I just started using this after having finished my bottle of 40% peel.  Good instructions, no burns, and I feel&lt;br /&gt;like my skin is responding as it did with the 40% peel with some pore-tightening and some lightening of&lt;br /&gt;dark spots and just a bit of glowing undertone to my skin.  I tried some 30% pads a year ago with good results,&lt;br /&gt;but could not afford to reorder them. For about 5 months I used the 40% peel with some noticeable results.&lt;br /&gt; Unfortunately I accidentally spilled about a third of the contents of  this bottle, but&lt;br /&gt;I know that there are perhaps 10 treatments in a bottle and a similar treatment at a dermatologist&#x27;s office&lt;br /&gt;will cost a minimum of $40, so it is an excellent alternative to a treatment, just be sure to follow the time limits&lt;br /&gt;and have a neutralizer available before you begin in the event that your skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li> I love this peel is great gentle but effective on the skin. if you follow instructions you will do find ^.~</li>
            <li> This product did not peel it did nothing I tried it twice and it did nothing</li>
            <li> This product is medical grade and too strong for the general public! I used as directed on the box (not my first time getting a chemical peel, since they say don&#x27;t use if it&#x27;s your first time) and it caused bubbling, &amp;#34;frosting&amp;#34; (an esthetician term for whitening and peeling of the skin) and a mild skin burn on my skin. I only left it on for 2-3 minutes as directed. This product should ONLY be used under the supervision of a medical professional. Professional aestheticians are only allowed to purchase 30% glycolic acid. This product is too strong to be sold to non-professionals!</li>
            <li> I got a little too aggressive around my frown lines and chin, and ended up with a mild burn. My fault, I know. I will try it again, with a lighter touch. My skin really did not peel though??</li>
            <li> Terrible, broke me out,didn&#x27;t peel at all and a waste of money wouldn&#x27;t recommend!</li>
            <li> It seems everything we do comes with a learning curve.  My skin had a few breakout areas. This product burnt those areas very badly. This product is very potent. I left it on too long thus causing the damage.  I applied it using a sable paint brush. That was a mistake I should have used the cottontail, as the directions say. The cottontail allows control of the distribution and helps to limit the amount used.</li>
            <li> I started at 50%. It didn&#x27;t burn as much as people made it out to be, it tingled if anything. I did noticed some peeling after second day, and little itching, after that I got better. I would definantely recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This stuff works! I even use it on my feet, and it gets rid of all the dead skin! Buying more soon!</li>
            <li> Professional quality product. As a licensed cosmetologist, I recommend starting with a lower percentage peek and work your way up to this product.</li>
            <li> Good product. It is real 50% unbuffered Glycolic Acid. Good results. Not for amateurs.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to put on my tattooed eyebrows because they were done too thick for me. I tried it a couple of times but it burned me after a few seconds so I am no longer using it.</li>
            <li> it worked wonderful, I had stretch marks on my tummy as a result&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;of 2 pregnancies, As at now, my skin is as smooth as  a baby.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a different peel product for over a year and had great results,  until recently, evidently the company changed the formula and it no longer worked for me.  I decided to try ASDM Beverly Hills 50% and was pleased with results.</li>
            <li> used this on my face as well as on my arms. First time I did not mix with a lotion and left on for about 4 minutes. It took many of my freckles away and made my skin glow beautifully. Mixed it with lotion and used that overnight about once a week and had amazing results. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have BAD Kertosis Pilaris on my arms. Also known as chickem skin it discolors certain parts of the skin and leaves it rough and bumpy with dark tiny dots that are what used to be pores. When I first used the acid on a cotton ball it Burned my skin and caused it to bubble and bleed with puss in just 3 minutes... but 4 days later after showering 6 times in a four day time frame and using the acid once more... my skin lightened and the puss sores scabbed up and fell off. Feels smoother and looks cleaner in just 6 days. Recommended use is one treatment per week, but my skin is awful so 2-3 does the trick! This is real acid so be careful!</li>
            <li> I wish I would have ordered the 30% instead. My face burned right away and I had small burn marks on my face the next two days. I&#x27;ll try to leave it on for a brief couple of minutes next time.</li>
            <li> Been Ordering A While Now, Always Fast Shipping And Great Products!!</li>
            <li> Was easy to use, made my skin baby smooth, glowing and evened out the dark spots. I only used once but plan on using it again soon! The seller was very professional, my order arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Too strong for my face. Felt a burning and tingling sensation. Left it on my face for two minutes and neutralized it right after. My face turned all red which I think is natural. Although I have two extra red spots on my cheeks which looks like burn. I don&#x27;t know if this is normal and part of the process. I hope it goes away soon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in day of my peel. The red &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; on my cheeks seems lesser but still distracting. No peeling has happened and my skin in the chin area still feels a bit rough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have clear skin except for some sun spots which I wanted to go away. I don&#x27;t know if this thing works. It&#x27;s probably too early to say. They say it would take 7-10 days to see the actual results of the glycolic peel. I am hoping that I&#x27;m just in the purging stage that would hopefully go away</li>
            <li> What you see is what you get. Great stuff. No problems at all.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it is suppose to.</li>
            <li> Great seller. Highly satisfied.</li>
            <li> Great Product, very strong though.  Please read instruction on how to apply . Do not leave on your skin for too long, it will burn.  It&#x27;s a professional product use as directed.</li>
            <li> So far so good, have used it twice already and I leave it on for 3 minutes. I do experience a burning sensation and I do use a neutralizer baking soda and water solution right after, following with washing my face and and then using a toner and heavy moisturizer.  I do not peel after the treatment nor do I see any dryness.  I may not be leaving it long enough?  But I do have seen a slight improvement as in a bit of a glow, and even skin tone by only using it 2x.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my adult son to even out old acne scars.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I see instant results after using this product. i use on my face to tighten facial skin and decrease scars on my face. Works Good. Received in a timely manner and in good condition. Will order from this seller again.</li>
