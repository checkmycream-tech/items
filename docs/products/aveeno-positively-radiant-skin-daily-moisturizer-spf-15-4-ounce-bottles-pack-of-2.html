            <li>It&#x27;s awesome basically.  </li>
            <li>It really IS impressive!  </li>
            <li>you KNOW that they can&#x27;t be good for you!!</li>

            <li>So the price is great and the quality is great.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>:P  </li>
            <li>good price, great delivery.</li>
            <li>I have to say, this was really a pleasant surprise -</li>
            <li>Good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>So good, in fact, that I&#x27;ll probably be returning the tube I just bought but hadn&#x27;t opened yet.    </li>
            <li>It smells good</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, light-weight and feels great!</li>
            <li>Its a good product and a foundation of my morning arsenal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good moisturizer, but sometimes it feels greasy after application.</li>
            <li>It truly has evened out my skin tone and it gives me a very healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>as well love it has sunblock in it it a plus makes skin feel great</li>
            <li>Ok, I&#x27;m a guy, I won&#x27;t lie!  </li>
            <li>... LOVE everything!  </li>
            <li>Love this face cream!</li>
            <li>A pea-size dab leaves a nice feeling on skin.</li>
            <li>is something I own, but use about once every two weeks.  </li>
            <li>On top of that the scent of the product is pleasant and mild.     </li>
            <li>I use this stuff EVERY day to keep my skin glowing, smooth and cancer free!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many over the years - from the super cheap off brands at Wal-Mart, to Dr. Perricone products from Sephora (honestly, the wal-mart stuff was as good, sometimes better).  </li>
            <li>It has protected me from the sun and much more.     </li>
            <li>I am glad I found it.</li>
            <li>cuz I kinda LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love how it feels once it has been applied.</li>
            <li>But, I tried it again and it doesnt have that problem any more.</li>
            <li>It also does brighten skin and just make it look better -</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s, I&#x27;m trying to take better care of my skin.  </li>
            <li>I decided that my skin looked so healthy because of the mineral makeup</li>
            <li>love this cream as well as many of aveno products ~</li>
            <li>Plus it gave me a more even skin tone, like it said it would.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>i absolutely love love love it, have been using it for almost a year now.</li>
            <li>But both products are worth the monies!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very impressed and will be picking up a few more bottles to have on hand.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, and fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>It does everything Dior does, refracts and deflects light around imperfections, including the dark/light circles under my eyes, and evens my skin tone for a well-polished look.  </li>
            <li>This product really gives my skin a nice even look.  </li>
            <li>I have since gone back to using this Aveeno product and my skin looks great again</li>
            <li>(especially if you&#x27;re a nice guy!)  </li>
            <li>I just love it and really recommend it.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that it&#x27;s as good, if not better, than my $40 1.7oz tube of Dior tinted moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really review much on here, but had to write that this product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>but I find that it has been wholly worth the price.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and my skin tone looks better.  </li>
            <li>Aveeno can be a bit more spendy than some of the other moisturizes you find in the store (though it is definitely more affordable through Amazon)</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried many other face moisturizers over the years but this is our favorite.</li>
            <li>And looking good improves other people&#x27;s perception of you</li>
            <li>When the Dermatologist recommended Aveeno with SPF-15 for my husband who had many skin cancers, he used it daily and liked the non-greasy feel it left on his face and neck, arms, etc.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many many other daily moisturizers but I just love this one.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;d seen this moisturizer at Costco for a VERY reasonable price and decided to see what people on Amazon thought of it.  </li>
            <li>However, I could tell the first time I Used Aveeno Radiant Skin Daily Moisturizer that it was going to be safe for my skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of expensive moisturizers by Mary Kay and Clinique, but aver no works the best</li>
            <li>Its very moistur-riffic without leaving your skin greasy at all!    </li>
            <li>My face has a nice polished look that other people have noticed.  </li>
            <li>For the last several years, after trying many different brands of makeup, I&#x27;d settled on Dior&#x27;s \\&quot;tinted moisturizer\\&quot; in order to do the job of evening out my skin tone and hiding minor blemishes, while diffusing light to produce the soft, filtered light look that only comes to people with perfect skin and movie stars.  </li>
            <li>and it makes my face so super soft!</li>
            <li>My face did not burn and maintained a nice moisturized look all day and less blemishes.  </li>
            <li>Since I started using this lotion on my face my skin is much clearer.</li>
            <li>I guess when it says it evens skin tone, it is really applying color to your skin.</li>
            <li>much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much cheaper to boot.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s much cheaper at costco, i suggest you guy it from there instead of on amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>are people really looking at what&#x27;s in this stuff?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product ain&#x27;t moisturizing enough for normal to dry skin types, though it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>However, it didn&#x27;t take long before I noticed unsightly, orange stains on necklines, and collars of his tee shirts and light colored polo&#x27;s (or anywhere else the fabric touched the treated skin areas.)  </li>
            <li>Now, the majority of the time, I don&#x27;t have any blemishes, my pores are smaller, and my skin tone is much more even and looks healthier, not too pallid or red.     </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>sometimes the big box store still wins out, even after Amazon Subscriptions discount.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been looking for a new lotion with SPF and brown spot reduction that can be used all over my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent more on some moisturizers for the same qualities.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and some products (even those labeled hypoallergenic)cause my skin to \\&quot;break</li>
            <li>Overall, this keeps my skin from becoming dry and flaky and</li>
            <li>/&gt;Really sad products like this are marketed so successfully.......</li>
            <li>My skin went right back to looking less healthy, no glow, and bumpy minor breakouts etc.</li>
            <li>I thought I would try this Aveeno Positively Radiant Skin Daily Moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I am 28 years old and have always had bouts of acne here</li>
            <li>I was surprised by all the reviews, so I invested in it ($20 for 2 bottles of 4 oz.) and took it home to try.  </li>
            <li>The radiant part of the lotion comes from tiny \\&quot;sparkle\\&quot; like things in the lotion itself, so it doesn&#x27;t really make your skin glow.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and sinks right in immediately.  </li>
            <li>It kind of smells like sunblock and has a slight slight shimmer in it.</li>
            <li>I started using this product mainly for daily sun protection.</li>
            <li>When this supply runs out, I&#x27;ll be back in the market for a new lotion.</li>
            <li>Um, omg so, I have the CVS brand of this stuff, so I guess it&#x27;s not a totally accurate review, but if it really is made exactly the same way</li>
            <li>Fragrance isn&#x27;t as nice as the expensive stuff, but it fades away.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m super lazy.  </li>
            <li>I first got it from my mom when my anti-acne moisturizer was leaving my face tight and flakey.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m moderately big on skin care, because I wanna look decent as long as possible.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t talk enough about Aveeno products in general.  </li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t talk enough about Aveeno products in general.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more expensive than the other moisturizers, but well worth it.  </li>
            <li> You only need a small amount, it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, it&#x27;s not greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> I usually switch moisturizers after the bottle runs out, but I went and got another one of this, and I bought the CVS brand version of the Positively Radiant face</li>
            <li> After my first use (and after a few hours), I started sneezing, but worse, my eyes started watering, stinging and became very puffy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel its very similar to the quality of Department Store moisturizer which tends to be about the same price for at least 1/8 of the product.  </li>
            <li> and I actually feel like I am missing something without it.  </li>
            <li> It works as expected as an every day lotion.</li>
            <li> I know when I bought this a few years ago, it would start to rub off when I applied something over it, or just rubbed my face.</li>
            <li> BUT  you can spend LESS buying it at B.J.&#x27;s wholesale!  </li>
            <li> I have never enjoyed putting anything on my face, it is either too heavy, oily, smelly, etc</li>
            <li> , I am totally addicted... will use this as long as I can afford it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Aniston&#x27;s since the thankfully past days of Brangelina.</li>
            <li> Only very bad thing It turned my fingernails orange.</li>
            <li> and there, nothing really bad but at least two or three blemishes on my face always.</li>
            <li> Considering the cost of replacing the clothing, this is one expensive product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using Aveeno products for my face for almost two years and this product specifically for one year. I am 28 years old and have always had bouts of acne here and there, nothing really bad but at least two or three blemishes on my face always. I started using this product mainly for daily sun protection. It has protected me from the sun and much more.     Since I started using this lotion on my face my skin is much clearer. Occasionally I use the Aveeno face wash pads but typically I only wash my face with water twice a day so I know that it is the lotion that has improved my skin.  Now, the majority of the time, I don&#x27;t have any blemishes, my pores are smaller, and my skin tone is much more even and looks healthier, not too pallid or red.     I have never enjoyed putting anything on my face, it is either too heavy, oily, smelly, etc but when I wear this none of those are an issue and I actually feel like I am missing something without it.  On top of that the scent of the product is pleasant and mild.     Aveeno can be a bit more spendy than some of the other moisturizes you find in the store (though it is definitely more affordable through Amazon) but I find that it has been wholly worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and some products (even those labeled hypoallergenic)cause my skin to \\&quot;break out.\\&quot; However, I could tell the first time I Used Aveeno Radiant Skin Daily Moisturizer that it was going to be safe for my skin. My face did not burn and maintained a nice moisturized look all day and less blemishes.  Great Product! I am glad I found it.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer. Only very bad thing It turned my fingernails orange. As I read the back of the label on this product, it stated it may stain some fabrics. But fingernails were not mentioned. Fingernail Polish Remover had to be used, which worked. I guess when it says it evens skin tone, it is really applying color to your skin.</li>
            <li> I have used it for over a year at Doctors advice for SPF 15 on my face. I am very happy with the product and its results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really review much on here, but had to write that this product is amazing.  It truly has evened out my skin tone and it gives me a very healthy glow.  It&#x27;s a little more expensive than the other moisturizers, but well worth it.  Highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Um, omg so, I have the CVS brand of this stuff, so I guess it&#x27;s not a totally accurate review, but if it really is made exactly the same way then it&#x27;s basically the same.  I use this stuff EVERY day to keep my skin glowing, smooth and cancer free!!  :P  It&#x27;s light, and fragrance free.  It&#x27;s awesome basically.  I usually switch moisturizers after the bottle runs out, but I went and got another one of this, and I bought the CVS brand version of the Positively Radiant face wash too, cuz I kinda LOVE this stuff.  If you can get your hands on the CVS version, it&#x27;s def. much cheaper.  But both products are worth the monies!!  GET IT!!  (I swear I&#x27;m just a regular Amazonian!)</li>
            <li> When the Dermatologist recommended Aveeno with SPF-15 for my husband who had many skin cancers, he used it daily and liked the non-greasy feel it left on his face and neck, arms, etc.  However, it didn&#x27;t take long before I noticed unsightly, orange stains on necklines, and collars of his tee shirts and light colored polo&#x27;s (or anywhere else the fabric touched the treated skin areas.)  I&#x27;ve soaked them, used every detergent on the market, and even tried remedies from \\&quot;Haley&#x27;s Hints\\&quot;.  Nothing works, they won&#x27;t come out!!  Considering the cost of replacing the clothing, this is one expensive product.</li>
            <li> This product ain&#x27;t moisturizing enough for normal to dry skin types, though it&#x27;s a good product. I use it by mixing with an emollient (pears baby oil) in my hands before rubbing on my skin. My advice? Use only for oily skin.</li>
            <li> good price, great delivery.</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;m a guy, I won&#x27;t lie!  I&#x27;m moderately big on skin care, because I wanna look decent as long as possible.  And looking good improves other people&#x27;s perception of you (especially if you&#x27;re a nice guy!)  So, I buy skin care products from time to time.  I&#x27;ve tried many over the years - from the super cheap off brands at Wal-Mart, to Dr. Perricone products from Sephora (honestly, the wal-mart stuff was as good, sometimes better).  I also use basic foundation in order to polish the tone and quality of the look of my skin.  For the last several years, after trying many different brands of makeup, I&#x27;d settled on Dior&#x27;s \\&quot;tinted moisturizer\\&quot; in order to do the job of evening out my skin tone and hiding minor blemishes, while diffusing light to produce the soft, filtered light look that only comes to people with perfect skin and movie stars.  But I&#x27;d seen this moisturizer at Costco for a VERY reasonable price and decided to see what people on Amazon thought of it.  I was surprised by all the reviews, so I invested in it ($20 for 2 bottles of 4 oz.) and took it home to try.  I can honestly say that it&#x27;s as good, if not better, than my $40 1.7oz tube of Dior tinted moisturizer.  So good, in fact, that I&#x27;ll probably be returning the tube I just bought but hadn&#x27;t opened yet.    It does everything Dior does, refracts and deflects light around imperfections, including the dark/light circles under my eyes, and evens my skin tone for a well-polished look.  It really IS impressive!  And at this cost, I&#x27;ll probably never leave home without wearing it, it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. I first got it from my mom when my anti-acne moisturizer was leaving my face tight and flakey. I was worried this aveeno product would leave my skin oily with breakouts but since it is noncomedogenic (sp?) it doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts and leaves skin properly moisturized. I still use my anti acne face wash but follow with this moisturizer. It kind of smells like sunblock and has a slight slight shimmer in it. It is cheaper to buy from amazon than from target or walmart.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel greasy.  I love how it feels once it has been applied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many many other daily moisturizers but I just love this one. My skin is so soft and my skin tone looks better.  It smells good and it&#x27;s not greasy. I just love it and really recommend it.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, light-weight and feels great! Not greasy at all. I&#x27;ve spent more on some moisturizers for the same qualities. Fragrance isn&#x27;t as nice as the expensive stuff, but it fades away. A pea-size dab leaves a nice feeling on skin.</li>
            <li> I know when I bought this a few years ago, it would start to rub off when I applied something over it, or just rubbed my face. But, I tried it again and it doesnt have that problem any more. I have to say, this was really a pleasant surprise - it actually does even out skin tone with continuous use. It won&#x27;t give you like airbrushed looking skin, but it definitely fades scars. It also does brighten skin and just make it look better - I think the &#x27;radiant&#x27; word describes it well, except not quite as radiant as you would hope anything to make you. Lastly, it moisturizes, as you would expect it to. Its a good product and a foundation of my morning arsenal.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s, I&#x27;m trying to take better care of my skin.  Age spots and wrinkles are beginning to show and while I&#x27;m not freaking out, I would like to minimize these signs of aging. However, I&#x27;m super lazy.  I never wear foundation and mascara is something I own, but use about once every two weeks.  This product really gives my skin a nice even look.  It&#x27;s not greasy and sinks right in immediately.  I&#x27;m very impressed and will be picking up a few more bottles to have on hand. My face has a nice polished look that other people have noticed.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend this one!</li>
            <li> I tried this moisturizer out because I had a coupon, once it ran out I decided that my skin looked so healthy because of the mineral makeup so I went back to the 5$ dove spf 15 moisturizer I was using before. My skin went right back to looking less healthy, no glow, and bumpy minor breakouts etc. I have since gone back to using this Aveeno product and my skin looks great again, I am totally addicted... will use this as long as I can afford it. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The radiant part of the lotion comes from tiny \\&quot;sparkle\\&quot; like things in the lotion itself, so it doesn&#x27;t really make your skin glow. It&#x27;s a good moisturizer, but sometimes it feels greasy after application. I would continue to buy the product regardless.</li>
            <li> love this cream as well as many of aveno products ~ as well love it has sunblock in it it a plus makes skin feel great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of expensive moisturizers by Mary Kay and Clinique, but aver no works the best and it&#x27;s much cheaper to boot. Plus it gave me a more even skin tone, like it said it would.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost never swayed into purchasing products advertised on TV. I&#x27;ve been a fan of Aniston&#x27;s since the thankfully past days of Brangelina. I&#x27;d been looking for a new lotion with SPF and brown spot reduction that can be used all over my skin. I took a flyer on this product and have been disappointed. It works as expected as an every day lotion. Where it epically fails is brown spot reduction. After 6 weeks of *almost* daily use, I do not see any noticeable brown spot reduction. This makes me question the SPF quality as well. When this supply runs out, I&#x27;ll be back in the market for a new lotion.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t talk enough about Aveeno products in general.  I use their body wash, moisturizer, tinted moisturizer, cleansing pads, etc... LOVE everything!  But specifically about this product.. I feel its very similar to the quality of Department Store moisturizer which tends to be about the same price for at least 1/8 of the product.  So the price is great and the quality is great.  Its very moistur-riffic without leaving your skin greasy at all!    BUT  you can spend LESS buying it at B.J.&#x27;s wholesale!  Compare prices with big box stores if you have access to them.. sometimes the big box store still wins out, even after Amazon Subscriptions discount.</li>
            <li> Love this face cream!</li>
            <li> Does not do what it claims, not recommended</li>
            <li> My husband &amp; I use this every morning. We&#x27;ve tried many other face moisturizers over the years but this is our favorite. You only need a small amount, it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, it&#x27;s not greasy or heavy. Why 4 stars? It&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. There are tiny pieces of glitter in the lotion, I guess that&#x27;s where the radiance comes in, not a big fan of that addition. Overall, this keeps my skin from becoming dry and flaky and I like knowing there is sunscreen in it to protect from the sun&#x27;s rays.</li>
            <li> and it makes my face so super soft! i absolutely love love love it, have been using it for almost a year now. but it&#x27;s much cheaper at costco, i suggest you guy it from there instead of on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;my mom got it 2 for 11.00 :b</li>
            <li> I thought I would try this Aveeno Positively Radiant Skin Daily Moisturizer. After my first use (and after a few hours), I started sneezing, but worse, my eyes started watering, stinging and became very puffy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is dangerous.........are people really looking at what&#x27;s in this stuff?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really sad products like this are marketed so successfully.......you KNOW that they can&#x27;t be good for you!!</li>
            <li> I only received one bottle&lt;br /&gt;and I paid the ful price&lt;br /&gt;When I tried to contact the company, I was totally unsuccessful&lt;br /&gt;NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM THESE GUYS AGAIN  !!!!!</li>
