            <li>and i could not agree more.</li>
            <li>might be just overwhelmed since i got all my 5 perfumes today. :))</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this perfume but ordered this for my sister as a gift.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to all my friends who love scents that stay for hours.</li>
            <li>i love how it doesnt smell cheap at all!</li>
            <li>It lasted more than 8 hours on me.</li>
            <li>Very large bottle for a good price.</li>
            <li>I loved it and thanks so much because you made my purchase a really good purchase and a amazing item like this</li>
            <li>really nice sweet smell...</li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume and I was super excited that I got it on Amazon for this price!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sweet, candy like almost.</li>
            <li>I asked her straight up what she is wearing because she smelled so good.</li>
            <li>I used to think the original fantasy perfume was my favorite, but as soon as I tried this one</li>
            <li>scent is better than the original I believe.</li>
            <li>I am really happy I could buy such a good-sized bottle of one my favorite perfumes inexpensively.</li>
            <li>this were a gift for my girlfriend , this is like the first version with a plus berry smell, so sweet , so good.</li>
            <li>Smells great &amp; lasts a fair amount of time (I&#x27;d say a few hours for a couple light spritzes).</li>
            <li>and I get compliments on it all the time, very unique sweet smell but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>The scent lasts all day and is reminiscent of fruit loops (it&#x27;s not weird, it&#x27;s wonderful).</li>
            <li>It really smells nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall: This perfume smells great and if you love the other Britney Spears perfume, this is a must have also!</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s definitely worth trying!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited</li>
            <li>but the smells is not that great like the pink one......</li>
            <li>I love sweet scents but this one is too much for me.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t eat vanilla bean, but it smells good enough to eat</li>
            <li>I have read someone said it&#x27;s too sweet</li>
            <li>I am in my early twenties and get many compliments on how great I smell even after a long day at work.  </li>
            <li>Luckily there was a lot of cushioning inside to protect the perfume.</li>
            <li>The shipping was quick too.</li>
            <li>it wears off quickly.</li>
            <li>young and old lol</li>
            <li>It has a very sweet candy like scent, almost cotton candy and is a lil nauseating if you spray to much.</li>
            <li>Very pretty bottle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun, fruity without being too sweet, and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I knew this was my new favorite.</li>
            <li>I definitely use this for a night on the town and its amazing.</li>
            <li>For the price its so worth it.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll notice that its a beautiful blue colored bottle with tiny rhinestones placed onto the bottle to give it that feminine touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is limited edition, better hurry and get yours today!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I would be totally in love with this perfume it would last beyond 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>i love it, recomend totally</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be getting more when this bottle runs out.</li>
            <li>It smells HOT.  </li>
            <li>This perfume became a staple after I first tried it some 6 years ago.</li>
            <li>My first impression was it smells like vitamins?</li>
            <li>Brit really hit it on this one!</li>
            <li>it was so much cheaper than the retail stores, thank you so much it was just what I wanted!</li>
            <li>Such a sweet scent!</li>
            <li>I really wish there was a way where I could return it</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really smell that.</li>
            <li>The name really describes when to wear this perfume.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to try it  out!</li>
            <li>This is not the real midnight</li>
            <li>and they said it is 100% real ..</li>
            <li>I would&#x27;ve never thought I would love Britney Spears perfume (it&#x27;s a prejudice here, I know, but I feel that many stars just stamp out &amp;#34;sweet scents&amp;#34; like from a conveyor), alas it is here, on my shelf, and I always buy new one</li>
            <li>and I will continue to buy this as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li>you won&#x27;t go wrong with this, it&#x27;s beautiful..</li>
            <li>She always smells really nice but never overwhelming.</li>
            <li>looked at the notes of this particular perfume for a couple months</li>
            <li>Long lasting and not to strong!</li>
            <li>When I heard that this was a limited edition I had to buy a couple extra to make sure I would be set for a while.  </li>
            <li>Package came brand new</li>
            <li>Long lasting sweet smell!</li>
            <li>It is the exact same thing just without the box and the spherical cap.</li>
            <li>I decided to go to amazon and here it is, smells exactly the same as the dregs in my old bottle.</li>
            <li>It was brand new in completely sealed packaging and the product itself was completely intact.</li>
            <li>I bought because some friends kept ranting about it and honestly, I do not find the smell appropriate for an almost 30 year old.</li>
            <li>When I ran out of my old midnight fantasy</li>
            <li>Hopefully its not broken as it is a christmas present.</li>
            <li>Despite what Britney Spears might mean to you, this is one sexy perfume.  </li>
            <li>My second favorite Britney perfume (only second to Curious:</li>
            <li>took the top off and sprayed on my pulse point and at first you get a burst of sweetness, then afterwards I get a soapy faint blueberry smell that&#x27;s somewhat mixed with musk.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually a little lenient when it comes to perfumes and or body sprays but this particular perfume (the dry down) gives me a head-ache.</li>
            <li>This perfume is long lasting and keeps me fresh all day long.  </li>
            <li>I am obsessed with this perfume, by far my favorite by Britney</li>

            <li> I asked her straight up what she is wearing because she smelled so good.</li>
            <li> I used to think the original fantasy perfume was my favorite, but as soon as I tried this one</li>
            <li> scent is better than the original I believe.</li>
            <li> I am really happy I could buy such a good-sized bottle of one my favorite perfumes inexpensively.</li>
            <li> this were a gift for my girlfriend , this is like the first version with a plus berry smell, so sweet , so good.</li>
            <li> Smells great &amp; lasts a fair amount of time (I&#x27;d say a few hours for a couple light spritzes).</li>
            <li> and I get compliments on it all the time, very unique sweet smell but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> The scent lasts all day and is reminiscent of fruit loops (it&#x27;s not weird, it&#x27;s wonderful).</li>
            <li> It really smells nice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall: This perfume smells great and if you love the other Britney Spears perfume, this is a must have also!</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s definitely worth trying!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited</li>
            <li> but the smells is not that great like the pink one......</li>
            <li> I love sweet scents but this one is too much for me.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t eat vanilla bean, but it smells good enough to eat</li>
            <li> I have read someone said it&#x27;s too sweet</li>
            <li> I am in my early twenties and get many compliments on how great I smell even after a long day at work.  </li>

            <li> young and old lol</li>

            <li> Very pretty bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun, fruity without being too sweet, and it lasts all day.</li>

            <li> This perfume became a staple after I first tried it some 6 years ago.</li>
            <li> My first impression was it smells like vitamins?</li>
            <li> Brit really hit it on this one!</li>
            <li> it was so much cheaper than the retail stores, thank you so much it was just what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Such a sweet scent!</li>
            <li> I really wish there was a way where I could return it</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really smell that.</li>
            <li> The name really describes when to wear this perfume.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to try it  out!</li>
            <li> This is not the real midnight</li>
            <li> and they said it is 100% real ..</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve never thought I would love Britney Spears perfume (it&#x27;s a prejudice here, I know, but I feel that many stars just stamp out &amp;#34;sweet scents&amp;#34; like from a conveyor), alas it is here, on my shelf, and I always buy new one</li>
            <li> and I will continue to buy this as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t go wrong with this, it&#x27;s beautiful..</li>
            <li> She always smells really nice but never overwhelming.</li>
            <li> looked at the notes of this particular perfume for a couple months</li>
            <li> Long lasting and not to strong!</li>
            <li> When I heard that this was a limited edition I had to buy a couple extra to make sure I would be set for a while.  </li>
            <li> Package came brand new</li>
            <li> Long lasting sweet smell!</li>
            <li> It is the exact same thing just without the box and the spherical cap.</li>
            <li> I decided to go to amazon and here it is, smells exactly the same as the dregs in my old bottle.</li>
            <li> It was brand new in completely sealed packaging and the product itself was completely intact.</li>
            <li> I bought because some friends kept ranting about it and honestly, I do not find the smell appropriate for an almost 30 year old.</li>
            <li> When I ran out of my old midnight fantasy</li>
            <li> Hopefully its not broken as it is a christmas present.</li>
            <li> Despite what Britney Spears might mean to you, this is one sexy perfume.  </li>
            <li> My second favorite Britney perfume (only second to Curious:</li>
            <li> took the top off and sprayed on my pulse point and at first you get a burst of sweetness, then afterwards I get a soapy faint blueberry smell that&#x27;s somewhat mixed with musk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a little lenient when it comes to perfumes and or body sprays but this particular perfume (the dry down) gives me a head-ache.</li>
            <li> This perfume is long lasting and keeps me fresh all day long.  </li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this perfume, by far my favorite by Britney</li>
            <li> and it is very long lasting too.</li>
            <li> how it smells&amp;#34; feeling, because several different perfumes might use the same ingredient in several different ways and they will have nothing in common; but I would guess vanilla in here...</li>
            <li> When I got the package delivered the outside box was crushed.</li>
            <li> , every time I wear it, i get compliments, it&#x27;s long lasting, it smells sweet like cotton candy, and the boys go crazy when they are kissing me</li>
            <li> So long as Amazon sells it, I&#x27;ll be buying it!!!</li>
            <li> Also, there were some other perfume samples, coupons, and a pocket mirror included in the package.</li>
            <li> other Britney spears products</li>
            <li> I am not sure when this product will go out since it&#x27;s a limited edition but hurry and try one today!  </li>
            <li> So of course curiosity killed the cat</li>
            <li> and I find it pleasing and floral, but not to heavy.</li>
            <li> If your skeptical, head to a mall or local Sephora location and try it out</li>
            <li> seriously, like a gum drop in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I was addicted to both.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Best smelling perfume</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume! I wish stores that carried this would carry the larger ounce bottles, but they never seem to.  I used to buy this at Target; however, they were sold out so I turned to amazon.  When I heard that this was a limited edition I had to buy a couple extra to make sure I would be set for a while.  This perfume is long lasting and keeps me fresh all day long.  Amazon sells it cheaper than many retail stores I have tried buying this product from.  I am in my early twenties and get many compliments on how great I smell even after a long day at work.  The perfume is a smell with a mixture of different fruits and has a vanilla mix to it as well.  I am continually impressed with the Brittney Spears line of perfume but this would have to be my favorite.  I would recommend this perfume to anyone and everyone.  It would accommodate everyone&#x27;s needs from teenagers to mothers.  Along with an excellent smell, it comes in a fancy bottle that impresses everyone that sees it.  I am not sure when this product will go out since it&#x27;s a limited edition but hurry and try one today!  Excellent product!!</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume.  I get several compliments daily.. I will never stop buying it!</li>
            <li> Lasts all day! Such a sweet scent!</li>
            <li> Very good flavor. Mixes into most drinks well too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m someone who doesn&#x27;t go out of my way to smell a sample of a fragrance before purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked at the notes of this particular perfume for a couple months and I heard mostly great things about it. So of course curiosity killed the cat and I ended up purchasing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening the box you&#x27;ll notice that its a beautiful blue colored bottle with tiny rhinestones placed onto the bottle to give it that feminine touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took the top off and sprayed on my pulse point and at first you get a burst of sweetness, then afterwards I get a soapy faint blueberry smell that&#x27;s somewhat mixed with musk. I&#x27;m usually a little lenient when it comes to perfumes and or body sprays but this particular perfume (the dry down) gives me a head-ache. I really wish there was a way where I could return it but I can&#x27;t. I&#x27;ll see if someone likes it; if not its just on my vanity for looks.</li>
            <li> Love this smell. Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> When I ran out of my old midnight fantasy I was sad to discover that I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores! I decided to go to amazon and here it is, smells exactly the same as the dregs in my old bottle. I am so happy, both my boyfriend and I agree that this sent is very nice and fruity and now I don&#x27;t have to worry about where to get it.</li>
            <li> When I got the package delivered the outside box was crushed. Luckily there was a lot of cushioning inside to protect the perfume. Hopefully its not broken as it is a christmas present.</li>
            <li> This is one of my all-time favorite perfumes! It&#x27;s fun, fruity without being too sweet, and it lasts all day. The shipping was quick too. My perfume arrived in three days! I&#x27;ll definitely buy my perfume from this seller again</li>
            <li> For the price its so worth it.I&#x27;ll always order this and tell all my girlfriends to get theirs from here as well.</li>
            <li> Smells sooo good. I like to mix it with Insolence by Guerlain. They smell perfect together.</li>
            <li> I love the scent, however- it wears off quickly. I would be totally in love with this perfume it would last beyond 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> i love it, recomend totally</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with my order. It was brand new in completely sealed packaging and the product itself was completely intact.</li>
            <li> I can not believe how great this smells! It&#x27;s too bad this is limited edition, better hurry and get yours today! Simply beautiful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always embarrassed when people ask what perfume I&#x27;m wearing. I suppose being 41 and wearing Britney Spears perfume is a bit adolescent, but I really love it!!!</li>
            <li> Smells soooo amazing! Long lasting and not to strong!</li>
            <li> smells good. soo good. flirty scent.  and men always compliment the scent and how i smell.  not overpowering either. young and old lol</li>
            <li> This perfume smelled amazing. It&#x27;s very sweet, candy like almost. Very large bottle for a good price. Also, there were some other perfume samples, coupons, and a pocket mirror included in the package. I&#x27;ll definitely be getting more when this bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> Despite what Britney Spears might mean to you, this is one sexy perfume.  It smells HOT.  All girls should wear this.</li>
            <li> This was a gift to my girldfriend and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this perfume, by far my favorite by Britney and you can&#x27;t beat the price here. Package came brand new and I get compliments on it all the time, very unique sweet smell but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> arrived on time and will order again</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume and I was super excited that I got it on Amazon for this price!! It had the softest sweetest smell ever!!</li>
            <li> Fair price! this were a gift for my girlfriend , this is like the first version with a plus berry smell, so sweet , so good.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite smelling perfume ever!!!! I used to think the original fantasy perfume was my favorite, but as soon as I tried this one I knew this was my new favorite. Smells like a mix of blueberries and cotton candy. It&#x27;s just amazing. I am 22 and wear it during the day or when I am out clubbing. Get compliments everywhere I go.</li>
            <li> smells ok,  i broght it for my girlfriend. and she like it,  but the smells is not that great like the pink one......</li>
            <li> perfect gift for a girlfriend</li>
            <li> this is a very good product I am recommending it to all who love perfumes&lt;br /&gt;and other Britney spears products</li>
            <li> es un vendedor responsable..</li>
            <li> Shipping: I bought this product on June 5th, 2014 and received it on June 9th 2014. I had no problems with the shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product: I love any Britney Spears perfume. I think it&#x27;s the best line of perfume. This smells really good. My mom thinks it smells somewhat sugary like cotton candy but I don&#x27;t really smell that. The name really describes when to wear this perfume. I think this would be best sprayed if you were going out on a date, but this can be worn anytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: This perfume smells great and if you love the other Britney Spears perfume, this is a must have also!</li>
            <li> Love the smell, as does my girlfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know what you are thinking.... how on earth could a perfume backed by Brittany spears smell good?&lt;br /&gt;Well it does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me: 37&lt;br /&gt;GF: 27&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We both love it (on her of course).</li>
            <li> I am really happy I could buy such a good-sized bottle of one my favorite perfumes inexpensively. At department stores, I would pay $30.00 and up, so I was Really happy to buy Midnight Fantasy for under $30.00:)</li>
            <li> It took forever to receive this perfume, but thats not amazons fault. It has a very sweet candy like scent, almost cotton candy and is a lil nauseating if you spray to much. I bought because some friends kept ranting about it and honestly, I do not find the smell appropriate for an almost 30 year old. It is more of a teenager scent. Still pleasant, just not for me. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> There are are excellent ..... I was a mast by the  scent ...</li>
            <li> Been wearing this perfume for two years now and im still loving it.</li>
            <li> def one of my fave perfumes. smells so amazing omg.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this perfume for 5 years now, I&#x27;m in love with it, every time I wear it, i get compliments, it&#x27;s long lasting, it smells sweet like cotton candy, and the boys go crazy when they are kissing me, it&#x27;s like a love potion.. you won&#x27;t go wrong with this, it&#x27;s beautiful..</li>
            <li> Favorite smelling perfume! Very pretty bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll say it once and all say it again..... Britney Spears makes some damn good perfume!&lt;br /&gt;This one and Circus are my two favorites! I was addicted to both.&lt;br /&gt;It even comes in a beautiful bottle!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this is you love fruity scents.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, sexy, alluring scent.  Britney has outdone herself, and if she could bring her desirability up to the level of her fragrance, she would be #1.</li>
            <li> I love love love this perfume!!! And it&#x27;s not sold very many places. Let alone in the bigger size. So long as Amazon sells it, I&#x27;ll be buying it!!!</li>
            <li> Muy rico este perfume. La entrega  perfecta, sin ningun tipo de problema. Siempre he usado esta fragancia y la recomiendo</li>
            <li> One of my colleagues wears it, which is how I learned about it. I asked her straight up what she is wearing because she smelled so good. She told me it was Midnight Fantasy by Britney Spears. I went and bought it for my girlfriend, who is also enjoying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be afraid to buy a tester version of this product. It is the exact same thing just without the box and the spherical cap.</li>
            <li> Long lasting sweet smell!</li>
            <li> Love this scent. I get complements all the time, what are you wearing.</li>
            <li> Love love love the scent...wish I could have a much bigger bottle though...really nice sweet smell...just the way I like it :) Nice Musky undertone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used her perfumes for years. This scent is sweet and fruity and has great staying power. The prices are always great and I will be buying more for years to come. One of my signature scents!!-Brisce M</li>
            <li> Always a good go to gift</li>
            <li> My daughter wears this and I find it pleasing and floral, but not to heavy. She always smells really nice but never overwhelming. I will continue to purchase this for her.</li>
            <li> Midnight Fantasy is light and yet has staying power! The scent is good for all ages and a family favorite.</li>
            <li> My favourite perfumes! Love it :))))</li>
            <li> This perfume became a staple after I first tried it some 6 years ago. It&#x27;s very light and has a touch of sweetness to it. I&#x27;ve never read the &amp;#34;notes&amp;#34; that went into making it - I just always go by the &amp;#34;I love how it smells&amp;#34; feeling, because several different perfumes might use the same ingredient in several different ways and they will have nothing in common; but I would guess vanilla in here...maybe... Or the smell is similar - you don&#x27;t eat vanilla bean, but it smells good enough to eat - here is the same: the scent is almost edible, dessert-like. It&#x27;s an everyday perfume for me - just enough to get noticed (always a lot of compliments on it), but not too much to overwhelm. Highly recommend to try it  out! I would&#x27;ve never thought I would love Britney Spears perfume (it&#x27;s a prejudice here, I know, but I feel that many stars just stamp out &amp;#34;sweet scents&amp;#34; like from a conveyor), alas it is here, on my shelf, and I always buy new one once I see that&#x27;s it&#x27;s getting low.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume and it was so much cheaper than the retail stores, thank you so much it was just what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I have read someone said it&#x27;s too sweet and i could not agree more. My first impression was it smells like vitamins? Vitamin c.. I dont know. I love sweet scents but this one is too much for me.&lt;br /&gt;But who knows, i might like this eventually.&lt;br /&gt;I might be just overwhelmed since i got all my 5 perfumes today. :))</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this perfume but ordered this for my sister as a gift. It is a nice size and arrived within a week.</li>
            <li> It is so perfect and delicious. I really love this perfum is so good. Its perfect for a date, so sexy.</li>
            <li> I dont think it&#x27;s all.that great . Everyone made it out to be so spectacular. It smells kind of like pez</li>
            <li> I wanna eat the bottle. seriously, like a gum drop in my mouth. scent is better than the original I believe. Can&#x27;t deny it&#x27;s taunting powers. Recommend!</li>
            <li> I recommend this to all my friends who love scents that stay for hours. And a scent that gets noticed instantly</li>
            <li> Fake!!!! This is not the real midnight it is fake!!!. The blue on the bottle even scratches off and I wrote them and they said it is 100% real .. I&#x27;ve used this for years and I know that&#x27;s 100% bs</li>
            <li> My second favorite Britney perfume (only second to Curious: In Control) and I will continue to buy this as long as it&#x27;s available. Every time I wear this I am told how nice and refreshing I smell. The scent lasts all day and is reminiscent of fruit loops (it&#x27;s not weird, it&#x27;s wonderful). If your skeptical, head to a mall or local Sephora location and try it out - it&#x27;s definitely worth trying!</li>
            <li> I loved it and thanks so much because you made my purchase a really good purchase and a amazing item like this I&#x27;m excited</li>
            <li> lets start by saying i do not like britney spears nor her music. But i didn&#x27;t have my glasses on one time at walgreene and i was testinh some perfume and this smelt realy good and sweet. so i bought it. it was 2 scents in one, When i got home i was putting my glasses on and seen it was her perfume but it smells so good. So when i was getting low on it i found it here and i got it. It really smells nice. Like blueberries and bubble gum.</li>
            <li> Smells great &amp; lasts a fair amount of time (I&#x27;d say a few hours for a couple light spritzes). The smell is definitely on the fruity side and has a blueberry undertone to it. However, it is a deeper/more mature scent than the regular (pink bottle) Fantasy perfume.</li>
            <li> Great product and shipped quick!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this! Its so mysterious! I definitely use this for a night on the town and its amazing. Brit really hit it on this one! This is probably my most favored perfume from Britney! Its s sultry scent mixed with some fruity tones! i love how it doesnt smell cheap at all! And a great price for sure (:</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product came on time and price for the size it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Order came swiftly. Scent was awesome. Very suitable for many occasions and it is very long lasting too. It lasted more than 8 hours on me. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I use to but this perfume in a generic brand and I absolutely loved it! I ordered this as soon as I saw it! It came in the purple box it shows. The box is really shiny!!!!! The perfume smells amazing! Very cute clean smell.</li>
