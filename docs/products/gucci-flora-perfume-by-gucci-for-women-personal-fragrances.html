            <li>I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>and i absolutely love it</li>

            <li>This perfume really smells great.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume.</li>
            <li>I thoroughly enjoyed getting to try out Flora by Gucci Campaign.  </li>
            <li>I received many compliments and questions about what I was wearing.</li>
            <li>This is a really elegant scent.</li>
            <li>Top of my list up there with almost Chance by Chanel.  </li>
            <li>i am glad it arrived on time.</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful and a couple sprays last through most of the day.</li>
            <li>I love the lotion too, and it&#x27;s affordable too!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but it says that I have to write more</li>
            <li>And the liquid has many IMPURITIES.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price!!</li>
            <li>If you love smelling sexy yet clean and elegant, I would reccommend that you buy this product.</li>
            <li>this smells fantastic on Her, glad I ordered it.</li>
            <li>Everything was so easy, ordering shipping and getting the product.  </li>
            <li>Has a pleasent but not too strong odor.</li>
            <li>I also have the eau fraiche which is clean and fresh and love that too!</li>
            <li>Lovely smelling fresh perfume at a fantastic price</li>
            <li>I received samples and coupons as a BzzAgent which allowed me to thoroughly and accurately review this</li>
            <li>This is a very nice floral-citrus perfume with moderate staying power.</li>
            <li>I ran out of the original one I had bought and repurchased this one.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Excellent perfume......not too strong but strong enough to hold on for several hours.  </li>
            <li>there&#x27;s nothing really special or unique about it.</li>
            <li>I would most certainly (&amp; probably will) buy again.</li>
            <li>Well kinda isn&#x27;t good enough.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking for sweet n yummy.</li>
            <li>the scent must be potent enough that when you walk by someone they can pleasantly enjoy the aroma, but not so overwhelming that it creates nausea or headaches.</li>
            <li>It is not overpowering or too sweet in the way that some floral fragrances are.</li>
            <li>Its new and refreshing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a mature woman&#x27;s perfume.</li>
            <li>Such a nice sensual scent now a fav and signature scent.</li>
            <li>It is a classy sophisticated scent.</li>
            <li>Although I still love Chanel, princess and juicy couture as soft inoffensive scents.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to certain smells; I get nausea, dizziness and headaches very easily, so that is why I am picky in what I wear.</li>
            <li>Also, I used to love gucci rush for a good long lasting chypre, and still have it on my dresser if needed.</li>
            <li>it will be a right choice..</li>
            <li>First I tried Flora Fraiche, you can spray till the cows come home and it stays soft and sexy.  </li>
            <li>Gucci is one of my favorite brands of cologne, this particular item has a really fresh soft fragrance</li>
            <li>Product was very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s your basic safe, run-of-the-mill perfume you buy at the mall.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying some more of it.</li>
            <li>Its lightly floral and never heavy smelling.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I bought it</li>
            <li>Package came next day, no complaints :)</li>
            <li>The top of the box is torn open.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really a good everyday scent</li>
            <li>It smells pretty much like musk, powder, and sandalwood.</li>
            <li>I believe scent triggers certain memories and helps us retain those memories as well.</li>
            <li>very unique..it stays on the clothes too..</li>
            <li>Personally, I&#x27;m very picky with smells.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do identify specific attributes (e.g. comfort &amp; fit of a shirt or the battery life of a camera) and whether they met your expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Very wearable day or night.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I like it so much</li>
            <li>you Do explain why you liked or disliked this</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong, but not loudly mind you.</li>
            <li>but definitely nothing special.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong at first, not sweet at all.</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance and it was much less than the department store and because I have Amazon Prime</li>
            <li>Even after a 10 hour work day, and an hour work out each time, by the end of the day, the scent still lingered on me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend the Flora by Gucci collection, to anyone that loves to feel feminine and serene, without overpowering scents.</li>
            <li>I have the new Gucci for women in the brown bottle.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and came with samples and coupons for other perfumes.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at the results.</li>
            <li>Not cloying not old lady like, modern and for all girls alike!  </li>
            <li>It moisturizes in the winter and smells like money (classy).  </li>
            <li>I got these for my wife and all I can said is wow.</li>
            <li>sexy,light enough but with  strong notes and dry down</li>
            <li>Every time I moved, I could smell the delicateness of these perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;The real test would be how long the scent would last.</li>
            <li>Has a funny sour smell.</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s going to take a little while before i can try the newest 2012 florals, so they will have to wait for right now.</li>
            <li>its long lasting fragrance,strong,feels very suitable for cold weather..</li>

            <li> its long lasting fragrance,strong,feels very suitable for cold weather..</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;Do compare to similar products and share how long you&#x27;ve used this</li>
            <li> And lastly, a scent must be long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this is some cheap knock-off.</li>
            <li> lasts long...</li>
            <li> its a strange mix of flowers..</li>
            <li> and it stays for a long time you can smell it and</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just a little lighter but the same fragrance as the edp.</li>
            <li> When choosing a scent I look for a few two key elements...</li>
            <li> After my shower I would carefully put the perfume on, and then would proceed with my work day.</li>
            <li> The one i got has a pink string and its glass body is not smooth as the other Gucci Floras i have bought from store.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell anything like it and frankly, has a sour smell to it.</li>
            <li> It is not particularly sexy or heavy, but isn&#x27;t to floral either.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> FAKE GUCCI SHOULD NOT BE SOLD ON THIS WEBSITE ESPECIALLY IF IT CANNOT BE RETURNED!!!!</li>
            <li> Next I will try Guilty.  </li>
            <li> I spritzed my sample on at least 8 hours ago</li>
            <li> do feel like the scent doesn&#x27;t stay on all day, or it loses its potency and becomes really subtle.</li>
            <li> I just spent my money on something that smells bad</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money like I did. :(</li>
            <li> But not as expensive.  </li>
            <li> The item i received is FAKE!</li>
            <li> Very disappointment.</li>

            <li> need i say more? gucci..............bought this on a whim for the wife and it is absolutely great! the fruity fragrance lasts all day. Not dissapointed at all smells great lasts long...a 10 out of 10 dont be scared to purchase this if you have never tried it!</li>
            <li> this is an amazing perfume,  I was wearing it and i&#x27;m planning to purchase it again..its long lasting fragrance,strong,feels very suitable for cold weather..its a strange mix of flowers..yummy..very unique..it stays on the clothes too..don&#x27;t hesitate..it will be a right choice..</li>
            <li> I had order this for my friend&#x27;s birthday - Never received it and didn&#x27;t even get a reply from the vendor when I inquired.  Very disappointment.</li>
            <li> Thought I wanted it since I had the sample and kinda liked it. Well kinda isn&#x27;t good enough. It&#x27;s strong at first, not sweet at all. It&#x27;s not horrible. I gave it to my mom. It&#x27;s more of a mature woman&#x27;s perfume. I&#x27;m looking for sweet n yummy. I&#x27;m gonna stick with couture couture by Juicy.</li>
            <li> Personally, I&#x27;m very picky with smells. I went to bloomingdales and basically tried the entire fragrance section until I found this scent. I LOVE it. Its new and refreshing.</li>
            <li> Product was very reasonably priced. It was sent quickly and in perfect condition. It will make a nice gift. Thank you</li>
            <li> The item i received is FAKE! i tried to send it back and AMAZON is not letting me! I want to return this and get my MONEY BACK! FAKE GUCCI SHOULD NOT BE SOLD ON THIS WEBSITE ESPECIALLY IF IT CANNOT BE RETURNED!!!!</li>
            <li> love it! Such a nice sensual scent now a fav and signature scent. sexy,light enough but with  strong notes and dry down which also helps it to last. I love the peony and omanthumus and with the lotion it is the bomb dellio! Not overpowering at all and i do like the edp, which is good for nights out or church on sunday but decided to try the edt and it&#x27;s really a good everyday scent and i absolutely love it, it&#x27;s just a little lighter but the same fragrance as the edp. It&#x27;s awesome with the layering of shower gel,lotion and edt. I also have the eau fraiche which is clean and fresh and love that too! all three have their place. Now it&#x27;s going to take a little while before i can try the newest 2012 florals, so they will have to wait for right now. Too many scents from one company that have to be conquered, so I&#x27;ll just continue to enjoy my three floras!!! Also, I used to love gucci rush for a good long lasting chypre, and still have it on my dresser if needed.</li>
            <li> No . The fragrance was not the same as store bought. . I would not recommend.! I would think twice before purchasing.</li>
            <li> Why is this named Flora? It smells pretty much like musk, powder, and sandalwood. There is a sweetness but it&#x27;s more something resembling vanilla, almonds maybe, or sweetened condensed milk. Definitely something gourmand rather than flowers. I agree with  the reviewers that say it&#x27;s not an offensive smell but definitely nothing special. It&#x27;s your basic safe, run-of-the-mill perfume you buy at the mall. One good thing for those that like this fragrance, it does have staying power. I spritzed my sample on at least 8 hours ago and it&#x27;s still going strong, but not loudly mind you.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice floral-citrus perfume with moderate staying power. It smells very generic to me, though...there&#x27;s nothing really special or unique about it. I suggest finding something else.</li>
            <li> This is the best fragrance I have ever smelt. I can not stop smelling it. I will definitely be buying some more of it. If you love smelling sexy yet clean and elegant, I would reccommend that you buy this product. It&#x27;s worth the price!!</li>
            <li> The bottle that I received contained a perfume, but it is not Gucci Flora. It doesn&#x27;t smell anything like it and frankly, has a sour smell to it. All I wear is Gucci Flora and this is definitely not it. To add insult to injury, you cannot return this perfume once it has been shipped to you. I just spent my money on something that smells bad and I&#x27;ll never wear. BUYER BEWARE.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. Received it so quickly and great for the price. I ran out of the original one I had bought and repurchased this one. Love it!</li>
            <li> Gucci is one of my favorite brands of cologne, this particular item has a really fresh soft fragrance and I receive tons of compliments whenever I wear it, especially from the guys.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item and was not disappointed. I love the fragrance and it was much less than the department store and because I have Amazon Prime, I received it next day. Great.</li>
            <li> Love love love this.  Its lightly floral and never heavy smelling.  This is the first time I bought it and it was recommended to be by my sister who also loves it.  I will buy it again!!!!</li>
            <li> Everything was so easy, ordering shipping and getting the product.  The perfume came in a great packaging display and of course my wife loved the Flora Flora</li>
            <li> This perfume really smells great. I would definitely recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> Lovely smelling fresh perfume at a fantastic price</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. I got a sample of it with a sephora purchase and couldnt wait to buy it. Package came next day, no complaints :)</li>

            <li> Got this for my daughter as ladt minute christmas gift. She looked it. It is a classy sophisticated scent.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. It smells great. You can&#x27;t beat the price for the size of bottle. I&#x27;m a happy girl.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that I received this product as part of the Flora by Gucci Bzz Campaign. I received samples and coupons as a BzzAgent which allowed me to thoroughly and accurately review this product.&lt;br /&gt; I am someone who loves scent. I believe scent triggers certain memories and helps us retain those memories as well. I thoroughly enjoyed getting to try out Flora by Gucci Campaign.  When choosing a scent I look for a few two key elements...the scent must be potent enough that when you walk by someone they can pleasantly enjoy the aroma, but not so overwhelming that it creates nausea or headaches. And lastly, a scent must be long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;I found my requirements to be met with the Flora by Gucci collection. After my shower I would carefully put the perfume on, and then would proceed with my work day. I received many compliments and questions about what I was wearing. I am sensitive to certain smells; I get nausea, dizziness and headaches very easily, so that is why I am picky in what I wear. I had no issues with this collection. Every time I moved, I could smell the delicateness of these perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;The real test would be how long the scent would last. I was pleasantly surprised at the results. Even after a 10 hour work day, and an hour work out each time, by the end of the day, the scent still lingered on me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend the Flora by Gucci collection, to anyone that loves to feel feminine and serene, without overpowering scents.</li>
            <li> This is a really elegant scent. It is not particularly sexy or heavy, but isn&#x27;t to floral either.&lt;br /&gt;Its a good mix of musk and floral. Very wearable day or night.&lt;br /&gt;I do feel like the scent doesn&#x27;t stay on all day, or it loses its potency and becomes really subtle.</li>
            <li> First I tried Flora Fraiche, you can spray till the cows come home and it stays soft and sexy.  Not cloying not old lady like, modern and for all girls alike!  Top of my list up there with almost Chance by Chanel.  But not as expensive.  I am trying the regular Flora EDT.  I find that the perfume versions of a scent smell much different than the EDT.  Next I will try Guilty.  I have the new Gucci for women in the brown bottle. Gave that to my niece and that brand of body lotion is GREAT!!!!! It moisturizes in the winter and smells like money (classy).  I have discovered Gucci in a big way. Although I still love Chanel, princess and juicy couture as soft inoffensive scents.</li>
            <li> I own this one myself. It is a Christmas gift for my Mom as well. i am glad it arrived on time.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderfully feminine, crisp floral...but light scent. It is not overpowering or too sweet in the way that some floral fragrances are. I love it! it is my signature scent.</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for my mother &amp; now I wish I had gotten 2! Smells wonderful and a couple sprays last through most of the day. Shipped quickly and came with samples and coupons for other perfumes. Great purchase. I would most certainly (&amp; probably will) buy again.</li>
            <li> The top of the box is torn open. The lining has stripes that were ripped out, so the white paper is showing in places. There is no way to return this item. I had to ask my credit-card company to contact Amazon, who promised to refund the purchase.</li>
            <li> I got these for my wife and all I can said is wow. It smell so nice that now she said to me to make sure I don&#x27;t let it finish</li>
            <li> this smells fantastic on Her, glad I ordered it. Has a pleasent but not too strong odor. I do recommend it.</li>
            <li> A great perfume. Persistent floral aroma. There is not any complaints.</li>
            <li> Great smelling perfume, one of my favorites!!! I love the lotion too, and it&#x27;s affordable too!&lt;br /&gt;I am done reviewing this lol but it says that I have to write more ok I can stop now!</li>
            <li> I have been waiting to get this perfume for a while. Unfortunately this is some cheap knock-off. Has a funny sour smell. Don&#x27;t waste your money like I did. :(</li>
            <li> i can say its more than amazing product.I like it so much and it stays for a long time you can smell it and people notice the wonderful smell.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with fragrance.  Great packaging for shipping.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> The product is not the one in the pic. The one i got has a pink string and its glass body is not smooth as the other Gucci Floras i have bought from store. And the liquid has many IMPURITIES.</li>
            <li> Excellent perfume......not too strong but strong enough to hold on for several hours.  Got lots of compliments!</li>
