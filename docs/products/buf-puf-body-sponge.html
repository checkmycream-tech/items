            <li>I cant even use that on my body because it doesnt feel good.</li>
            <li>He thinks I&#x27;m just exceptional like that.</li>

            <li>They&#x27;re good quality &amp; seem to be the original product.  </li>
            <li>Use with a nice liquid soap  and your skin will look healthy and feel fantastic!  </li>

            <li>This Buf-Puf is just ok.  </li>
            <li>I have had better exfoliator pads.  </li>
            <li>My favorite go-to exfoliator for years.....</li>
            <li>My husband and I love the Buf-Puf.</li>
            <li>I purchased this 6 pack because it was a better buy than ordering them 2 at a time from [...].  </li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>Plan to purchase more when needed.  </li>
            <li>Much better than others</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried cheaper copies but always love these.  </li>
            <li>better than a washcloth.</li>
            <li>Have used this product for years and love it.</li>
            <li>I love to use them and am glad I found them here.</li>
            <li>My favorite.</li>
            <li>I started using these many years ago in my teens and have had great results with the gentle exfoliation these provide.  </li>
            <li>I love benefits of using these sponges.</li>
            <li>Excellent price, especially for a 6 pack!!!  </li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>I LOVE these &amp;#34;sponges&amp;#34; and have used them longer than I can recall.  </li>
            <li>, it is the best way to get to those hard-to-each areas of one&#x27;s back.  </li>
            <li>but I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>I love this, I&#x27;ve been using this for years</li>
            <li>The sponge will not have elasticity (more like a flattened pancake) and the fibers will seem knotted in appearance.  </li>
            <li>Follow up with your favorite moisturizer and in about a week your skin will start feeling like velvet.  </li>
            <li>This makes adhesion a sure thing.</li>
            <li>It is ideal to scrub one&#x27;s own back</li>
            <li>This sponge is my favorite</li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>I love that it can be tossed in the washer.  </li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel refreshing.</li>
            <li>Love these puffs.</li>
            <li>Will love and use these for life.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>so I love it.</li>
            <li>so glad I can still find these</li>
            <li>They are WAAAAY better than those poofy things that fall apart after 2 uses.  </li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more of these.  </li>
            <li>Started using it 3 weeks ago and am in love.</li>
            <li>My local drugstores don&#x27;t carry this product so very happy to find on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found them again, as I can&#x27;t find this in stores.</li>
            <li>IMO the white side is best for your body scrubbing.</li>
            <li>many women my age have.</li>
            <li>Love these, cant get softer skin without it.</li>
            <li>Fantastic body sponges!</li>
            <li>I love this product and would recommend it to anyone.  </li>
            <li>It does hold soap better than a washcloth</li>
            <li>I am glad I came across them again.</li>
            <li>so I was glad to find online eventually.</li>
            <li>Nice to have the multi pac available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Love this sponge.  </li>
            <li>Love these body sponges.</li>
            <li>I love the way my skin feels when I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li>and I like the option of being able to buy the 6 pack on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>They are great for exfoliating and a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>looking forward too buy more as soon as it runs out.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m so glad to find them on line.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Glad to find them again.</li>
            <li>Always love it.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>Better than a wash cloth.  </li>
            <li>I love my 2 sided buff puffs and so do my girls on both face and body.</li>
            <li>and I love them.  </li>
            <li>I love buying in these packages of 6...</li>
            <li>Get this original!</li>
            <li>Love these glad they are available on amazon</li>
            <li>I have a stoma and these have been the most efficient and most precise pads for cleaning the skin onto which the appliance is to be adhered.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels simply fantastic after cleansing and my skin absorbs my lotion much better since using the double-sided sponge.  </li>
            <li>I now understand how women are able to bear the pain of childbirth, if they enjoy the feel of this sponge.  </li>
            <li>They are also excellent for rough patches on elbows and heels.</li>
            <li>But, they make the rest of me soft and they are great at exfoliating.  </li>
            <li>They are easily disposable after 4-6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just better than anhing for making your skin clean.</li>
            <li>Keeps you clean, defoliated and smooth!</li>
            <li>They tend to go &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; after a month or so but packs of 6 are an easy solution.</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and mostly blemish free, from my head to my toes.  </li>
            <li>course I am paying more for these sponges, but they do not soften as quickly as the bargain brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The blue side is primarily for the feet (it&#x27;s a bit rougher) and does a great job of exfoliating them as well.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product.</li>
            <li>If you want really smooth skin, this is the product to use.  </li>
            <li>These fit the handles that they used to sell</li>
            <li>and my skin feels smooth at the elbows, knees, and heals without being overly abrated.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your skin silky smooth by exfoliating.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t understand why it ceased to be available in retail shops.  </li>
            <li>I wish they were a tad larger, but these sponges are great.</li>
            <li>Feels great on my back, scrubs away stress.</li>
            <li>I have always used them, they exfoliate the skin and leaves it smooth.</li>
            <li>Great back scrubber.</li>
            <li>They definitely get me clean and my skin feels great.</li>
            <li>Great for problematic skin as well as keeping skin of any age looking younger and feeling clean.</li>
            <li>It makes skin smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li>Skin feels smooth and clean after use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a new one about every eight weeks for many, many years.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>This 6-pack is at a great price and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I originally bought these for my wife as an impromptu, informal gift.  </li>
            <li>I used these when they first came out, many years ago.&lt;br /&gt;Stumbled</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t shower with a Buf-Puf, I don&#x27;t feel like I am as clean as I could be.  </li>
            <li>I can fold  them over and clean my ears easier also.  </li>
            <li>and I feel really clean after the shower.  </li>
            <li>when I travel and don&#x27;t have my Buf Puf, I can&#x27;t wait to get to my shower for that clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>love these body sponges they are great for showering and removing dead skin cells got them in a timely manner</li>
            <li>Leaves you feeling clean and well scrubbed.  </li>
            <li>Tried dry buffing, and that is great, but I wanted something to use in the shower.</li>
            <li>You wanna feel  really clean after your shower?  </li>
            <li>and you know you are getting clean with them, plus</li>
            <li>So much better than those large bath poofs.</li>
            <li>My skin stays smooth and I always feel so fresh and clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>Have loved Buff Puffs since back in the day!</li>
            <li>Good facial / body scrubbing product.</li>
            <li>this is a true factor in my purchase.</li>
            <li>B00127S53E Nivea For Men, Cool, Hair and  Body Wash, 16.9-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 3)]], using just a dab.</li>
            <li>The blue side is good for rubbing your feet for calluses but thats about it.</li>
            <li>It has great scrubbing power on one side and a more gentle scrub on the other.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my skin free of bumps and thus have very smooth skin (I&#x27;m 70 years old).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a must have to purchase the single handle that comes with its own body sponge too!</li>
            <li>They really exfoliate the skin and body getting it very clean.</li>
            <li>But the best part is getting rid of any bumps on my skin, especially the backs of the upper arms.  </li>
            <li>I love the texture because it lightly scrubs and leaves your skin soft.  </li>
            <li>If you like to really exfoliate every dead skin cell off of you this is perfect!</li>
            <li>still pretty good but not the same.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using a buf-puf product, and I can defintely understand how people have gotten hooked on them!</li>
            <li>My skin is very smooth and soft now.  </li>
            <li>The more energetic scrubs impact peripheral circulation; great for older folks with more sensitive skin and decreased circulation efficiency.  </li>
            <li>, I was at first, if you make plenty of suds on the Puf and don&#x27;t scrub like your trying to clean greasy dishes</li>
            <li>Have used this product for years and still love it - would highly recommend this item for anyone that wants a truly clean feeling.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin, and these, along with Dove unscented, keep my skin in really good shape.</li>
            <li>Unlike some loofa pads, they wear softer with age which allows for gentle (new) and more energetic (older) pad scrubs.  </li>
            <li>Gets rid of dead skin and makes your skin feel great.</li>
            <li>I have young adult kids with back acne and these work beautifully!</li>
            <li>Pricey, but worth it.  </li>
            <li>I love how soft my skin feels after a shower when I use it.</li>
            <li>Naturally, I was pleased to find these.</li>
            <li>Like the experience of others, this product keeps my extremely dry skin in pretty good shape.  </li>
            <li>Love this item and it hangs easily in my shower when attached to the long, hooked handle (sold separately).</li>
            <li>but would be much more user friendly if they were larger.</li>
            <li>I love it and a shower isn&#x27;t the same without it because I don&#x27;t feel clean.  </li>
            <li>The whole family uses these to bathe with, they invigorate the skin and you feel fresh and clean after using them.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years, and having recently moved to New Zealand, found that the local chains did not stock this superb product.</li>
            <li>Prevents all sorts of skin issues and insures I really do get clean when I wash.</li>
            <li>These pads are great for shower use daily to  promote great skin by scrubbing of the dead  cells we produce daily.</li>
            <li>Anyway, even using these sponges alone, they are wonderful with the one side for more fragile skin and the other side for rougher-skin areas such as knees, elbows, etc.  </li>
            <li>these are great for putting a little bit of body wash or soap on, lathering up, and really giving your body a scrub.  </li>
            <li>In addition, an earlier reviewer stated that they were great to use prior to applying a self tanner.  </li>
            <li>Also, they&#x27;re small and easy to rinse/keep clean for more use.</li>
            <li>Initially, I was able to purchase the sponges across the counter with no problem, but lately no sponges have been available.  </li>
            <li>I like these sponges very much.  </li>
            <li>I think this Body Buf-Puf is a little bit larger than what I remember buying at the drugstores but still does a great job of scrubbing and making you feel really fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Great value on a hard to find item.</li>
            <li>Well, first of all I was under the impression that I was getting a pack of six.  </li>
            <li>They would be more utilitarian if they were a bit larger.</li>
            <li>I use this product to shower everyday.they stopped selling it in stores and was very upset till I found it on Amazon!</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin soft &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s very efficient!</li>
            <li>The one and only Buf-Puf has many imitators but none measure up in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Even on the gentle side, I felt like I was using a brillo pad on my skin!</li>
            <li>I have used Body Buf since it first came out and just can&#x27;t use anything else.  </li>
            <li>My second order on these, I love them.</li>
            <li>I only bought this because amazon is no longer carrying my favorite , Aquasentials Dual Texture Bath Sponge (Twin Pack).</li>
            <li>The overall scrub effect from the buf-puf sponge feels like it is doing a better job</li>
            <li>Use them for years - love the feel when I scrub my back.  </li>
            <li>Love using this to scrub my back.  </li>
            <li>All  is well now as I finally got my package :)</li>
            <li>These things really work!  </li>
            <li>Love the texture definitely exfoliates my skin.</li>
            <li>As with the Buf-Puf facial sponge, I love this product.</li>
            <li>Your skin will love you for it, especially years from now.</li>
            <li>W as exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>They work great and last a long time!</li>
            <li>I will certainly be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>The sponge has two abrasive sides  - one mildly abrasive and the other a bit more abrasive.  </li>
            <li>It does a fantastic job on your back (use the green side) and for a light buf the white side is great on the rest of your body.   </li>
            <li>It really keeps your skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It definitely does a great job taking all the rough patches around my chin area off and smoothing them out.</li>
            <li>The darker green side is perfect for rough elbows or knees.</li>
            <li>OK, I know this has nothing to do with much of anything, just wanted to share my deep appreciation of this underrated product.     </li>
            <li>so long can&#x27;t remember exactly how many.  </li>
            <li>I love the whole Buf-Puf line and my local stores don&#x27;t carry these anymore.  </li>
            <li>Found these a long time ago, and on another site, more expense than Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It helped to exfoliate my skin and left it looking clean, buff, and fresh.  </li>
            <li>Have been using these for years and my skin is always soft and smooth - even for an older chick.</li>
            <li>keeps my skin looking fresh and new.</li>
            <li>Makes it easy to reach my back.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to use with liquid soaps, which can be expensive, and it doesn&#x27;t take much soap for a full body scrub.  </li>
            <li>At my age, I do not have any fine lines or wrinkles, and I believe it to the Buf-Puf pad daily usage.</li>
            <li>Remove the outer layer(s) of dead dry skin and you reveal fresher skin that can absorb moisturizer more effectively.</li>
            <li>Only available on-line these days.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable which is why I purchased them.</li>
            <li>thank you for selling them bulk at  a reasonable price(and fast delivery).</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t understand why they aren&#x27;t hanging in every drug and discount store.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these!</li>
            <li>one side is smooth and the blue side is a bit firmer...</li>
            <li>These pads really help renew my skin.  </li>
            <li>If you have tender skin use a light touch and the white side.  </li>
            <li>This baby does a great job between my toes, behind ears, under arms, around my neck, shoulders, chest, hips, elbows, knees, arms, legs, feet and between my toes.  </li>
            <li>The sponge cleans really well and does not irritate the skin.</li>
            <li>Over time I have gotten more used to it, yet it remains a bit too rough for me.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really do what i thougth</li>
            <li>They work really well and&lt;</li>
            <li>The exfoliating side is still \\&quot;soft\\&quot;, but it may be much for a person whose skin cannot handle that.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find these in any of the stores, so I really missed them.</li>
            <li>works well and exfoliation is very thorough.</li>
            <li>Was thrilled to get this box of 6 a few weeks ago, and when I received it, I reluctantly gave have one to each of my daughters</li>
            <li>Not a single pimple and nearly no wrinkles, which for my age is amazing.</li>
            <li>I have always loved these for keeping dry skin at bay in winter and for prepping skin for lotions &amp; potions all year long.</li>
            <li>you are new to this, it will feel too scratchy for some of you at first</li>
            <li>They rinse easily and dry fast</li>
            <li>the softer side works for most of the body, and the rougher spot for the bottom of the feet and other tougher spots.</li>
            <li>These sponges hold up better than other brands we have tried.</li>
            <li>I usually use for many months and then discard, but can&#x27;t wait to try some tips I learned here about washing to &amp;#34;re-puf&amp;#34; them!</li>
            <li>These simple oval sponges with a rough and very rough side, make exfoliating way more easy with silky smooth results.</li>
            <li>deep clean my skin</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve outgrown that teen phase, they still make my skin feel truly clean.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like I can get clean enough without</li>
            <li>Probably a bit coarse for some folks, but this is the only pad I have found that is suitable for all scrubbing.  </li>
            <li>then you will get used to it and think there&#x27;s no way a regular washcloth can clean as well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So durable we use them in the shower until they get too &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; and then we use them outside for scrubbing garden stuff clean.</li>
            <li>Since it was pre-internet days, I wrote the company a long letter telling them my dilemma, and within weeks I received a huge box full of all sorts of different sizes of Buff Puffs.</li>
            <li>Good product, although my husband wishes they were just a little larger.</li>
            <li>They are really hard to find in the local stores anymore, so I am  happy that Amazon continues to sell them.  </li>
            <li>I have used these scrubs for a very long time, when they  were readily available at every drugstore in town.  </li>
            <li>Although the box says to use a sponge for only a few months, (a sales gimmick I am sure) we clean ours well</li>
            <li>Exfoliates much better than your typical mesh loofah.</li>
            <li>They hold more soap and water than a loofah, so that you use less soap as well.  </li>
            <li>They had become increasingly difficult to find in my local stores, so I was very happy to find them in a multi-pack on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Try it with the back scrub, your back will love you for it.  </li>
            <li>the rough side is great for exfoliating/removing dead or flakey skin.</li>
            <li>There is nothing better to exfoliate your skin which would be the blue side or your face which would be the white side.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have used Buf Puf since high school (I am now in my 50&#x27;s) and I always get compliments on the smoothness of my skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>As a previous poster mentioned, the size of these sponges is specific to the handles sold by Buf-Puf which are great for scrubbing back, etc.</li>
            <li>But if your looking for something a little more luxurious and pleasurable</li>
            <li>I love how it can exfoliate like a loofah, but is flexible like a washcloth to clean small body areas, such as ears and in between toes.</li>
            <li>The soft side of this puf gently cleans tender areas (face/throat).  </li>
            <li>They last forever, I got a year out of the last 6 pack, throw them in the laundry with a load, they come out just fine.</li>
            <li>It also stimulates your body to make new layers to replace those removed.  </li>
            <li>These pads last for a long time, and they leave your skin squeaky clean!</li>
            <li>Much too rough to be useful for me.</li>
            <li>They exfoliate well and dry quickly</li>
            <li>The white side works well while soaping the whole body (gently on the face) and while washing yourself you can exfoliate.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I feel that my skin has been less prone to acne (which I used to get on my back) as the result of using these sponges with a good bath gel like [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I use these in the shower in place of wash cloths, the white side to buff my face and the blue side to smooth elbows and legs.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin very soft and feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li>The only negative is that the size has gotten smaller, but they still do a great job.</li>
            <li>the past, I have ordered from another website so I was glad to get these on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know why some reviewers complain about the thickness, these are the same exact size they&#x27;ve always been.</li>
            <li>The condition of my skin is great because I use this regularly and have for 25 years (at least the regular Buf-Puf!!).  </li>
            <li>Like many of the other reviewers, I&#x27;ve been using the Double sided body sponge for 20 years.  </li>
            <li>Scrub lightly, don&#x27;t scrub &amp;#34;your skin off.&amp;#34;  Wish Buf Puf would re-issue their long handled back brushes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other \\&quot;scrubbies\\&quot; and products but nothing comes close to the clean and smooth this little beauty gives me.  </li>
            <li>I buy them in large packages, use them regularly and give them to friends.</li>
            <li>I am usually covered in dust and mud on a daily basis from our trips to the park and this little miracle scrubs it all away beautifully plus leaves my skin amazingly soft.  </li>
            <li>I was afraid I would never find them again, and was so happy to find them on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The harder side is fantastic for feet and back and the rest of your body.  </li>
            <li>These double sided sponges, blue slighly rougher than white has kept my entire body from my heels to elbows, and face as well, very well exfoliated, invigorated and smooth.  </li>
            <li>The white end gently exfoliates tender skin ...</li>
            <li>these sponges can be used to replace the old sponges</li>
            <li>I found the poufs to be a mystery when they needed to be replaced unless they were completely falling apart.  </li>
            <li>They do exfoliate but not real deeply, they dissolve before they can really work.</li>
            <li>Works well to exfoliate dead skin cells and leaves skin smooth.  </li>
            <li>The pads are invigorating, but not harsh.  </li>
            <li>So by the time I finish the whole pack, I may not have any skin left</li>
            <li>I have been using Buf-Puf since I was 18 yrs old....</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I am chemically sensitive so can&#x27;t use lotions, etc.</li>
            <li>The two sides for the different areas of the skin were very helpful as well.  </li>
            <li>Can understand being sensitive</li>
            <li>I dont even have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It lasts pretty long, but I change once a month for sanitary reasons.</li>
            <li>I am 64 years old and have been using these since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li>My 2 children also love these sponges, and whenever they come home take a few back with them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve thrown in wash with towels and let air dry, which I like very much. .</li>
            <li>I exfoliate my skin everyday and feel extra clean!</li>
            <li>I started using these pads in Iraq in 2006 - they work a lot better than a washcloth for sloughing off dead skin cells, grime and the sweat of a long day in hell.</li>
            <li>but in my opinion it is too small to be held comfortably in the hand.  </li>
            <li>Im not sure you will enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>exactly what I expected them to be</li>
            <li>Plus, they way out last other similar sponges, more than making up for the extra cost.</li>
            <li>They may seem rough at first, and i wouldn&#x27;t use it on my face, ever.  </li>
            <li>I am in my 50&#x27;s and can tell you that I use the blue side on my face to remove dead skin and fine lines.</li>
            <li>i wanted more of a tough scrubber then a soft sponge and this wasn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li>I just recently ordered me some more so that I can use them on my back (since I have a little back acne) to see if it will help clear up my bacne.</li>
            <li>No need for one of those new facial twirly scrubbers.  </li>
            <li>I have used Buf-Puf Facial Sponge for a long time but this is my first purchase of the body sponge.</li>
            <li>and I can actually wash my whole back</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin soft, sloughing old skin on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>My wife likes these so much every year I order enough to last her a year</li>
            <li>Leaving a one star because the description clearly says &amp;#34;Pack of 6&amp;#34; yet I got ONLY ONE—for over $20?—in my delivery!!</li>
            <li>This one is a tad rough even on the gentle side.  </li>
            <li>this one is not the same as the old one...</li>
            <li>Years ago (back in the early 80&#x27;s), I moved from HI to NC, and could not find my buff puffs in any store.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like doing a soft facial peel all over your body..</li>
            <li>use natural hand made bar soap but have used commercial liquid body washes with it as well.  </li>
            <li>I use the white side to gently exfoliate my face and it seems to really help to get rid of dead skin.</li>
            <li>I love the scruffy side of the sponge for those extra dry areas that need a little extra buffing.  </li>
            <li>It may cost a little more than the small sponges I have bought at other stores, but these are well worth it.</li>
            <li>One side is for your face and gentle areas, the other is harsher.</li>
            <li>This sponge can help not only remove feD skin with its rough sude but gently cleanse you with a softer side.</li>
            <li>Green-side for the body, white for the neck, throat and face - might be too coarse for sensitive skin but works well otherwise.</li>
            <li>In general, I use the facial and body buff puffs as part of my skin care regimen.</li>
            <li>Now it keeps my skin soft and I don&#x27;t have the dulling dry layer</li>
            <li>If you feel that your skin is sensitive, I would recommend only using on dry areas, like foot soles or elbows.</li>

            <li> I have been using the BufPuf double-sided body sponge for years and have never found another brand that is as good as the Buf-Puf quality.  </li>

            <li> good stuff.</li>
            <li> The sponges fit the Buf-Puf handle perfectly</li>

            <li> I cant even use that on my body because it doesnt feel good.</li>
            <li> He thinks I&#x27;m just exceptional like that.</li>

            <li> They&#x27;re good quality &amp; seem to be the original product.  </li>
            <li> Use with a nice liquid soap  and your skin will look healthy and feel fantastic!  </li>

            <li> good product, arrived quickly</li>
            <li> It brings back GREAT MEMORIES!!!!!</li>
            <li> This Buf-Puf is just ok.  </li>
            <li> I have had better exfoliator pads.  </li>
            <li> My favorite go-to exfoliator for years.....</li>
            <li> My husband and I love the Buf-Puf.</li>
            <li> I purchased this 6 pack because it was a better buy than ordering them 2 at a time from [...].  </li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> Plan to purchase more when needed.  </li>
            <li> Much better than others</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried cheaper copies but always love these.  </li>
            <li> better than a washcloth.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years and love it.</li>
            <li> I love to use them and am glad I found them here.</li>
            <li> My favorite.</li>
            <li> I started using these many years ago in my teens and have had great results with the gentle exfoliation these provide.  </li>
            <li> I love benefits of using these sponges.</li>
            <li> Excellent price, especially for a 6 pack!!!  </li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these &amp;#34;sponges&amp;#34; and have used them longer than I can recall.  </li>
            <li> , it is the best way to get to those hard-to-each areas of one&#x27;s back.  </li>
            <li> but I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> I love this, I&#x27;ve been using this for years</li>
            <li> The sponge will not have elasticity (more like a flattened pancake) and the fibers will seem knotted in appearance.  </li>
            <li> Follow up with your favorite moisturizer and in about a week your skin will start feeling like velvet.  </li>
            <li> This makes adhesion a sure thing.</li>
            <li> It is ideal to scrub one&#x27;s own back</li>
            <li> This sponge is my favorite</li>
            <li> Glad</li>
            <li> I love that it can be tossed in the washer.  </li>
            <li> I really love it.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel refreshing.</li>
            <li> Love these puffs.</li>
            <li> Will love and use these for life.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> so I love it.</li>
            <li> so glad I can still find these</li>
            <li> They are WAAAAY better than those poofy things that fall apart after 2 uses.  </li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more of these.  </li>
            <li> Started using it 3 weeks ago and am in love.</li>
            <li> My local drugstores don&#x27;t carry this product so very happy to find on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found them again, as I can&#x27;t find this in stores.</li>
            <li> IMO the white side is best for your body scrubbing.</li>
            <li> many women my age have.</li>
            <li> Love these, cant get softer skin without it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic body sponges!</li>
            <li> I love this product and would recommend it to anyone.  </li>
            <li> It does hold soap better than a washcloth</li>
            <li> I am glad I came across them again.</li>
            <li> so I was glad to find online eventually.</li>
            <li> Nice to have the multi pac available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love this sponge.  </li>
            <li> Love these body sponges.</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels when I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li> and I like the option of being able to buy the 6 pack on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> They are great for exfoliating and a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> looking forward too buy more as soon as it runs out.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m so glad to find them on line.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Glad to find them again.</li>
            <li> Always love it.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> Better than a wash cloth.  </li>
            <li> I love my 2 sided buff puffs and so do my girls on both face and body.</li>
            <li> and I love them.  </li>
            <li> I love buying in these packages of 6...</li>
            <li> Get this original!</li>
            <li> Love these glad they are available on amazon</li>
            <li> I have a stoma and these have been the most efficient and most precise pads for cleaning the skin onto which the appliance is to be adhered.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels simply fantastic after cleansing and my skin absorbs my lotion much better since using the double-sided sponge.  </li>
            <li> I now understand how women are able to bear the pain of childbirth, if they enjoy the feel of this sponge.  </li>
            <li> They are also excellent for rough patches on elbows and heels.</li>
            <li> But, they make the rest of me soft and they are great at exfoliating.  </li>
            <li> They are easily disposable after 4-6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just better than anhing for making your skin clean.</li>
            <li> Keeps you clean, defoliated and smooth!</li>
            <li> They tend to go &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; after a month or so but packs of 6 are an easy solution.</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth and mostly blemish free, from my head to my toes.  </li>
            <li> course I am paying more for these sponges, but they do not soften as quickly as the bargain brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The blue side is primarily for the feet (it&#x27;s a bit rougher) and does a great job of exfoliating them as well.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product.</li>
            <li> If you want really smooth skin, this is the product to use.  </li>
            <li> These fit the handles that they used to sell</li>
            <li> and my skin feels smooth at the elbows, knees, and heals without being overly abrated.  </li>
            <li> Leaves your skin silky smooth by exfoliating.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t understand why it ceased to be available in retail shops.  </li>
            <li> I wish they were a tad larger, but these sponges are great.</li>
            <li> Feels great on my back, scrubs away stress.</li>
            <li> I have always used them, they exfoliate the skin and leaves it smooth.</li>
            <li> Great back scrubber.</li>
            <li> They definitely get me clean and my skin feels great.</li>
            <li> Great for problematic skin as well as keeping skin of any age looking younger and feeling clean.</li>
            <li> It makes skin smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li> Skin feels smooth and clean after use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a new one about every eight weeks for many, many years.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> This 6-pack is at a great price and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I originally bought these for my wife as an impromptu, informal gift.  </li>
            <li> I used these when they first came out, many years ago.&lt;br /&gt;Stumbled</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t shower with a Buf-Puf, I don&#x27;t feel like I am as clean as I could be.  </li>
            <li> I can fold  them over and clean my ears easier also.  </li>
            <li> and I feel really clean after the shower.  </li>
            <li> when I travel and don&#x27;t have my Buf Puf, I can&#x27;t wait to get to my shower for that clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> love these body sponges they are great for showering and removing dead skin cells got them in a timely manner</li>
            <li> Leaves you feeling clean and well scrubbed.  </li>
            <li> Tried dry buffing, and that is great, but I wanted something to use in the shower.</li>
            <li> You wanna feel  really clean after your shower?  </li>
            <li> and you know you are getting clean with them, plus</li>
            <li> So much better than those large bath poofs.</li>
            <li> My skin stays smooth and I always feel so fresh and clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> Have loved Buff Puffs since back in the day!</li>
            <li> Good facial / body scrubbing product.</li>
            <li> this is a true factor in my purchase.</li>
            <li> B00127S53E Nivea For Men, Cool, Hair and  Body Wash, 16.9-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 3)]], using just a dab.</li>
            <li> The blue side is good for rubbing your feet for calluses but thats about it.</li>
            <li> It has great scrubbing power on one side and a more gentle scrub on the other.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my skin free of bumps and thus have very smooth skin (I&#x27;m 70 years old).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a must have to purchase the single handle that comes with its own body sponge too!</li>
            <li> They really exfoliate the skin and body getting it very clean.</li>
            <li> But the best part is getting rid of any bumps on my skin, especially the backs of the upper arms.  </li>
            <li> I love the texture because it lightly scrubs and leaves your skin soft.  </li>
            <li> If you like to really exfoliate every dead skin cell off of you this is perfect!</li>
            <li> still pretty good but not the same.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a buf-puf product, and I can defintely understand how people have gotten hooked on them!</li>
            <li> My skin is very smooth and soft now.  </li>
            <li> The more energetic scrubs impact peripheral circulation; great for older folks with more sensitive skin and decreased circulation efficiency.  </li>
            <li> , I was at first, if you make plenty of suds on the Puf and don&#x27;t scrub like your trying to clean greasy dishes</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years and still love it - would highly recommend this item for anyone that wants a truly clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, and these, along with Dove unscented, keep my skin in really good shape.</li>
            <li> Unlike some loofa pads, they wear softer with age which allows for gentle (new) and more energetic (older) pad scrubs.  </li>
            <li> Gets rid of dead skin and makes your skin feel great.</li>
            <li> I have young adult kids with back acne and these work beautifully!</li>
            <li> Pricey, but worth it.  </li>
            <li> I love how soft my skin feels after a shower when I use it.</li>
            <li> Naturally, I was pleased to find these.</li>
            <li> Like the experience of others, this product keeps my extremely dry skin in pretty good shape.  </li>
            <li> Love this item and it hangs easily in my shower when attached to the long, hooked handle (sold separately).</li>
            <li> but would be much more user friendly if they were larger.</li>
            <li> I love it and a shower isn&#x27;t the same without it because I don&#x27;t feel clean.  </li>
            <li> The whole family uses these to bathe with, they invigorate the skin and you feel fresh and clean after using them.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, and having recently moved to New Zealand, found that the local chains did not stock this superb product.</li>
            <li> Prevents all sorts of skin issues and insures I really do get clean when I wash.</li>
            <li> These pads are great for shower use daily to  promote great skin by scrubbing of the dead  cells we produce daily.</li>
            <li> Anyway, even using these sponges alone, they are wonderful with the one side for more fragile skin and the other side for rougher-skin areas such as knees, elbows, etc.  </li>
            <li> these are great for putting a little bit of body wash or soap on, lathering up, and really giving your body a scrub.  </li>
            <li> In addition, an earlier reviewer stated that they were great to use prior to applying a self tanner.  </li>
            <li> Also, they&#x27;re small and easy to rinse/keep clean for more use.</li>
            <li> Initially, I was able to purchase the sponges across the counter with no problem, but lately no sponges have been available.  </li>
            <li> I like these sponges very much.  </li>
            <li> I think this Body Buf-Puf is a little bit larger than what I remember buying at the drugstores but still does a great job of scrubbing and making you feel really fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Great value on a hard to find item.</li>
            <li> Well, first of all I was under the impression that I was getting a pack of six.  </li>
            <li> They would be more utilitarian if they were a bit larger.</li>
            <li> I use this product to shower everyday.they stopped selling it in stores and was very upset till I found it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin soft &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s very efficient!</li>
            <li> The one and only Buf-Puf has many imitators but none measure up in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Even on the gentle side, I felt like I was using a brillo pad on my skin!</li>
            <li> I have used Body Buf since it first came out and just can&#x27;t use anything else.  </li>
            <li> My second order on these, I love them.</li>
            <li> I only bought this because amazon is no longer carrying my favorite , Aquasentials Dual Texture Bath Sponge (Twin Pack).</li>
            <li> The overall scrub effect from the buf-puf sponge feels like it is doing a better job</li>
            <li> Use them for years - love the feel when I scrub my back.  </li>
            <li> Love using this to scrub my back.  </li>
            <li> All  is well now as I finally got my package :)</li>
            <li> These things really work!  </li>
            <li> Love the texture definitely exfoliates my skin.</li>
            <li> As with the Buf-Puf facial sponge, I love this product.</li>
            <li> Your skin will love you for it, especially years from now.</li>
            <li> W as exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> They work great and last a long time!</li>
            <li> I will certainly be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> The sponge has two abrasive sides  - one mildly abrasive and the other a bit more abrasive.  </li>
            <li> It does a fantastic job on your back (use the green side) and for a light buf the white side is great on the rest of your body.   </li>
            <li> It really keeps your skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It definitely does a great job taking all the rough patches around my chin area off and smoothing them out.</li>
            <li> The darker green side is perfect for rough elbows or knees.</li>
            <li> OK, I know this has nothing to do with much of anything, just wanted to share my deep appreciation of this underrated product.     </li>
            <li> so long can&#x27;t remember exactly how many.  </li>
            <li> I love the whole Buf-Puf line and my local stores don&#x27;t carry these anymore.  </li>
            <li> Found these a long time ago, and on another site, more expense than Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It helped to exfoliate my skin and left it looking clean, buff, and fresh.  </li>
            <li> Have been using these for years and my skin is always soft and smooth - even for an older chick.</li>
            <li> keeps my skin looking fresh and new.</li>
            <li> Makes it easy to reach my back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to use with liquid soaps, which can be expensive, and it doesn&#x27;t take much soap for a full body scrub.  </li>
            <li> At my age, I do not have any fine lines or wrinkles, and I believe it to the Buf-Puf pad daily usage.</li>
            <li> Remove the outer layer(s) of dead dry skin and you reveal fresher skin that can absorb moisturizer more effectively.</li>
            <li> Only available on-line these days.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable which is why I purchased them.</li>
            <li> thank you for selling them bulk at  a reasonable price(and fast delivery).</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand why they aren&#x27;t hanging in every drug and discount store.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> one side is smooth and the blue side is a bit firmer...</li>
            <li> These pads really help renew my skin.  </li>
            <li> If you have tender skin use a light touch and the white side.  </li>
            <li> This baby does a great job between my toes, behind ears, under arms, around my neck, shoulders, chest, hips, elbows, knees, arms, legs, feet and between my toes.  </li>
            <li> The sponge cleans really well and does not irritate the skin.</li>
            <li> Over time I have gotten more used to it, yet it remains a bit too rough for me.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really do what i thougth</li>
            <li> They work really well and&lt;</li>
            <li> The exfoliating side is still \\&quot;soft\\&quot;, but it may be much for a person whose skin cannot handle that.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find these in any of the stores, so I really missed them.</li>
            <li> works well and exfoliation is very thorough.</li>
            <li> Was thrilled to get this box of 6 a few weeks ago, and when I received it, I reluctantly gave have one to each of my daughters</li>
            <li> Not a single pimple and nearly no wrinkles, which for my age is amazing.</li>
            <li> I have always loved these for keeping dry skin at bay in winter and for prepping skin for lotions &amp; potions all year long.</li>
            <li> you are new to this, it will feel too scratchy for some of you at first</li>
            <li> They rinse easily and dry fast</li>
            <li> the softer side works for most of the body, and the rougher spot for the bottom of the feet and other tougher spots.</li>
            <li> These sponges hold up better than other brands we have tried.</li>
            <li> I usually use for many months and then discard, but can&#x27;t wait to try some tips I learned here about washing to &amp;#34;re-puf&amp;#34; them!</li>
            <li> These simple oval sponges with a rough and very rough side, make exfoliating way more easy with silky smooth results.</li>
            <li> deep clean my skin</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve outgrown that teen phase, they still make my skin feel truly clean.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like I can get clean enough without</li>
            <li> Probably a bit coarse for some folks, but this is the only pad I have found that is suitable for all scrubbing.  </li>
            <li> then you will get used to it and think there&#x27;s no way a regular washcloth can clean as well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So durable we use them in the shower until they get too &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; and then we use them outside for scrubbing garden stuff clean.</li>
            <li> Since it was pre-internet days, I wrote the company a long letter telling them my dilemma, and within weeks I received a huge box full of all sorts of different sizes of Buff Puffs.</li>
            <li> Good product, although my husband wishes they were just a little larger.</li>
            <li> They are really hard to find in the local stores anymore, so I am  happy that Amazon continues to sell them.  </li>
            <li> I have used these scrubs for a very long time, when they  were readily available at every drugstore in town.  </li>
            <li> Although the box says to use a sponge for only a few months, (a sales gimmick I am sure) we clean ours well</li>
            <li> Exfoliates much better than your typical mesh loofah.</li>
            <li> They hold more soap and water than a loofah, so that you use less soap as well.  </li>
            <li> They had become increasingly difficult to find in my local stores, so I was very happy to find them in a multi-pack on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Try it with the back scrub, your back will love you for it.  </li>
            <li> the rough side is great for exfoliating/removing dead or flakey skin.</li>
            <li> There is nothing better to exfoliate your skin which would be the blue side or your face which would be the white side.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have used Buf Puf since high school (I am now in my 50&#x27;s) and I always get compliments on the smoothness of my skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> As a previous poster mentioned, the size of these sponges is specific to the handles sold by Buf-Puf which are great for scrubbing back, etc.</li>
            <li> But if your looking for something a little more luxurious and pleasurable</li>
            <li> I love how it can exfoliate like a loofah, but is flexible like a washcloth to clean small body areas, such as ears and in between toes.</li>
            <li> The soft side of this puf gently cleans tender areas (face/throat).  </li>
            <li> They last forever, I got a year out of the last 6 pack, throw them in the laundry with a load, they come out just fine.</li>
            <li> It also stimulates your body to make new layers to replace those removed.  </li>
            <li> These pads last for a long time, and they leave your skin squeaky clean!</li>
            <li> Much too rough to be useful for me.</li>
            <li> They exfoliate well and dry quickly</li>
            <li> The white side works well while soaping the whole body (gently on the face) and while washing yourself you can exfoliate.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I feel that my skin has been less prone to acne (which I used to get on my back) as the result of using these sponges with a good bath gel like [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I use these in the shower in place of wash cloths, the white side to buff my face and the blue side to smooth elbows and legs.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin very soft and feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that the size has gotten smaller, but they still do a great job.</li>
            <li> the past, I have ordered from another website so I was glad to get these on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why some reviewers complain about the thickness, these are the same exact size they&#x27;ve always been.</li>
            <li> The condition of my skin is great because I use this regularly and have for 25 years (at least the regular Buf-Puf!!).  </li>
            <li> Like many of the other reviewers, I&#x27;ve been using the Double sided body sponge for 20 years.  </li>
            <li> Scrub lightly, don&#x27;t scrub &amp;#34;your skin off.&amp;#34;  Wish Buf Puf would re-issue their long handled back brushes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other \\&quot;scrubbies\\&quot; and products but nothing comes close to the clean and smooth this little beauty gives me.  </li>
            <li> I buy them in large packages, use them regularly and give them to friends.</li>
            <li> I am usually covered in dust and mud on a daily basis from our trips to the park and this little miracle scrubs it all away beautifully plus leaves my skin amazingly soft.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid I would never find them again, and was so happy to find them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The harder side is fantastic for feet and back and the rest of your body.  </li>
            <li> These double sided sponges, blue slighly rougher than white has kept my entire body from my heels to elbows, and face as well, very well exfoliated, invigorated and smooth.  </li>
            <li> The white end gently exfoliates tender skin ...</li>
            <li> these sponges can be used to replace the old sponges</li>
            <li> I found the poufs to be a mystery when they needed to be replaced unless they were completely falling apart.  </li>
            <li> They do exfoliate but not real deeply, they dissolve before they can really work.</li>
            <li> Works well to exfoliate dead skin cells and leaves skin smooth.  </li>
            <li> The pads are invigorating, but not harsh.  </li>
            <li> So by the time I finish the whole pack, I may not have any skin left</li>
            <li> I have been using Buf-Puf since I was 18 yrs old....</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I am chemically sensitive so can&#x27;t use lotions, etc.</li>
            <li> The two sides for the different areas of the skin were very helpful as well.  </li>
            <li> Can understand being sensitive</li>
            <li> I dont even have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It lasts pretty long, but I change once a month for sanitary reasons.</li>
            <li> I am 64 years old and have been using these since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li> My 2 children also love these sponges, and whenever they come home take a few back with them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve thrown in wash with towels and let air dry, which I like very much. .</li>
            <li> I exfoliate my skin everyday and feel extra clean!</li>
            <li> I started using these pads in Iraq in 2006 - they work a lot better than a washcloth for sloughing off dead skin cells, grime and the sweat of a long day in hell.</li>
            <li> but in my opinion it is too small to be held comfortably in the hand.  </li>
            <li> Im not sure you will enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> exactly what I expected them to be</li>
            <li> Plus, they way out last other similar sponges, more than making up for the extra cost.</li>
            <li> They may seem rough at first, and i wouldn&#x27;t use it on my face, ever.  </li>
            <li> I am in my 50&#x27;s and can tell you that I use the blue side on my face to remove dead skin and fine lines.</li>
            <li> i wanted more of a tough scrubber then a soft sponge and this wasn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> I just recently ordered me some more so that I can use them on my back (since I have a little back acne) to see if it will help clear up my bacne.</li>
            <li> No need for one of those new facial twirly scrubbers.  </li>
            <li> I have used Buf-Puf Facial Sponge for a long time but this is my first purchase of the body sponge.</li>
            <li> and I can actually wash my whole back</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin soft, sloughing old skin on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> My wife likes these so much every year I order enough to last her a year</li>
            <li> Leaving a one star because the description clearly says &amp;#34;Pack of 6&amp;#34; yet I got ONLY ONE—for over $20?—in my delivery!!</li>
            <li> This one is a tad rough even on the gentle side.  </li>
            <li> this one is not the same as the old one...</li>
            <li> Years ago (back in the early 80&#x27;s), I moved from HI to NC, and could not find my buff puffs in any store.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like doing a soft facial peel all over your body..</li>
            <li> use natural hand made bar soap but have used commercial liquid body washes with it as well.  </li>
            <li> I use the white side to gently exfoliate my face and it seems to really help to get rid of dead skin.</li>
            <li> I love the scruffy side of the sponge for those extra dry areas that need a little extra buffing.  </li>
            <li> It may cost a little more than the small sponges I have bought at other stores, but these are well worth it.</li>
            <li> One side is for your face and gentle areas, the other is harsher.</li>
            <li> This sponge can help not only remove feD skin with its rough sude but gently cleanse you with a softer side.</li>
            <li> Green-side for the body, white for the neck, throat and face - might be too coarse for sensitive skin but works well otherwise.</li>
            <li> In general, I use the facial and body buff puffs as part of my skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> Now it keeps my skin soft and I don&#x27;t have the dulling dry layer</li>
            <li> If you feel that your skin is sensitive, I would recommend only using on dry areas, like foot soles or elbows.</li>
            <li> I work on cars and it is very hard to get clean at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I used the typical mesh nylon pouf sponge for years and once I purchased the buf-puf back in early 2012 have never looked back.  </li>
            <li> They last a fairly long time, but eventually flatten down, so that I replace with a new one.</li>
            <li> I use very little soap as this holds a lot of lather for my whole body from just a couple tablespoons of bodywash.</li>
            <li> These will be a standard staple in my home for a long time.</li>
            <li> so they last a long time and don&#x27;t get moldy.</li>
            <li> and they last quite a long time.  </li>
            <li> They last a long time, once they go flat</li>
            <li> I normally replace mine every few months.</li>
            <li> Wow are they ROUGH!!</li>
            <li> there is a soft scrub side and a slightly rougher side for choice of scrub</li>
            <li> Before I started using this sponge, my skin was rough and the skin on my upper arms and legs had tiny bumps.  </li>
            <li> Use the soft side for back, arms, trunk and the rougher side to debride dead skin cells from legs.  </li>
            <li> all the dry, dead skin is completely removed without all the hassle of a facial.</li>
            <li> I also felt that between washings the tiny holes in the pouf type sponge would trap dirt and other suds if not properly rinsed after each shower.</li>
            <li> But on Sundays, while all the other soldiers were waiting in line to use the pay phones, I took my body sponge (with handle for washing the back) and made up for those 90 second showers.  </li>
            <li> Initially I purchased them to eliminate the little bumps on the back of my upper arms.</li>
            <li> They also sell a backscrub stick, but I never liked that much.  </li>
            <li> continue to buy and use this product as long as it is made, and still made well.&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
            <li> I used to buy these at the store but havent seen them for a long time.</li>
            <li> I used them for a long time</li>
            <li> I used this product long ago</li>
            <li> To me, the sponge is rough as all get out, including the white wash side.  </li>
            <li> I used these sponges a long time ago and  forgot about them.</li>
            <li> so I gently use it on my face with my cleanser in a slow motion.</li>
            <li> but it does not seem to irritate it (only use every other day).</li>
            <li> (I do love Buf-Puf, though, which is why I was hoping that this &amp;#34;subscription&amp;#34; would save me money and aggravation! :-(</li>
            <li> They rinse and air dry</li>
            <li> I throw them in the washer and let them air dry.</li>
            <li> My skin is never flaky or dry...</li>
            <li> Dead skin between toes is the major cause of foot odor.</li>
            <li> Cannot believe I used to use big, fluffy, hard to keep clean loofahs in the past.</li>
            <li> Now I use the Buf-Puf daily in the shower from the neck down.</li>
            <li> I keep an extra in my pedicure kit for buffing down heels and toes.</li>
            <li> I just wish Buff Puff made an all &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34; version as the white compresses down after a month or so.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m late-40ish, and I really do have incredibly soft, smooth skin on the worst of areas, and I think it&#x27;s all due to the use of Buff Puff through the years.</li>
            <li> And even the white side is a little rough.</li>
            <li> Too bad this isn&#x27;t available as an attachment for my Clarisonic!</li>
            <li> My only regret is that they are not available in Canada.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Any time I miss a day using it in the shower, my skin almost itches the next day from the build-up of dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> Just be careful about using the&lt;br /&gt;blue side on your face until you are used to it.</li>
            <li> Quite a few years ago, I purchased a shower brush with a larger oval sponge.  </li>
            <li> Feels exfoliating but not too rough.</li>
            <li> Green for the body, White (softer) for the face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pad seems to distort on the end of the stick and it&#x27;s harder to rinse.  </li>
            <li> Items arrived as described and as expected on time.  </li>
            <li> Product as expected.</li>
            <li> But be careful with using the rougher side on tender skin.  </li>
            <li> it tends not to be so rough</li>
            <li> ,especially feet.  not too harsh.  </li>
            <li> I use on my back primarily because although the worst of the body acne is long gone, I can&#x27;t live without</li>
            <li> I have read that the handled &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; is no longer being sold, but other reviewers have said they can still find it on-line.</li>
            <li> Rough on skin so be ware!</li>
            <li> I am now a lifelong fan!</li>
            <li> One word of advice is that this sponge needs to be used when the skin is very wet, in order to avoid discomfort or irritation.</li>
            <li> with regular use and daily moisturizing ALL rough patches will disappear - even folliculitis (or &#x27;chicken skin&#x27; as my friend calls it) will forever be a daily user!!!</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars, but it gets thin and flat after about 2 weeks of daily use.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t rub too hard if you&#x27;re not used to them and follow with a body lotion if possible.</li>
            <li> I would consider my skin average in sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> I have been using these to exfoliate for at least the last 10-years.  </li>
            <li> We now use them to slough off rough elbows and dead skin.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried other products because the Buf-Pufs are a little hard to find, but always go back.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of scar tissue from burns and these don&#x27;t tear up my skin like some other sponges!</li>
            <li> The dermatologist originally prescribed them for me when my acne was bad on back/chest/face/arms.  </li>
            <li> so we use less soap.  </li>
            <li> Not as fluffy after a few uses but that was expected.</li>
            <li> Green side is less abrasive.</li>
            <li> They do hurt a little</li>
            <li> Scrubs are expensive and don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the time it took to get here, I&#x27;ve been so spoiled by products fulfilled by Amazon that it was hard to wait for my package.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like some sort of secret that younger women don&#x27;t have a clue about.</li>
            <li> For the price I think the sponges should stay fluffy longer.</li>
            <li> This sponge keeps the dead skin cells from clogging my pores, which contributes to that &amp;#34;aged&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li> Still, I&#x27;m not going to let these sponges go to waste.  </li>
            <li> but I would not have wasted $26...</li>
            <li> replace after about 2-3weeks of everyday use.</li>
            <li> All other sponges are a waste indeed!!</li>
            <li> I have used some that were way too harsh and others that went to almost nothing in very little time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Usually change out every 2 months but before tossing use it a few times with our usual cleanser to scrub the tub or sink, outdoor pots or grill.</li>
            <li> Their small size makes them a bit unorthodox to handle when washing.</li>
            <li> Not sure why there is a requirement of words</li>
            <li> These are really starting to become difficult to find in my area, so ordering them in bulk is the way to go.</li>
            <li> I usually keep  Buf-Pufs in for when anyone comes to visit.  </li>
            <li> I have used Buf Puf sponges for at least 20 years by now if not more.</li>
            <li> I have been using Buf-Puf body scrubbers for years and the replacemnet sponges are so hard to find.</li>

            <li> I have tried for years to find the BUf-Puf in stores, and finally (DUH) looked on the internet.</li>
            <li> This is inexpensive, lasts for at least a month, and will do the exfoliating trick.</li>
            <li> I used these for at least 20 years.</li>
            <li> Plus, no more wash cloths to launder!</li>
            <li> No more medication!</li>
            <li> Scrub all those dead skin cells off!!  </li>
            <li> They were basically impossible to find locally</li>

            <li> Very hard to find in the stores anymore.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to find the double-sided Buf-Puf body sponge, so  </li>
            <li> It is abrasive without being uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Secret&#x27;s all mine!    </li>
            <li> Even traveling a weekend without makes me all itchy and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> These are so hard to find in the store and now I have a pack of 6!!!  </li>
            <li> This product will also help with controlling \\&quot;chicken skin bumps\\&quot; and ingrown hairs.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using the BufPuf double-sided body sponge for years and have never found another brand that is as good as the Buf-Puf quality.  The sponge has two abrasive sides  - one mildly abrasive and the other a bit more abrasive.  These sponges last for months without deteriorating.  It makes skin smooth and clean.  It is the best!!!!</li>
            <li> Well, first of all I was under the impression that I was getting a pack of six.  The description says Buf-Puf Double-sided body sponge (Pack of 6).  I received one.  Still was charged over $20.  For a disposable sponge.</li>
            <li> They would be more utilitarian if they were a bit larger. Their small size makes them a bit unorthodox to handle when washing.</li>
            <li> My skin feels simply fantastic after cleansing and my skin absorbs my lotion much better since using the double-sided sponge.  It brings back GREAT MEMORIES!!!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice product.  I have used this item for years and am happy to see they are still available.</li>
            <li> Have been using these for years and my skin is always soft and smooth - even for an older chick. If I don&#x27;t shower with a Buf-Puf, I don&#x27;t feel like I am as clean as I could be.  It is abrasive without being uncomfortable.  A great exfolliator.  Wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Buf-Puf body scrubbers for years and the replacemnet sponges are so hard to find. Only available on-line these days. I have young adult kids with back acne and these work beautifully! Great value on a hard to find item.</li>
            <li> This Buf-Puf is just ok.  I have had better exfoliator pads.  This one is a tad rough even on the gentle side.  I would consider my skin average in sensitivity.  The price is reasonable which is why I purchased them.</li>
            <li> I use this product to shower everyday.they stopped selling it in stores and was very upset till I found it on Amazon! THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> I have used Buf Puffs for years.  Like the experience of others, this product keeps my extremely dry skin in pretty good shape.  This product will also help with controlling \\&quot;chicken skin bumps\\&quot; and ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I started using Buf-Puf products about 25 years ago on the advice of my dermatologist.  When I saw the backscrubber I thought it was a great idea.      I now purchase the sponges in bulk.  My only regret is that they are not available in Canada.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin soft &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> buff-puf body scrubbers are hard to find in stores. thank you for selling them bulk at  a reasonable price(and fast delivery).</li>
            <li> I love my buf puf for the face and thought that the body sponge would be wonderful.  I didn&#x27;t by it for use with the back scrub handle but rather as an all over body sponge but in my opinion it is too small to be held comfortably in the hand.  It needs to be about 50% larger and thicker.</li>
            <li> This is a great body sponge at exfoliating and giving lots of lather.  I can&#x27;t find them in my local stores anymore so I order them on line.  The multipack does save money and is a good deal.</li>
            <li> MY HUSBAND CAN&#x27;T BATHE WITHOUT A BUFF PUFF</li>
            <li> These will be a standard staple in my home for a long time.</li>
            <li> Dead skin between toes is the major cause of foot odor. This exfoliates the skin  and is much more effective than a wash cloth. If used regularly, you will never have foot odor again.</li>
            <li> ove these for bathing and like to have some always on hand.</li>
            <li> My favorite go-to exfoliator for years.....</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for years.  I order it by the case online now.  Before I started using this sponge, my skin was rough and the skin on my upper arms and legs had tiny bumps.  The skin on my lower legs used to flake.  I use the blue rougher side on my body and the white side on my face and moisturize after getting out of the shower.  My skin is very smooth and soft now.  I love Buf-Puf!</li>
            <li> I have tried for years to find the BUf-Puf in stores, and finally (DUH) looked on the internet. To my surprise it was offered on Amazon. My husband and I love the Buf-Puf.It does a fantastic job on your back (use the green side) and for a light buf the white side is great on the rest of your body.   I would recommend this for everyone. The back scrub handle has lasted for years, you just replace the buffer.</li>
            <li> Remove the outer layer(s) of dead dry skin and you reveal fresher skin that can absorb moisturizer more effectively. It also stimulates your body to make new layers to replace those removed.  These do the job effectively and can be used with any cleanser.  They rinse and air dry well. Very hard to find in the stores anymore.</li>
            <li> Cannot believe I used to use big, fluffy, hard to keep clean loofahs in the past. Buff puffs knock those things out of the water. After using buff puffs, I realized all you need is a simple sponge - that&#x27;s very efficient! These simple oval sponges with a rough and very rough side, make exfoliating way more easy with silky smooth results. Also, they&#x27;re small and easy to rinse/keep clean for more use. Whoever made these, thanks for the wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Have used 3M buff puff for 30 plus years... this one is not the same as the old one... still pretty good but not the same. Green side is less abrasive. Good price on the product.</li>
            <li> Always please with this product. I am a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for years. They are a great product and I can&#x27;t find them anywhere, it seems, except Amazon. They are perfect to use before applying sunless tanning products apparently but I just use them to wash myself in the shower. My skin stays smooth and I always feel so fresh and clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> I use these sponges in place of a washcloth and have for years.  They work great for body and face.</li>
            <li> I purchased this 6 pack because it was a better buy than ordering them 2 at a time from [...].  They&#x27;re good quality &amp; seem to be the original product.  I&#x27;m happy with them.</li>
            <li> Love them. Exfoliates my skin and it feels  like  a massage.</li>
            <li> Love these glad they are available on amazon</li>
            <li> Product is very good and is great to use. Plan to purchase more when needed.  Much better than others I  have tried.</li>
            <li> Have loved Buff Puffs since back in the day! Years ago (back in the early 80&#x27;s), I moved from HI to NC, and could not find my buff puffs in any store. Since it was pre-internet days, I wrote the company a long letter telling them my dilemma, and within weeks I received a huge box full of all sorts of different sizes of Buff Puffs. OK, I know this has nothing to do with much of anything, just wanted to share my deep appreciation of this underrated product.     It&#x27;s like some sort of secret that younger women don&#x27;t have a clue about. I really don&#x27;t understand why they aren&#x27;t hanging in every drug and discount store. Was thrilled to get this box of 6 a few weeks ago, and when I received it, I reluctantly gave have one to each of my daughters and they love it too!     I&#x27;m late-40ish, and I really do have incredibly soft, smooth skin on the worst of areas, and I think it&#x27;s all due to the use of Buff Puff through the years. My guy simply can&#x27;t believe it and I love getting the compliments! He thinks I&#x27;m just exceptional like that. Secret&#x27;s all mine!    Thank you Buff Puff!!</li>
            <li> This sponge can help not only remove feD skin with its rough sude but gently cleanse you with a softer side. It works well with bar or liquid soap.</li>
            <li> Pricey, but worth it.  I&#x27;ve tried cheaper copies but always love these.  Lasts quite a while, too.  So, I suppose you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Great product recommended by a dermatoligist when I was a teenager,&lt;br /&gt;and I&#x27;ve been using a new one about every eight weeks for many, many years.&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to buy and use this product as long as it is made, and still made well.&lt;br /&gt;Much better than a washcloth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years.  They are really hard to find in the local stores anymore, so I am  happy that Amazon continues to sell them.  I use them in the shower on the plastic back-scrubber handle that used to be sold with them.  They last a fairly long time, but eventually flatten down, so that I replace with a new one.</li>
            <li> The one and only Buf-Puf has many imitators but none measure up in my opinion. I have used some that were way too harsh and others that went to almost nothing in very little time. Buf-Puf is the best for exfoliating.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years and love it.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product. I couldn&#x27;t find it in a local store. I have really bad keratosis Pilaris. I use it with a body wash. It does a great job smoothing my skin.</li>
            <li> I decided to try these out based on the excellent reviews. Wow are they ROUGH!! Even on the gentle side, I felt like I was using a brillo pad on my skin! Much too rough to be useful for me. I&#x27;ll stick with my body scrub for exfoliation.</li>
            <li> the best!!!! deep clean my skin</li>
            <li> I have been using the Buf-Puf body sponge since the 1980&#x27;s. The oval shape is ideal for lightly exfoliating around the eyelids/nose area.  The white end gently exfoliates tender skin ... but for deeper exfoliation, the aqua blue side does the job without any abrasive feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply put, this Buf-Puf Double-Sided Body Sponge is a great BODY SPONGE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SEE MY PHOTOS IN CUSTOMER IMAGES&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course I am paying more for these sponges, but they do not soften as quickly as the bargain brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope my review was helpful ... Jeffrey A. (Jeff)</li>
            <li> Quality product made in USA.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It is very hard to find the double-sided Buf-Puf body sponge, so  this was the best way to buy them.  I will certainly be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for over 25 years, and LOOOVE them!  The dermatologist originally prescribed them for me when my acne was bad on back/chest/face/arms.  Now that I&#x27;ve outgrown that teen phase, they still make my skin feel truly clean.  No need for one of those new facial twirly scrubbers.  The soft side of this puf gently cleans tender areas (face/throat).  The harder side is fantastic for feet and back and the rest of your body.  Plus, no more wash cloths to launder!</li>
            <li> I used to buy these at the store but havent seen them for a long time. I love to use them and am glad I found them here.</li>
            <li> My favorite. Just wished they brought back the back nadle and I wish it was cheaper. This is so hard to find anywhere.</li>
            <li> Ease of use in my bathing procedure.  The double sided sponge can be used on the knees and elbows, along with a facial sponge.</li>
            <li> These are no longer sold in my local stores, so have had to buy them online.  This was the best price I found, even on eBay!  They were just as described and arrived promptly and in good condition.  I will buy these again!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for years...so long can&#x27;t remember exactly how many.  This ingenous handy bath product leaves skin thorougly cleaned and feeling healthy; keep one in my travel kit so I don&#x27;t leave home without it!</li>
            <li> I started using these many years ago in my teens and have had great results with the gentle exfoliation these provide.  They had become increasingly difficult to find in my local stores, so I was very happy to find them in a multi-pack on Amazon.  Still a great product and the shipping couldn&#x27;t be more convenient.  Highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> I have been using these to exfoliate for at least the last 10-years.  Initially I purchased them to eliminate the little bumps on the back of my upper arms. Now I use the Buf-Puf daily in the shower from the neck down. The only negative is that the size has gotten smaller, but they still do a great job.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a good buy!!! The rougher side of the sponge is beautiful on your body, invigorating.&lt;br /&gt;I can 100% recommend this product&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001EJOPTS Buf-Puf Double-Sided Body Sponge (Pack of 6)]]</li>
            <li> Works great on elbows and feet!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like doing a soft facial peel all over your body..</li>
            <li> I bought the body Buf-Puf sponges for exfoliating my legs, knees and elbows. In general, I use the facial and body buff puffs as part of my skin care regimen. I love benefits of using these sponges. Great quality and quantity.</li>
            <li> My favorite washing sponge!</li>
            <li> Use it every day and I think it is great.</li>
            <li> Five stars because I like these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes you want something more than a wash cloth and these Buf-Pufs are great! It is two-sided... one side is smooth and the blue side is a bit firmer... good for scrubbing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past, I have ordered from another website so I was glad to get these on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No stores here sell these Buf-Puf&#x27;s... yay! Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the body and facial Buf Pufs for years.  They are easier to handle than wash cloths.  I can fold  them over and clean my ears easier also.  I bought a six pack of them and use a different one each day.  I throw them in the washer and let them air dry.</li>
            <li> Since we can no longer purchase the back scrubber by buf puf these sponges can be used to replace the old sponges&lt;br /&gt;on your buf puf plastic scrubber.</li>
            <li> Excellent price, especially for a 6 pack!!!  No need to run around to stores looking for these anymore, I have plenty to keep me in stock.</li>
            <li> I have the handle for these, and just love them! I was depressed that every store in my area in NC stopped carrying the body sponges, so I was thrilled to see that I can get them here! I use the auto-ship so I never run out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any time I miss a day using it in the shower, my skin almost itches the next day from the build-up of dead skin cells. It really keeps your skin soft and smooth. I agree with another poster- I can&#x27;t believe these aren&#x27;t in every drugstore and big chain in America! Someone tell Dr. Oz, lol!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re great for men, too!</li>
            <li> I love these. I&#x27;ve been using them for years and years and there&#x27;s nothing like it. They exfoliate well and dry quickly so they last a long time and don&#x27;t get moldy. This 6-pack is at a great price and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> exactly what I expected them to be</li>
            <li> I LOVE these &amp;#34;sponges&amp;#34; and have used them longer than I can recall.  I still have the &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; with the handle to use with the sponge, in the shower.  We always take it with us when we travel, it is the best way to get to those hard-to-each areas of one&#x27;s back.  I have read that the handled &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; is no longer being sold, but other reviewers have said they can still find it on-line. Anyway, even using these sponges alone, they are wonderful with the one side for more fragile skin and the other side for rougher-skin areas such as knees, elbows, etc.  I stocked up on the sponges because I always fear they will be discontinued, as sometimes happens with good products. Although the box says to use a sponge for only a few months, (a sales gimmick I am sure) we clean ours well and they last for years.</li>
            <li> Great product, and excellent service by vendor. One of the best skin care products. Bern using it for years. Nothing else works as well.</li>
            <li> I love Buf Puf Body Sponge!  I use the blue side for my body and I feel really clean after the shower.  when I travel and don&#x27;t have my Buf Puf, I can&#x27;t wait to get to my shower for that clean feeling.  it&#x27;s just not the same without it.</li>
            <li> I have used Body Buf since it first came out and just can&#x27;t use anything else.  I have one in each bathroom, one in a suitcase, and in my gym bag.  It keeps my skin free of bumps and thus have very smooth skin (I&#x27;m 70 years old).  I use the blue side for my entire body and the white side for my face.  It&#x27;s great to use with liquid soaps, which can be expensive, and it doesn&#x27;t take much soap for a full body scrub.  If you want really smooth skin, this is the product to use.  I love it and a shower isn&#x27;t the same without it because I don&#x27;t feel clean.  But the best part is getting rid of any bumps on my skin, especially the backs of the upper arms.  Try it, you will like it.</li>
            <li> My second order on these, I love them. Impossible to find at a drug store anymore so a 6 pack is awesome. They last forever, I got a year out of the last 6 pack, throw them in the laundry with a load, they come out just fine.</li>
            <li> These pads really help renew my skin.  I feel like all the dry, dead skin is completely removed without all the hassle of a facial.</li>
            <li> I only bought this because amazon is no longer carrying my favorite , Aquasentials Dual Texture Bath Sponge (Twin Pack). These Buf-Puf  are ok at best.</li>
            <li> Wow! If these don&#x27;t exfoliate, nothing will. Just wash with a lighter touch. Skin feels smooth and clean after use.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE THINGS!!! I used them for a long time then they disappeared from store shelves. I guess nobody realized how great they are at exfoliating the body. I love how soft my skin feels after a shower when I use it. I was ecstatic to find them again- and I signed up for subscribe and save so I will never be without my Buf-Pufs again! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I ordered the pack of 6 and only received 1.</li>
            <li> totally great would buy it again</li>
            <li> Hard to find but I love this product.  Gets rid of dead skin and makes your skin feel great. I&#x27;ve been using for years but u can&#x27;t find in stores</li>
            <li> I love these. I&#x27;ve used them since the 1990&#x27;s and they are so nice. This is the only place I can find the two sided body sponge anymore and I hope they never get rid of it. It is the best exfoliating sponge I have ever tried and they last a good while.</li>
            <li> These fit the handles that they used to sell so you can reach your back.  I love the texture because it lightly scrubs and leaves your skin soft.  Was so happy to find these because they are not in the stores in my area!</li>
            <li> I love this, I&#x27;ve been using this for years</li>
            <li> The best to take bath with or a shower.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for 15 years now.  It helps the soap lather and not leave residue and it makes my skin feel smoother.  I would give it 5 stars, but it gets thin and flat after about 2 weeks of daily use.  For the price I think the sponges should stay fluffy longer.</li>
            <li> I used the typical mesh nylon pouf sponge for years and once I purchased the buf-puf back in early 2012 have never looked back.  The buf-puf is made of a polyurethane binder and polyester fiber.  It has great scrubbing power on one side and a more gentle scrub on the other.  When it comes time to replace it, you don&#x27;t have to guess:  The sponge will not have elasticity (more like a flattened pancake) and the fibers will seem knotted in appearance.  I found the poufs to be a mystery when they needed to be replaced unless they were completely falling apart.  I also felt that between washings the tiny holes in the pouf type sponge would trap dirt and other suds if not properly rinsed after each shower. The overall scrub effect from the buf-puf sponge feels like it is doing a better job and my skin feels smooth at the elbows, knees, and heals without being overly abrated.  I use very little soap as this holds a lot of lather for my whole body from just a couple tablespoons of bodywash. Great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these body sponges for years. They do a great job of exfoliating your skin. Just be careful about using the&lt;br /&gt;blue side on your face until you are used to it.</li>
            <li> I love this body sponge!  I have used Buf-Puf Facial Sponge for a long time but this is my first purchase of the body sponge. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Always loved them always will. I wish they were easier to come by. I can&#x27;t find them in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> Love this item and it hangs easily in my shower when attached to the long, hooked handle (sold separately). Makes it easy to reach my back. Have been using these for several years.</li>
            <li> I used this product long ago then stores stopped selling it.  I&#x27;m happy to have found it again. Leaves your skin silky smooth by exfoliating.  Follow up with your favorite moisturizer and in about a week your skin will start feeling like velvet.  If you have tender skin use a light touch and the white side.  Blue side is for rougher areas.  Don&#x27;t expect results overnight and don&#x27;t scrub too hard!</li>
            <li> Good facial / body scrubbing product.</li>
            <li> These are great for exfoliating.  I use my regular Body wash with them.  In addition, an earlier reviewer stated that they were great to use prior to applying a self tanner.  I found that to be a very true statement!</li>
            <li> these are great for putting a little bit of body wash or soap on, lathering up, and really giving your body a scrub.  the softer side works for most of the body, and the rougher spot for the bottom of the feet and other tougher spots.</li>
            <li> I have a stoma and these have been the most efficient and most precise pads for cleaning the skin onto which the appliance is to be adhered.  This makes adhesion a sure thing.</li>
            <li> Quite a few years ago, I purchased a shower brush with a larger oval sponge.  It is ideal to scrub one&#x27;s own back and I have used nothing else.  Initially, I was able to purchase the sponges across the counter with no problem, but lately no sponges have been available.  Naturally, I was pleased to find these.</li>
            <li> This sponge is my favorite and I don&#x27;t understand why it ceased to be available in retail shops.  Glad it&#x27;s not entirely discontinued (but I&#x27;m apprehensive).</li>
            <li> I have a dog and spend a lot of time playing in the dirt with her.  I am usually covered in dust and mud on a daily basis from our trips to the park and this little miracle scrubs it all away beautifully plus leaves my skin amazingly soft.  You&#x27;d never know I start my day tumbling in dirt and gravel!&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other \\&quot;scrubbies\\&quot; and products but nothing comes close to the clean and smooth this little beauty gives me.  I have a hard time finding this body puff in stores anymore so I&#x27;m thrilled to be able to get it here.  I love that it can be tossed in the washer.  The two sides are great so I can adjust my pressure as well as the side I use depending on where I&#x27;m scrubbing.  I even use it on my face rather than having a separate face buff puff.  This baby does a great job between my toes, behind ears, under arms, around my neck, shoulders, chest, hips, elbows, knees, arms, legs, feet and between my toes.  If I left anything out, it&#x27;s likely an oversight in typing since I use this as my one for all washing device.  I don&#x27;t feel like I can get clean enough without it.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;I use natural hand made bar soap but have used commercial liquid body washes with it as well.  It works great for whatever kind of cleanser you are using.</li>
            <li> Wonderful!!! I really love it. It is really effective.</li>
            <li> I have been using then since they were introduced to the public. I exfoliate my skin everyday and feel extra clean!</li>
            <li> Scrubs are expensive and don&#x27;t last very long. They do exfoliate but not real deeply, they dissolve before they can really work. This is inexpensive, lasts for at least a month, and will do the exfoliating trick. Just don&#x27;t overdo it or you will remove your hide (which is painful and counterproductive). I use Buf-Pufs and have for years. They are pretty perfect.</li>
            <li> Use them for years - love the feel when I scrub my back.  Won&#x27;t use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;C S Battista</li>
            <li> These are by far the best bath sponges. Feels exfoliating but not too rough. Blue side is tougher than the white side</li>
            <li> I always like using this product. It makes my skin feel refreshing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years and swear by them.  The white side works well while soaping the whole body (gently on the face) and while washing yourself you can exfoliate.  The blue side is primarily for the feet (it&#x27;s a bit rougher) and does a great job of exfoliating them as well.</li>
            <li> love these body sponges they are great for showering and removing dead skin cells got them in a timely manner</li>
            <li> I like these body sponges a lot.  The sponge cleans really well and does not irritate the skin. They are easily disposable after 4-6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Two Sided is Great: Green for the body, White (softer) for the face.&lt;br /&gt;Works great with liquid Body Wash. Yep.</li>
            <li> Love these puffs. Makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> Works well to exfoliate dead skin cells and leaves skin smooth.  So much better than those large bath poofs.</li>
            <li> Will love and use these for life. Just better than anhing for making your skin clean. I used these for at least 20 years.</li>
            <li> I wish they were a tad larger, but these sponges are great.</li>
            <li> good stuff. Must have gotten close to a 100 after all these years</li>
            <li> So glad I found them again!!!</li>
            <li> Have been using these for years.  Still the best deal in town.  The six pack is the best of the best since it brings the cost under 5 bucks per.  The pads are invigorating, but not harsh.  Unlike some loofa pads, they wear softer with age which allows for gentle (new) and more energetic (older) pad scrubs.  The more energetic scrubs impact peripheral circulation; great for older folks with more sensitive skin and decreased circulation efficiency.  They also sell a backscrub stick, but I never liked that much.  The pad seems to distort on the end of the stick and it&#x27;s harder to rinse.  A pad in the hand is worth two on the brush, lol.</li>
            <li> I have used Buf Puf since high school (I am now in my 50&#x27;s) and I always get compliments on the smoothness of my skin. This sponge keeps the dead skin cells from clogging my pores, which contributes to that &amp;#34;aged&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li> Love it.  I always order for the year.  Not sure why there is a requirement of words but I like to keep it simple so I love it.</li>
            <li> I think this Body Buf-Puf is a little bit larger than what I remember buying at the drugstores but still does a great job of scrubbing and making you feel really fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Items arrived as described and as expected on time.  Very happy with purchase.  The sponges fit the Buf-Puf handle perfectly and my husband uses it every day.</li>
            <li> love love! so glad I can still find these</li>
            <li> I have been using this double-sided sponges for 2oyrs. I am in my 50&#x27;s and can tell you that I use the blue side on my face to remove dead skin and fine lines. It works. At my age, I do not have any fine lines or wrinkles, and I believe it to the Buf-Puf pad daily usage. Great Product, I  recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> This product cleans and protects my skin so that I do not have to worry with acne.and this is a true factor in my purchase.</li>
            <li> with regular use and daily moisturizing ALL rough patches will disappear - even folliculitis (or &#x27;chicken skin&#x27; as my friend calls it) will forever be a daily user!!!</li>
            <li> I originally bought these for my wife as an impromptu, informal gift.  She did not like them.  Well, me being one who hates wasting money decided to use them myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good - Produces a good lather with my preferred body wash, [[ASIN:B00127S53E Nivea For Men, Cool, Hair and  Body Wash, 16.9-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 3)]], using just a dab. Leaves you feeling clean and well scrubbed.  Fits the hand well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad - To me, the sponge is rough as all get out, including the white wash side.  I now understand how women are able to bear the pain of childbirth, if they enjoy the feel of this sponge.  Over time I have gotten more used to it, yet it remains a bit too rough for me.  Still, I&#x27;m not going to let these sponges go to waste.  So by the time I finish the whole pack, I may not have any skin left but I would not have wasted $26...lol.</li>
            <li> I have been using Buf-Puf since I was 18 yrs old....My skin is never flaky or dry...I Love My Buf-Puf!!!</li>
            <li> Good product, although my husband wishes they were just a little larger.</li>
            <li> have used these for years!</li>
            <li> I use the white side to gently exfoliate my face and it seems to really help to get rid of dead skin. I have extremely sensitive skin but it does not seem to irritate it (only use every other day). I just recently ordered me some more so that I can use them on my back (since I have a little back acne) to see if it will help clear up my bacne.</li>
            <li> I like these sponges very much.  They are WAAAAY better than those poofy things that fall apart after 2 uses.  They do hurt a little but I&#x27;m getting used to them and will continue to use them.  I will be purchasing more of these.  They definitely get me clean and my skin feels great.</li>
            <li> I adore these!  I hope they never stop making them.  They are all I use for a washcloth.  Keeps you clean, defoliated and smooth!</li>
            <li> Rough on skin so be ware! But that was what i was looking for. Good scrubbing!</li>
            <li> Get this original! Fakes don&#x27;t hold up the same. Loved the pricing!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist and has proven to be beneficial.</li>
            <li> Started using it 3 weeks ago and am in love. My showers now feel like a spa day. Feels great on my back, scrubs away stress.</li>
            <li> I started using these pads in Iraq in 2006 - they work a lot better than a washcloth for sloughing off dead skin cells, grime and the sweat of a long day in hell. I believe Monk, the OCD detective, would approve of how well they work. They tend to last me about a month per sponge. I use them with the [[ASIN:B000NKHICK Buf, Puf Back Scrub Body Sponge]]. Overall, I feel that my skin has been less prone to acne (which I used to get on my back) as the result of using these sponges with a good bath gel like [[ASIN:B003Q49OP4 Bath &amp; Body Works Signature Collection for Men Body Wash Oak]].</li>
            <li> Best body sponge ever.</li>
            <li> These pads are great for shower use daily to  promote great skin by scrubbing of the dead  cells we produce daily. Use with a nice liquid soap  and your skin will look healthy and feel fantastic!  White side for face, blue for body...no mold or smell  and they shoot thru the laundry with towels!</li>
            <li> So happy to find these in a pack of 6.  They are a must-have for me in the shower!  My local drugstores don&#x27;t carry this product so very happy to find on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love using this to scrub my back.  Bought the holder for it years ago.</li>
            <li> I used these when they first came out, many years ago.&lt;br /&gt;Stumbled upon it while looking for a body scrubber on Amazon. I am so glad I found them again, as I can&#x27;t find this in stores. Don&#x27;t know why some reviewers complain about the thickness, these are the same exact size they&#x27;ve always been. Will buy again. IMO the white side is best for your body scrubbing. Don&#x27;t rub too hard if you&#x27;re not used to them and follow with a body lotion if possible. My only complaint is the time it took to get here, I&#x27;ve been so spoiled by products fulfilled by Amazon that it was hard to wait for my package. All  is well now as I finally got my package :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these since I was a teen with acne.  Now it keeps my skin soft and I don&#x27;t have the dulling dry layer many women my age have.</li>
            <li> i wanted more of a tough scrubber then a soft sponge and this wasn&#x27;t it. It didn&#x27;t really do what i thougth it did.</li>
            <li> Great service and price. Product as expected.</li>
            <li> Great product but does need to be replaced every month or it will come apart.</li>
            <li> Use rough side for body and soft side for face.</li>
            <li> Love these, cant get softer skin without it.</li>
            <li> This is great for people with acne.  I cannot find these in the store and my husband and I both use these.</li>
            <li> great product use with the stick and I can actually wash my whole back</li>
            <li> Probably a bit coarse for some folks, but this is the only pad I have found that is suitable for all scrubbing.  They tend to go &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; after a month or so but packs of 6 are an easy solution.</li>
            <li> I just used soap and water and found a layer of grit building up on my arms (blcch). I am chemically sensitive so can&#x27;t use lotions, etc. Tried dry buffing, and that is great, but I wanted something to use in the shower. These are so wonderful! You want to also buy the handle so you can do your back. It has two sides. One side is for your face and gentle areas, the other is harsher. The face side is the same is the facial Buf-Puf, but this sponge is bigger, which I also like.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years. These are really starting to become difficult to find in my area, so ordering them in bulk is the way to go. I have very dry skin, and these, along with Dove unscented, keep my skin in really good shape. Highly recommend them. Don&#x27;t be afraid to scrub your body, people!</li>
            <li> They work great and last a long time!</li>
            <li> I have used these for quite sometime. I have always liked them. They work really well and&lt;br /&gt;leave your skin refreshed.</li>
            <li> Fantastic body sponges! Green-side for the body, white for the neck, throat and face - might be too coarse for sensitive skin but works well otherwise. My self and my family&#x27;s been using these for years and we love them!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used facial exfoliating sponges and they were too rough for sensitive skin.  These work perfectly while I am taking my make-up off and cleansing my face.  It definitely does a great job taking all the rough patches around my chin area off and smoothing them out.</li>
            <li> These are so hard to find in the store and now I have a pack of 6!!!  But I&#x27;m not sharing.</li>
            <li> These sponges hold up better than other brands we have tried. We like the scrubbing feeling we get and the choice of a gentler side.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t shower with out it!</li>
            <li> I have used these scrubs for a very long time, when they  were readily available at every drugstore in town.  These double sided sponges, blue slighly rougher than white has kept my entire body from my heels to elbows, and face as well, very well exfoliated, invigorated and smooth.  They also come in handy with the liquid body soaps that I use.  My 2 children also love these sponges, and whenever they come home take a few back with them.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years and still love it - would highly recommend this item for anyone that wants a truly clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this product.  It helped to exfoliate my skin and left it looking clean, buff, and fresh.  The two sides for the different areas of the skin were very helpful as well.  One word of advice is that this sponge needs to be used when the skin is very wet, in order to avoid discomfort or irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years now. There is no way I can reach my back without using the &amp;#34;Buf-Puf  Back Scrub&amp;#34; with the reusable handle. These pads last for a long time, and they leave your skin squeaky clean! I highly recommend this excellent product. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> These sponges are great.  But be careful with using the rougher side on tender skin.  Use the soft side for back, arms, trunk and the rougher side to debride dead skin cells from legs.  Scrub lightly, don&#x27;t scrub &amp;#34;your skin off.&amp;#34;  Wish Buf Puf would re-issue their long handled back brushes.  The current handles are way too short.</li>
            <li> I love the scruffy side of the sponge for those extra dry areas that need a little extra buffing.  Very good.</li>
            <li> I use thiis sponge for my shower, as a body scrubber.  It keeps my skin soft, sloughing old skin on a daily basis.  I love this product and would recommend it to anyone.  I was afraid I would never find them again, and was so happy to find them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Have used the Body Sponge for over 20 years.  Thank goodness for internet ordering just about the time stores stopped carrying them.  Can understand being sensitive, I was at first, if you make plenty of suds on the Puf and don&#x27;t scrub like your trying to clean greasy dishes it tends not to be so rough then you will get used to it and think there&#x27;s no way a regular washcloth can clean as well.  It does hold soap better than a washcloth so we use less soap.  Try it with the back scrub, your back will love you for it.  Even the hubby has his own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From experience don&#x27;t use it if you have a sunburn (ouch!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually change out every 2 months but before tossing use it a few times with our usual cleanser to scrub the tub or sink, outdoor pots or grill.</li>
            <li> I used these sponges a long time ago and  forgot about them. They are sturdy and do a great job. I recommend buying them with the handle and then just buy refills. I am glad I came across them again.</li>
            <li> I usually keep  Buf-Pufs in for when anyone comes to visit.  I have always used them, they exfoliate the skin and leaves it smooth. They last a long time, once they go flat I throw them, a great product,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years. They do a great job at exfoliation. Prevents all sorts of skin issues and insures I really do get clean when I wash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for over 15 years as recommended by my dermatologist. They were basically impossible to find locally so I was glad to find online eventually. I now even use the subscription program here to stock up! I use on my back primarily because although the worst of the body acne is long gone, I can&#x27;t live without I suppose the exfoliation Buf-Puf provides. Even traveling a weekend without makes me all itchy and uncomfortable. I usually use for many months and then discard, but can&#x27;t wait to try some tips I learned here about washing to &amp;#34;re-puf&amp;#34; them!</li>
            <li> Found these a long time ago, and on another site, more expense than Amazon.  GREAT PRODUCT !!!!</li>
            <li> keeps my skin looking fresh and new.,especially feet.  not too harsh.  there is a soft scrub side and a slightly rougher side for choice of scrub</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for several years now. the rough side is great for exfoliating/removing dead or flakey skin. Use one in the shower daily. Nice to have the multi pac available on Amazon. I normally replace mine every few months.</li>
            <li> Love this sponge.  Exfoliates much better than your typical mesh loofah. The darker green side is perfect for rough elbows or knees.</li>
            <li> Love these body sponges. Great price.</li>
            <li> Have been using for years.  They work wonders.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a buf-puf product, and I can defintely understand how people have gotten hooked on them! This is a wonderful sponge! It leaves my skin very soft and feeling refreshed. I love how it can exfoliate like a loofah, but is flexible like a washcloth to clean small body areas, such as ears and in between toes. If you feel that your skin is sensitive, I would recommend only using on dry areas, like foot soles or elbows. The exfoliating side is still \\&quot;soft\\&quot;, but it may be much for a person whose skin cannot handle that. I&#x27;ve thrown in wash with towels and let air dry, which I like very much. . .and replace after about 2-3weeks of everyday use. I am now a lifelong fan!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for probably 25 years.  I love the way my skin feels when I&#x27;m done.  I don&#x27;t know what I would do if they ever discontinue these....</li>
            <li> These Buf-Pufs are great for exfoliating face and body  and they last quite a long time.  My husband and I have been using them for years.  We&#x27;ve tried other products because the Buf-Pufs are a little hard to find, but always go back.  Will never give them up!</li>
            <li> I have purchased these for over 40 years for acne on the back.  My kids used  them and my husband.  We now use them to slough off rough elbows and dead skin.  I hope they never stop making these.  I cannot find them in a store so I am thankful for Amazon.  These things really work!  My husband was on tetracycaline when I met him 31 years ago and I had him use these instead.  No more medication!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, and having recently moved to New Zealand, found that the local chains did not stock this superb product. I am happy that Amazon stock it, delivered it within record time, and at a very reasonable price. The multipack option is great!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all those with problems skins (of all ages, I am 50) this is a superb product, combined with a suitable soap, you can be assured of a clean skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for years and I like the option of being able to buy the 6 pack on Amazon.  They are great for exfoliating and a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Ive been using these for years, I buy them when I can find the lowest price. I have a lot of scar tissue from burns and these don&#x27;t tear up my skin like some other sponges!</li>
            <li> The best body scrub I have ever used</li>
            <li> Too bad this isn&#x27;t available as an attachment for my Clarisonic!</li>
            <li> good product, arrived quickly</li>
            <li> looking forward too buy more as soon as it runs out.  Love the texture definitely exfoliates my skin. Hope they make back brush with the same material;.</li>
            <li> Always a quality product. Hard to find in stores so I&#x27;m so glad to find them on line.&lt;br /&gt;So durable we use them in the shower until they get too &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; and then we use them outside for scrubbing garden stuff clean.</li>
            <li> Well, what do you know? AMAZON even has the additional body sponges to boot! It&#x27;s a must have to purchase the single handle that comes with its own body sponge too!</li>
            <li> I use these in the shower in place of wash cloths, the white side to buff my face and the blue side to smooth elbows and legs.  They rinse easily and dry fast so no worries about mold etc.  I&#x27;ve had to order more since my husband keeps stealing them!  I keep an extra in my pedicure kit for buffing down heels and toes.</li>
            <li> Every thing was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> As with the Buf-Puf facial sponge, I love this product. It may cost a little more than the small sponges I have bought at other stores, but these are well worth it. Both types (facial &amp; body) scrub well (not too rough &amp; not too soft). Plus, they way out last other similar sponges, more than making up for the extra cost. Thank you for continuing to make this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using these buff&#x27;s for over 20 years</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find these in any of the stores, so I really missed them. I use them in the shower, the blue side for my feet, etc. Glad to find them again.</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth and mostly blemish free, from my head to my toes.  I was happy to find a vendor on the internet that carried this so I could continue for another 30 years.</li>
            <li> It removes the dirt and sweat thoroughly. I will not settle for anything. All other sponges are a waste indeed!!</li>
            <li> What the facial sponge does for your head, these do for your body.  They hold more soap and water than a loofah, so that you use less soap as well.  Great for problematic skin as well as keeping skin of any age looking younger and feeling clean.</li>
            <li> My wife likes these so much every year I order enough to last her a year and she is so great full. She has been using them for about 5 years now.</li>
            <li> I have used Buf Puf sponges for at least 20 years by now if not more. I use the white side for my face and the blue for my body. It has been the best scrub ever. My skin speaks for itself. Not a single pimple and nearly no wrinkles, which for my age is amazing.</li>
            <li> Leaving a one star because the description clearly says &amp;#34;Pack of 6&amp;#34; yet I got ONLY ONE—for over $20?—in my delivery!! (I do love Buf-Puf, though, which is why I was hoping that this &amp;#34;subscription&amp;#34; would save me money and aggravation! :-(</li>
            <li> You wanna feel  really clean after your shower?  GET A BUFF PUFF!!  I buy them in large packages, use them regularly and give them to friends.</li>
            <li> The blue side is good for rubbing your feet for calluses but thats about it. Its kinda like sand paper. And even the white side is a little rough. I cant even use that on my body because it doesnt feel good. I dont even have sensitive skin. I do like to exfoliate my face though so I gently use it on my face with my cleanser in a slow motion. It does lather well though when I put soap on it. If you like to really exfoliate every dead skin cell off of you this is perfect! But if your looking for something a little more luxurious and pleasurable Im not sure you will enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years. Always love it. The condition of my skin is great because I use this regularly and have for 25 years (at least the regular Buf-Puf!!).  I can not recommend this enough!  I tell everyone about it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are new to this, it will feel too scratchy for some of you at first but you will get used to it. Grit your teeth and get on with it! Scrub all those dead skin cells off!!  Your skin will love you for it, especially years from now.</li>
            <li> best thing for my face</li>
            <li> Like many of the other reviewers, I&#x27;ve been using the Double sided body sponge for 20 years.  I happened upon them during Basic Training back in 1992.  During the week we only had about 90 seconds to take a shower, so those showers were soap to skin and hope you hit all the smelly parts. :)  But on Sundays, while all the other soldiers were waiting in line to use the pay phones, I took my body sponge (with handle for washing the back) and made up for those 90 second showers.  Talk about getting the grime off.  I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since.  I just wish Buff Puff made an all &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34; version as the white compresses down after a month or so.  Even after the sponge won&#x27;t stay on the handle, it gets moved to the bench for scrubbing the feet.</li>
            <li> works well and exfoliation is very thorough. It lasts pretty long, but I change once a month for sanitary reasons. Not as fluffy after a few uses but that was expected.</li>
            <li> The whole family uses these to bathe with, they invigorate the skin and you feel fresh and clean after using them. They are also excellent for rough patches on elbows and heels.</li>
            <li> Better than a wash cloth.  I love my 2 sided buff puffs and so do my girls on both face and body.</li>
            <li> Pretty awesome. I work on cars and it is very hard to get clean at the end of the day. These actually do a great job.</li>
            <li> As a previous poster mentioned, the size of these sponges is specific to the handles sold by Buf-Puf which are great for scrubbing back, etc. but would be much more user friendly if they were larger.</li>
            <li> I hope I can continue to purchase these on line. I have been using them for over 30 years</li>
            <li> I have always loved these for keeping dry skin at bay in winter and for prepping skin for lotions &amp; potions all year long. It&#x27;s the perfect way to polish your skin before moisturizing.</li>
            <li> and I love them.  They may seem rough at first, and i wouldn&#x27;t use it on my face, ever.  But, they make the rest of me soft and they are great at exfoliating.  I hope they never stop making these.  I love buying in these packages of 6...saves lots of money over buying one at a time at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for over 20 years. Great back scrubber. Excellent price.</li>
            <li> Great! I have used some version or this product for the last 40 years</li>
            <li> would not be without it give it a ten star</li>
            <li> I am 64 years old and have been using these since I was a teenager. My daughters use them as well. There is nothing better to exfoliate your skin which would be the blue side or your face which would be the white side. Everyone should use these they are the best.</li>
            <li> These are the best things to use on the body/face. They really exfoliate the skin and body getting it very clean. I recommend this product to everybody, forget those cheep body buffs and purchase these. They last and you know you are getting clean with them, plus they last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THX,&lt;br /&gt;Kris L. CocKayne</li>
            <li> I love the whole Buf-Puf line and my local stores don&#x27;t carry these anymore.  I am glad I can buy them in bulk!</li>
            <li> W as exactly what I was looking for. Don&#x27;t they make the back brush anymore</li>
