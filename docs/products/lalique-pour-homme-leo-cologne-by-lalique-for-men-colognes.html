            <li>Came within days in perfect condition.  </li>

            <li>the scent isn&#x27;t very good either.</li>
            <li>Very good cologne that make people allways</li>
            <li>and the presentation is beautiful.</li>
            <li>The products arrived like a beautiful woman in a boutique just reached under the counter and pulled out her freshest products.</li>
            <li>I looked forward to receiving this in the mail at the great price it was listed at, but the Eau de Parfum it&#x27;s supposed to be</li>
            <li>great &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; parfum, Lemony with notes of lite floral scents</li>
            <li>A great deal.  </li>
            <li>It was a pleasant surprise and made a great gift.</li>
            <li>Pleasant, but a bit too floral and feminine for my taste.</li>
            <li>It would function as good business or formal stuff.</li>
            <li>GOOD</li>
            <li>bought as a gift for my father and he loved it</li>
            <li>I will truly tell any man if you want a good fragrance</li>
            <li>make your partner wonder why people staire at you good.  </li>
            <li>The EDP has good longevity.</li>
            <li>Everyone in his job comment on how good Lalique  smells.</li>
            <li>I love the smell great product</li>
            <li>Excellent gift for the right price.  </li>
            <li>I got it for a gift and my friend love it!</li>
            <li>I love Lalique and I was very satisfied; it smells so good.</li>
            <li>Nice size as gift for person who travels.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and the fragrance stays all day.</li>
            <li>Mostly just business and business-casual attire, then of course, something for family outings or just to smell nice around the house.</li>
            <li>This has become my favorite on my husband and our oldest grandson liked it</li>
            <li>asking what is this great smell and makes you fresh for hours and hours</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not a snob about it; I love Montale oudhs</li>
            <li>Something I&#x27;ll use up because it&#x27;s OK, inoffensive, but I have no intention whatsoever to replace once it&#x27;s done.</li>
            <li>If you buy it, OK.</li>
            <li>This one, I dumped on my cuffs and recycled the bottle, and I was glad to move on to something else.</li>
            <li>My favorite for years.  </li>
            <li>Purchased many times.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfum for years.</li>
            <li>They all love it, and ask me for the name.</li>
            <li>I love this scent.</li>
            <li>He has been wearing it for many years.</li>
            <li>My wife and I love this fragrance-</li>
            <li>I am glad I took the chance.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and i wish amazon have more instock.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>a dear friend that just love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucy AB</li>
            <li>I bought this fragrance years ago and haven&#x27;t been able to find it again till now</li>
            <li>Yes I would like to say this is one of my all time favorite fragrances it has a very clean scent</li>
            <li>Great classic scent.</li>
            <li>There is enormous competition and some very, very good ones.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m giving it two stars because of my own tastes and experience, and in context of a large wardrobe.</li>
            <li>I saw it advertised in a Neiman Marcus insert for $134,00 a bottle, I was going to order it from them, but decided to see if it was available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Smells great has moderate sillage and exellent longevity.</li>
            <li>ðŸ˜Š 100% genuine</li>
            <li>/&gt;Essentially, I just wanted to dump as much of it as I could on my skin, collar and cuffs to just be done with it and move on to something more interesting.</li>
            <li>(Fujiyama frags) are relatively cheap, synthetic, and absolutely stellar, unique, enjoyable.</li>
            <li>The 4.2 oz bottle has the original carved imprint.</li>
            <li>Will wear, but not on special occasions.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say more; look up reviews on basenotes.net or elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a true bargain for the price, because it is an eau de parfum for men, and it is 4.2 ounces.  </li>
            <li>The scent would be in the Cool Water and Draaker Noir family of scents.  </li>
            <li>I wish that Amazon detects and sells only the good stuffs after inspection .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not BAD.</li>
            <li>and I am glad that Amazon offers it.</li>
            <li>original and fast shipping</li>
            <li>and i really tried to like it specially since i paid 60 bucks but is just not my type of scent.</li>
            <li>This colonge is way too strong and it seems old.  </li>
            <li>its unlike anything else out there and has a wonderful masculine aroma that feels great on the skin and lasts...not a cheap alcohol smell by any means, but rather an expensive and classy smelling fragrance that works for casual or formal..i&#x27;m very happy with this product and will be trying the other lines offered by lalique</li>
            <li>But in the context of my own extensive wardrobe and the variety ofother fragrances available, it simply does not stand out.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product for many years and continue to purchase the same one.</li>
            <li>I love it not only for the smell but also for its size.</li>
            <li>I ordered this larger 4 oz bottle here for the nice low price, but i immediately noticed that this bottle is significantly weaker scent, and wears of way quicker.</li>
            <li>I first purchased a small .15 oz bottle of this at a mall, and absolutely loved the scent.</li>
            <li>and when it dries down it amazing.</li>
            <li>Very different and elegant with a high class smell.</li>
            <li>All of which is to say, I have a significant wardrobe, broad tastes in fragrances, and experience.</li>
            <li>Very classic smell without entering in the dated group of scents.</li>
            <li>I am an avid fragrance collector with an almost embarrassingly large collection of fragrances, including a number of high-end fragrances (numerous selections from Montale, Creeds, Amouage, L&#x27;Artisan Parfumeur, and other high-quality perfumeries), foreign imports including many attars and oudhs, and many, many synthetic designer fragrances.</li>
            <li>longevity is great but is just too green and spicy similar to declaration by cartier not my thing.</li>
            <li>but some of my very favorites are $10 to $50 per bottle.</li>
            <li>so much</li>
            <li>smell absolutely awsome</li>
            <li>This is my second experience that has been fantastic.</li>
            <li>but I really regretted having it as soon as I used it</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>,Im really confused why Amazon sells such things while it has many good stuffs.</li>
            <li>Nice, but weak, and without anything special to make you want another bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sillage is fine for an hour, but by the end of a day, the only way you know you were wearing a fragrance is to smell the fabric directly.</li>
            <li>Also, seems a bit of an older gentleman&#x27;s scent.</li>
            <li>And it last all day especially if it the eau de parfum love it</li>
            <li>The fragrance is unique, masculine, fresh and a little spicy.</li>
            <li>There have been a number of other fragrances I&#x27;ve gone through the same way - OK,</li>
            <li>A little on who I am (as that matters in terms of what your relevant wardrobe is).</li>
            <li>maybe i got an old bottle or something</li>
            <li>This was obviously not the real thing</li>
            <li>Wow, it was almost a hundred dollars</li>
            <li>Another one that I can remember thinking about as equally unimpressive is Banana Republic Classic.</li>
            <li>Polo Double Black is also a true treat, also in this price range, and also synthetic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a father and husband, in his 30s, middle class professional.</li>
            <li>and you can barely smell it the rest of the day.  </li>
            <li>The whole package is nicer and fancier than I had expected.</li>
            <li>When applying any fragrance please consider that there are several factors which can affect the natural smell of your skin and, in turn, the way a scent smells on you.  </li>
            <li>this is really all that I expected.</li>

            <li> When applying any fragrance please consider that there are several factors which can affect the natural smell of your skin and, in turn, the way a scent smells on you.  </li>
            <li> this is really all that I expected.</li>
            <li> Similarly, factor such as dry or oily skin can even affect the amount of time a fragrance will last after being applied</li>
            <li> Amazon I am a bit older and disabled, so if the quality of my experiences continues, I want need a car to go out.</li>
            <li> On skin, longevity is far worse, virtually non-existent no matter how much</li>
            <li> It is so hard to find the real Eau de Parfume at this price.  </li>
            <li> Not a professional, but also not a layman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I being a fragrance lover have purchased, well under ten in the last few weeks.</li>
            <li> nice enough, but synthetic, poor longevity, and ultimately, forgettable.</li>
            <li> The gold colored cap was flimsy and loose and the bottle had a chip on it...</li>
            <li> fragrance is pretty forgettable, a simple, spicy/powdery and fairly dry fragrance.</li>
            <li> It has a slightly smoky edge to the middle notes.</li>
            <li> it is not the real deal.it&#x27;s a big fake.</li>
            <li> Not much need for evening formal wear.</li>
            <li> Included with the bottle is a round bar of soap that has the same scent as the cologne.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what expected,</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> A little on who I am (as that matters in terms of what your relevant wardrobe is). I&#x27;m a father and husband, in his 30s, middle class professional. I don&#x27;t go out and party. Not much need for evening formal wear. Mostly just business and business-casual attire, then of course, something for family outings or just to smell nice around the house. I am an avid fragrance collector with an almost embarrassingly large collection of fragrances, including a number of high-end fragrances (numerous selections from Montale, Creeds, Amouage, L&#x27;Artisan Parfumeur, and other high-quality perfumeries), foreign imports including many attars and oudhs, and many, many synthetic designer fragrances. I have some of the best stuff out there but I&#x27;m not a snob about it; I love Montale oudhs but some of my very favorites are $10 to $50 per bottle. All of which is to say, I have a significant wardrobe, broad tastes in fragrances, and experience. Not a professional, but also not a layman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used up a 4.2oz bottle of Lalique Pour Homme a few months ago. I wore it daily, almost exclusively to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with almost all synthetic fragrances, even a generous, heaping application - including on fabric - does not sufficiently augment the longevity. Sillage is fine for an hour, but by the end of a day, the only way you know you were wearing a fragrance is to smell the fabric directly. On skin, longevity is far worse, virtually non-existent no matter how much you apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is pretty forgettable, a simple, spicy/powdery and fairly dry fragrance. It has a slightly smoky edge to the middle notes. I can&#x27;t really say more; look up reviews on basenotes.net or elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essentially, I just wanted to dump as much of it as I could on my skin, collar and cuffs to just be done with it and move on to something more interesting. It&#x27;s not BAD. It would function as good business or formal stuff. But in the context of my own extensive wardrobe and the variety ofother fragrances available, it simply does not stand out. There have been a number of other fragrances I&#x27;ve gone through the same way - OK, nice enough, but synthetic, poor longevity, and ultimately, forgettable. Something I&#x27;ll use up because it&#x27;s OK, inoffensive, but I have no intention whatsoever to replace once it&#x27;s done. Another one that I can remember thinking about as equally unimpressive is Banana Republic Classic. Nice, but weak, and without anything special to make you want another bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m giving it two stars because of my own tastes and experience, and in context of a large wardrobe. Fragrances by houses like Issey Miyake and Succes de Paris (Fujiyama frags) are relatively cheap, synthetic, and absolutely stellar, unique, enjoyable. Polo Double Black is also a true treat, also in this price range, and also synthetic. I&#x27;m not saying Lalique Pour Homme is bad - it&#x27;s not an ugly or offensive fragrance. Don&#x27;t get me wrong. If you buy it, OK. You won&#x27;t pinch your nose. You won&#x27;t drive away your children. It&#x27;s just not cheap (for a synthetic designer fragrance) and even within the $10-to-$50 range it falls flat. There is enormous competition and some very, very good ones. This one, I dumped on my cuffs and recycled the bottle, and I was glad to move on to something else.</li>
            <li> it is not the real deal.it&#x27;s a big fake.</li>
            <li> I first purchased a small .15 oz bottle of this at a mall, and absolutely loved the scent. I ordered this larger 4 oz bottle here for the nice low price, but i immediately noticed that this bottle is significantly weaker scent, and wears of way quicker. maybe i got an old bottle or something, i just thought i&#x27;d share.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this fragrance!!!</li>
            <li> The essence is subtle. That assumes, one does not bath in it! I have purchased this product for many years and continue to purchase the same one. The retailer delivered on time.[[ASIN:B000CNO4ES Lalique By Lalique For Men. Eau De Parfum Spray 4.2 Ounces]]</li>
            <li> i ordered this one for my husband by mistake.  he does like it, but it wasn&#x27;t the one he wanted.</li>
            <li> This colonge is way too strong and it seems old.  I&#x27;m not sure but what I have smelled on other men smells nothing like this one does.  It just seems like it is outdated or old.</li>
            <li> GOOD BUT WIFE DOESN&#x27;T LIKE IT</li>
            <li> My favorite for years.  Purchased many times.</li>
            <li> Fake perfume. Never again</li>
            <li> If your looking for something different, try this fragrance...its unlike anything else out there and has a wonderful masculine aroma that feels great on the skin and lasts...not a cheap alcohol smell by any means, but rather an expensive and classy smelling fragrance that works for casual or formal..i&#x27;m very happy with this product and will be trying the other lines offered by lalique</li>
            <li> I love Lalique and I was very satisfied; it smells so good. I love it not only for the smell but also for its size. I will order another one for a friend.</li>
            <li> Pleasant, but a bit too floral and feminine for my taste. Also, seems a bit of an older gentleman&#x27;s scent. Will wear, but not on special occasions.</li>
            <li> very good aroma&lt;br /&gt;I bought as a gift for my father and he loved it, I will bought it again when it over</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfum for years. With it, I have had 5 stars plus tips while driving with uber riders. They all love it, and ask me for the name. Buy it!!!</li>
            <li> This has become my favorite on my husband and our oldest grandson liked it so much I got it for him too. His wife too loves it.&lt;br /&gt;The best part is that it lingers forever.</li>
            <li> I love this scent. It is not sold in stores. Well Sometimes you can find it at  a Lalique store.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone loves it.</li>
            <li> My husband prefers the scent because it is not overpowering.  He has been wearing it for many years. I have difficulty finding it and I am glad that Amazon offers it.</li>
            <li> My wife and I love this fragrance- and the presentation is beautiful. The fragrance is unique, masculine, fresh and a little spicy. No flowers nor cloying aroma.</li>
            <li> I looked forward to receiving this in the mail at the great price it was listed at, but the Eau de Parfum it&#x27;s supposed to be it is not.  The fragrance disappears minutes after application and you can barely smell it the rest of the day.  This was obviously not the real thing and I feel cheated by it.  It is so hard to find the real Eau de Parfume at this price.  I unfortunately threw the box it came in out or I would have returned it.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love the smell great product</li>
            <li> The 4.2 oz bottle has the original carved imprint. The bottle comes in a bigger box than the one pictured. The box is square and the lid comes off. Included with the bottle is a round bar of soap that has the same scent as the cologne. The interior of the box has a molded liner in which the bottle and the soap are inserted. The liner is coated with material similar to felt. The whole package is nicer and fancier than I had expected. It was a pleasant surprise and made a great gift.</li>
            <li> original and fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;citrus, cedar and jasmine, with lower notes of vanilla and woods. Recommended use: casual.When applying any fragrance please consider that there are several factors which can affect the natural smell of your skin and, in turn, the way a scent smells on you.  For instance, your mood, stress level, age, body chemistry, diet, and current medications may all alter the scents you wear.  Similarly, factor such as dry or oily skin can even affect the amount of time a fragrance will last after being applied</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews I was a little leery about purchasing this.  I am glad I took the chance.  I saw it advertised in a Neiman Marcus insert for $134,00 a bottle, I was going to order it from them, but decided to see if it was available on Amazon.  Wow, it was almost a hundred dollars a bottle cheaper.  I purchased two bottles.</li>
            <li> This is my fianc&amp;eacute;&#x27;s 2nd choice fragrance when we cannot get the Lalique Le Faune for men.  Still a very good scent.</li>
            <li> i pick this up at jfk and i really tried to like it specially since i paid 60 bucks but is just not my type of scent. longevity is great but is just too green and spicy similar to declaration by cartier not my thing.</li>
            <li> Nice size as gift for person who travels.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve started using this eau de parfum, my wife can&#x27;t stop asking to wear when we go out</li>
            <li> Yes I would like to say this is one of my all time favorite fragrances it has a very clean scent and when it dries down it amazing. I will truly tell any man if you want a good fragrance this is the one. And it last all day especially if it the eau de parfum love it</li>
            <li> This is a true bargain for the price, because it is an eau de parfum for men, and it is 4.2 ounces.  The scent would be in the Cool Water and Draaker Noir family of scents.  It is citrus, and not a sweet or woodsy scent.</li>
            <li> smell absolutely awsome I love it.</li>
            <li> Simply. ..awesome product/smell</li>
            <li> great &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; parfum, Lemony with notes of lite floral scents</li>
            <li> Came within days in perfect condition.  A great deal.  This is my second experience that has been fantastic.</li>
            <li> Very different and elegant with a high class smell. make your partner wonder why people staire at you good.  i luv this product and i wish amazon have more instock.</li>
            <li> Shipped on  time. Smells great has moderate sillage and exellent longevity. Best thing is that is not a tester bottle. Gonna get the Enre Noire next.</li>
            <li> I love it this is really all that I expected.</li>
            <li> Very classic smell without entering in the dated group of scents. The EDP has good longevity. Recommended for casual wear.</li>
            <li> Excellent gift for the right price.  This is the second time ordering this product&lt;br /&gt;for a dear friend that just love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucy AB</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume depending on the reviews but I really regretted having it as soon as I used it .it is not noticeable even by who is sitting next to me moreover it is not noticeable by people in the same room when I spray it as if it is mute perfume ,Im really confused why Amazon sells such things while it has many good stuffs.I wish that Amazon detects and sells only the good stuffs after inspection . thanks</li>
            <li> It smells nice and the fragrance stays all day. My husband loves it. Everyone in his job comment on how good Lalique  smells.</li>
            <li> I being a fragrance lover have purchased, well under ten in the last few weeks. I am a bit of a collector but I wear  everything I buy. The products arrived like a beautiful woman in a boutique just reached under the counter and pulled out her freshest products. The delivery was always there eight hours before when you said they would. I tip my hat to UPS also, I may be prejudice but I also worked in the Package delivery system. These UPS employees just do their jobs beyond reproach. Amazon I am a bit older and disabled, so if the quality of my experiences continues, I want need a car to go out. I don&#x27;t know or want to how you do it so well, just thank&#x27;s. I have to go shopping now. Louis Bullard</li>
            <li> The quality of this product is not very good. The gold colored cap was flimsy and loose and the bottle had a chip on it...the scent isn&#x27;t very good either. I unfortunately bought two not knowing amazon doesn&#x27;t allow you to return or get a refund on perfume purchases. This needs to be stated on the product page. Bad product and terrible Amazon purchase experience!</li>
            <li> I bought this fragrance years ago and haven&#x27;t been able to find it again till now it&#x27;s still the best ever</li>
            <li> Great classic scent. I got it for a gift and my friend love it! ðŸ˜Š 100% genuine</li>
            <li> This is the best cologne for men ever!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what expected, the person I have it to like it, him not I had any complaints about it at all</li>
            <li> Very good cologne that make people allways asking what is this great smell and makes you fresh for hours and hours</li>
