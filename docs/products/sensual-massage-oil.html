            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t love a good massage.  </li>
            <li>It warms to touch, non sticky, absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t taste like anything so wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for that&lt;br /&gt;received discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review</li>
            <li>Goes on very easy.</li>
            <li>but it has a very strong earthly smell, I&#x27;ve return it.</li>

            <li>Great product ;-)</li>
            <li>VERY SMOOTH WITH A THERAPEUTIC SCENT :-)</li>
            <li>This is more like a luxurious moisturizer than a massage oil.</li>
            <li>Interesting....</li>
            <li>She read the ingredients and she realized that most of the oil she uses is in the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Glad I tried this.</li>
            <li>Enjoying the product.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the massage oil.</li>

            <li>Must be a girl thing! :-)</li>
            <li>I love the scent, the feel as it goes on.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent of this...</li>
            <li>Enjoyed the fragrance and the oil wasn&#x27;t sticky like some others.</li>
            <li>The skin stayed smooth even afterwards!</li>
            <li>love the feel of the oil</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>super nice frangrance and very easy to use as a massage oil.  </li>
            <li>She is yet to try it during a massage, but so far, so good!</li>
            <li>The scent is unique because you have so many wonderful essential oils in it......</li>
            <li>Fun.... Enjoyed!</li>
            <li>But I feel that this is overall a very good quality product</li>
            <li>Very enjoyable product ;)</li>
            <li>This massage oil has a very unique scent that I really enjoy.</li>
            <li>a long way!&lt;br /&gt;**I received this product to review and this review is 100% my own opinion!!</li>
            <li>It is silky soft and comes very nicely packaged.</li>
            <li>It is fragrant but not too strong.</li>
            <li>The smell was not too strong and the oil wasn&#x27;t sticky or pasty at all.</li>
            <li>Love this product, it lasts for a long time and it great to use on your partner.</li>
            <li>Adds an extra sensational feel!</li>
            <li>We both enjoyed it very much!</li>
            <li>I was impressed with the ingredients list: sunflower oil, grapeseed oil, safflower oil, rosehip oil and vitamins to name a few.</li>
            <li>This oil is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and goes on smoothly without feeling heavy or sticky...</li>
            <li>Awesome little product!</li>
            <li>I bought this for sexy time with my gf and was pretty dissappointed.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, my husband seems to think the smell is a bit stong, but I really enjoy it, very relaxing.</li>
            <li>all the other oils are good for skin care, I didn&#x27;t mind to put more on me.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling amazing, nourished and soft.</li>
            <li>I did a full body massage on a woman</li>
            <li>&amp; I think the smell is pretty strong; it almost reminds me of a scent you&#x27;d smell around Christmas time...</li>
            <li>It is nice on the skin and is smooth but yet, doesn&#x27;t feel all gross and greasy afterward.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs into skin fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>The smell is just a bit medicinal, but not unpleasant, and not over powering.</li>
            <li>Smells great, not very strong, my bf loves it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a very sultry and sexy scent, you might not like it at first but it will grow on you</li>
            <li>It simply does not get any better!  </li>
            <li>Unlike most other lubricants always leaves tacky feeling, it&#x27;s more like nutritious oil.</li>
            <li>It was strong at first, but slowly became pleasant and soothing.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very silky, especially when you rub your hands together to warm up the oil</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m pretty sure it is safe to get a little in your mouth</li>
            <li>Love the smell of all the essential oils!</li>
            <li>Can I really tell the world the fun?</li>
            <li>Was wanting a oil that got hot when using it and you barly notice the heat if at all when we used it.  </li>
            <li>helped put her in the mood for.... ;-)</li>
            <li>I love that you can order this online and get it is a traditional Amazon box.</li>
            <li>love the big bottle</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for natural based massage oil for awhile, luckily I found this bottle.</li>
            <li>The ylang ylang is very prominent in the scent - there&#x27;s an overall Asian spiciness in the aroma.</li>
            <li>I use it for moisturizing, and it rubs in quickly, doesn&#x27;t ruin clothes and keeps my skin soft all day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pungent and some-what offensive and immediately gives me a headache.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Never got sticky and wasnt really oily when we were done.</li>
            <li>Really has relaxing, sensual feel and smell to it.</li>
            <li>Stimulate and smoothen the skin as you intimately connect with this Sensual Massage Oi</li>
            <li>High quality product!</li>
            <li>I really like this massage oil.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using this oil for a couple of times I can say I really like it.</li>
            <li>It is very soothing and relaxing.</li>
            <li>the fragrance is very relaxing.</li>
            <li>it really doesnt take that much.</li>
            <li>I doesnt get real warn</li>
            <li>my boyfriend likes the smell so that&#x27;s really what matters</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant but not overwhelming, and a relatively small amount of oil is all that&#x27;s necessary for a good rubdown on any body part.  </li>
            <li>and I did her full back neck and sholders.</li>
            <li>Regular oil, its smell not bad at all</li>
            <li>This is a decent massage oil.</li>
            <li>Would definitely make it a better value as the oil would last longer.</li>
            <li>I gave this Massage oil to m mom who is very sensitive with scents, but likes to get massages!</li>
            <li>I think the price is a little high when I could probably get something better for cheaper</li>
            <li>Softens hard foot skin nicely.</li>
            <li>The smell was a little too strong for my tastes and very menthol-like.</li>
            <li>I thought the texture for a massage oil was just right - just enough slipperiness to keep his hands moving over my shoulders and neck without any tackiness or stickiness.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s definitely professional quality!</li>
            <li>She actually tried the product first</li>
            <li>All the ingredients are natural and so you are not rubbing a bunch of chemicals on your skin!  </li>
            <li>, he didn&#x27;t have to use as much, not constantly have to reapply, and not messy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got so far.</li>
            <li>Leaves the skin feeling soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>far, it&#x27;s helping too in that area.</li>
            <li>My massage recipient (female) really likes it.</li>
            <li>It absorbs in the skin completely.</li>
            <li>Anyways, it doesn&#x27;t leave the person receiving the massage oily, he said it just felt soft</li>
            <li>There are only a few scents that she can handle, and this one seems okay with her sensitive nose.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different massage oils while working as a massage therapist, but few stand out.  </li>
            <li>Personally I think adding a little more glide to the oil would take it to the next level.</li>
            <li>but it does get sticky pretty quick which makes it difficult to use for more than a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Just a little more glide would make the warming oils cover that much more with a little less effort, in effect making the massage last longer etc...</li>
            <li>My husband would normally just use lotion to massage my back.</li>
            <li>and at first she was laughing due to the name &amp;#34;Sensual.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Told</li>
            <li>I am a professional massage therapist and will be using this on my private clients.</li>
            <li>I received the item quicker than expected, thanks to amazon prime membership.</li>
            <li>As for the texture, it may looked thick but it&#x27;s silky smooth when you apply it on your skin</li>
            <li>Smooth and sensual for a night when you want to to take things slow</li>
            <li>I didnt think a 8oz bottle was going to last very long but with as much as it glides and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read other reviews and see that some folks really dig it</li>
            <li>Does not have the very greasy feelings that some other massage oil has.</li>
            <li>I did get a letter of the company&#x27;s owner saying that they are working on different scents on the near future.</li>

            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love a good massage.  </li>
            <li> It warms to touch, non sticky, absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t taste like anything so wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for that&lt;br /&gt;received discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review</li>
            <li> Goes on very easy.</li>
            <li> but it has a very strong earthly smell, I&#x27;ve return it.</li>
            <li> It is also very easy to wash off after apply.</li>
            <li> Nice aroma one of the better massage oils that I have used.</li>
            <li> and wow Im impressed with it.</li>
            <li> luckily for me, I actually love that kind of smell!</li>
            <li> Great product ;-)</li>
            <li> VERY SMOOTH WITH A THERAPEUTIC SCENT :-)</li>
            <li> This is more like a luxurious moisturizer than a massage oil.</li>
            <li> Interesting....</li>
            <li> She read the ingredients and she realized that most of the oil she uses is in the ingredients.</li>
            <li> Glad I tried this.</li>
            <li> Enjoying the product.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the massage oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I got this</li>
            <li> Makes you think like being in a spa session. :)</li>
            <li> Must be a girl thing! :-)</li>
            <li> I love the scent, the feel as it goes on.  </li>
            <li> I love the scent of this...</li>
            <li> Enjoyed the fragrance and the oil wasn&#x27;t sticky like some others.</li>
            <li> The skin stayed smooth even afterwards!</li>
            <li> love the feel of the oil</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> super nice frangrance and very easy to use as a massage oil.  </li>
            <li> She is yet to try it during a massage, but so far, so good!</li>
            <li> The scent is unique because you have so many wonderful essential oils in it......</li>
            <li> Fun.... Enjoyed!</li>
            <li> But I feel that this is overall a very good quality product</li>
            <li> Very enjoyable product ;)</li>
            <li> This massage oil has a very unique scent that I really enjoy.</li>
            <li> a long way!&lt;br /&gt;**I received this product to review and this review is 100% my own opinion!!</li>
            <li> It is silky soft and comes very nicely packaged.</li>
            <li> It is fragrant but not too strong.</li>
            <li> The smell was not too strong and the oil wasn&#x27;t sticky or pasty at all.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it lasts for a long time and it great to use on your partner.</li>
            <li> Adds an extra sensational feel!</li>
            <li> We both enjoyed it very much!</li>
            <li> I was impressed with the ingredients list: sunflower oil, grapeseed oil, safflower oil, rosehip oil and vitamins to name a few.</li>
            <li> This oil is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and goes on smoothly without feeling heavy or sticky...</li>
            <li> Awesome little product!</li>
            <li> I bought this for sexy time with my gf and was pretty dissappointed.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, my husband seems to think the smell is a bit stong, but I really enjoy it, very relaxing.</li>
            <li> all the other oils are good for skin care, I didn&#x27;t mind to put more on me.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling amazing, nourished and soft.</li>
            <li> I did a full body massage on a woman</li>
            <li> &amp; I think the smell is pretty strong; it almost reminds me of a scent you&#x27;d smell around Christmas time...</li>
            <li> It is nice on the skin and is smooth but yet, doesn&#x27;t feel all gross and greasy afterward.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs into skin fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> The smell is just a bit medicinal, but not unpleasant, and not over powering.</li>
            <li> Smells great, not very strong, my bf loves it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a very sultry and sexy scent, you might not like it at first but it will grow on you</li>
            <li> It simply does not get any better!  </li>
            <li> Unlike most other lubricants always leaves tacky feeling, it&#x27;s more like nutritious oil.</li>
            <li> It was strong at first, but slowly became pleasant and soothing.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very silky, especially when you rub your hands together to warm up the oil</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m pretty sure it is safe to get a little in your mouth</li>
            <li> Love the smell of all the essential oils!</li>
            <li> Can I really tell the world the fun?</li>
            <li> Was wanting a oil that got hot when using it and you barly notice the heat if at all when we used it.  </li>
            <li> helped put her in the mood for.... ;-)</li>
            <li> I love that you can order this online and get it is a traditional Amazon box.</li>
            <li> love the big bottle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for natural based massage oil for awhile, luckily I found this bottle.</li>
            <li> The ylang ylang is very prominent in the scent - there&#x27;s an overall Asian spiciness in the aroma.</li>
            <li> I use it for moisturizing, and it rubs in quickly, doesn&#x27;t ruin clothes and keeps my skin soft all day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pungent and some-what offensive and immediately gives me a headache.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Never got sticky and wasnt really oily when we were done.</li>
            <li> Really has relaxing, sensual feel and smell to it.</li>
            <li> Stimulate and smoothen the skin as you intimately connect with this Sensual Massage Oi</li>
            <li> High quality product!</li>
            <li> I really like this massage oil.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this oil for a couple of times I can say I really like it.</li>
            <li> It is very soothing and relaxing.</li>
            <li> the fragrance is very relaxing.</li>
            <li> it really doesnt take that much.</li>
            <li> I doesnt get real warn</li>
            <li> my boyfriend likes the smell so that&#x27;s really what matters</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant but not overwhelming, and a relatively small amount of oil is all that&#x27;s necessary for a good rubdown on any body part.  </li>
            <li> and I did her full back neck and sholders.</li>
            <li> Regular oil, its smell not bad at all</li>
            <li> This is a decent massage oil.</li>
            <li> Would definitely make it a better value as the oil would last longer.</li>
            <li> I gave this Massage oil to m mom who is very sensitive with scents, but likes to get massages!</li>
            <li> I think the price is a little high when I could probably get something better for cheaper</li>
            <li> Softens hard foot skin nicely.</li>
            <li> The smell was a little too strong for my tastes and very menthol-like.</li>
            <li> I thought the texture for a massage oil was just right - just enough slipperiness to keep his hands moving over my shoulders and neck without any tackiness or stickiness.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s definitely professional quality!</li>
            <li> She actually tried the product first</li>
            <li> All the ingredients are natural and so you are not rubbing a bunch of chemicals on your skin!  </li>
            <li> , he didn&#x27;t have to use as much, not constantly have to reapply, and not messy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got so far.</li>
            <li> Leaves the skin feeling soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> far, it&#x27;s helping too in that area.</li>
            <li> My massage recipient (female) really likes it.</li>
            <li> It absorbs in the skin completely.</li>
            <li> Anyways, it doesn&#x27;t leave the person receiving the massage oily, he said it just felt soft</li>
            <li> There are only a few scents that she can handle, and this one seems okay with her sensitive nose.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many different massage oils while working as a massage therapist, but few stand out.  </li>
            <li> Personally I think adding a little more glide to the oil would take it to the next level.</li>
            <li> but it does get sticky pretty quick which makes it difficult to use for more than a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Just a little more glide would make the warming oils cover that much more with a little less effort, in effect making the massage last longer etc...</li>
            <li> My husband would normally just use lotion to massage my back.</li>
            <li> and at first she was laughing due to the name &amp;#34;Sensual.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Told</li>
            <li> I am a professional massage therapist and will be using this on my private clients.</li>
            <li> I received the item quicker than expected, thanks to amazon prime membership.</li>
            <li> As for the texture, it may looked thick but it&#x27;s silky smooth when you apply it on your skin</li>
            <li> Smooth and sensual for a night when you want to to take things slow</li>
            <li> I didnt think a 8oz bottle was going to last very long but with as much as it glides and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews and see that some folks really dig it</li>
            <li> Does not have the very greasy feelings that some other massage oil has.</li>
            <li> I did get a letter of the company&#x27;s owner saying that they are working on different scents on the near future.</li>
            <li> This bottle has a pop up style cap so that has a small spout so you can regulate the fast pour of the thin-oil.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very thick oil that becomes sticky quickly</li>
            <li> Ylang Ylang Oil, Ginger, and other essential oils make up massage oil.  </li>
            <li> We have already discussed ordering another bottle, we have only used a little of this but do not want to get low.</li>
            <li> It is filled with cold pressed oils and essential oils.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not as slippery as other gel products, but it last longer since oil are harder to absorb.</li>
            <li> Certainly not &amp;#34;kissable&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> sometimes smell this too when I&#x27;m feeling nauseous due to my vertigo or use it to massage my temples.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel like it&#x27;s just like any other massage oil</li>
            <li> Other than the smell</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out on skin like some oils do after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> The texture is about average for massage oil</li>
            <li> If you and your partner give each other massages, (or want to try), give this oil a try!</li>
            <li> The bottle is small but a little bit goes a LONG way!</li>
            <li> he hated the &amp;#34;Christmas smell.&amp;#34; :)</li>
            <li> and I hardly used anything because just a few drops</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not overwhelming for me or for us.</li>
            <li> Not a very good scent.</li>
            <li> Thick oil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like a gel , it&#x27;s oil base</li>
            <li> &amp; I hate that smell with a passion!</li>
            <li> but my hands were disgusting.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is more like a luxurious moisturizer than a massage oil. Love the smell of all the essential oils!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for natural based massage oil for awhile, luckily I found this bottle. Unlike most other lubricants always leaves tacky feeling, it&#x27;s more like nutritious oil. The smell is great too, soothing and pleasant. Love it! Best massage oil I&#x27;ve got so far.</li>
            <li> A great product, scent ok, has a warming sensation which feels great, does not leave skin oily.</li>
            <li> By looking at the ingredients, I already know it&#x27;s like medicine and will work good for the muscle. Especially I like the ginger smell and all the other oils are good for skin care, I didn&#x27;t mind to put more on me. It&#x27;s not like a gel , it&#x27;s oil base so it&#x27;s not as slippery as other gel products, but it last longer since oil are harder to absorb. I like it , I take it to my massage place every time now.</li>
            <li> This oil smells so good! I was impressed with the ingredients list: sunflower oil, grapeseed oil, safflower oil, rosehip oil and vitamins to name a few. The bottle is small but a little bit goes a LONG way! Leaves skin feeling amazing, nourished and soft. Salon quality. I&#x27;m very impressed!</li>
            <li> This is a decent massage oil. The ylang ylang is very prominent in the scent - there&#x27;s an overall Asian spiciness in the aroma. I thought the texture for a massage oil was just right - just enough slipperiness to keep his hands moving over my shoulders and neck without any tackiness or stickiness. To me, it absorbs nicely into the skin. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a scent that I personally want on me all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my inspection and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> This oil is great! I use it for moisturizing, and it rubs in quickly, doesn&#x27;t ruin clothes and keeps my skin soft all day. The smell is just a bit medicinal, but not unpleasant, and not over powering. I actually like that it doesn&#x27;t smell like flowers, but if that&#x27;s your thing, this might not be what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> Very nice massage oul that just glides on.  It has a pleasant smell too.</li>
            <li> Interesting.... Fun.... Enjoyed!</li>
            <li> Bought this to give my honey a massage after a romantic dinner, and she loves the feel of this oil.  The scent is pleasant but not overwhelming, and a relatively small amount of oil is all that&#x27;s necessary for a good rubdown on any body part.  Delivery was great, and the seller was quite eager to get feedback about their product.  Overall, I&#x27;d definitely purchase this again when I run out, but given the size of the bottle I don&#x27;t expect that to be any time soon.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the results would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> The oil is not too greasy and not too tacky very pleasant. Leaves the skin feeling soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> Very nice oil, nice aromas all come together. it&#x27;s not just an oil, it&#x27;s an earthy experience. Personally I think adding a little more glide to the oil would take it to the next level. Would definitely make it a better value as the oil would last longer. Just a little more glide would make the warming oils cover that much more with a little less effort, in effect making the massage last longer etc...But I feel that this is overall a very good quality product</li>
            <li> This massage oil is amazing! It smells wonderful and goes on smoothly without feeling heavy or sticky...it&#x27;s definitely professional quality!</li>
            <li> Got it today and I was worried about one seller saying she/he hated the &amp;#34;Christmas smell.&amp;#34; :)&lt;br /&gt;But luckily for me, I actually love that kind of smell! I had my sis tried it and at first she was laughing due to the name &amp;#34;Sensual.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Told her her she doesn&#x27;t have to be! Lol! She read the ingredients and she realized that most of the oil she uses is in the ingredients. These Rosehip, Ylang-ylang, and grapeseed oil. She actually tried the product first and she loved that &amp;#34;spa-ish smell.&amp;#34; You can smell it but it&#x27;s not overwhelming for me or for us. As for the texture, it may looked thick but it&#x27;s silky smooth when you apply it on your skin and it&#x27;s not sticky or anything. Glad I tried this.</li>
            <li> Enjoying the product.</li>
            <li> This oil is fantastic. Great scent. Goes on very easy. Loved using it and so did the receiver.</li>
            <li> super nice frangrance and very easy to use as a massage oil.  All the ingredients are natural and so you are not rubbing a bunch of chemicals on your skin!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Regular oil, its smell not bad at all</li>
            <li> Smells Great. Thick oil. Very nice.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the massage oil. It was strong at first, but slowly became pleasant and soothing. My husband would normally just use lotion to massage my back. I&#x27;m so glad I got this, he didn&#x27;t have to use as much, not constantly have to reapply, and not messy.</li>
            <li> I like the oil quality but it has a very strong earthly smell, I&#x27;ve return it. I did get a letter of the company&#x27;s owner saying that they are working on different scents on the near future. I will try them as soon as they start selling them.</li>
            <li> Smooth and sensual for a night when you want to to take things slow</li>
            <li> I got this massage oil with plans to surprise my husband with a nice massage but I just cannot stomach the smell (and neither can he). It&#x27;s very pungent and some-what offensive and immediately gives me a headache. The texture is about average for massage oil but it does get sticky pretty quick which makes it difficult to use for more than a few minutes. I&#x27;ve read other reviews and see that some folks really dig it but this one is just not a product for me &amp; my hubby. *I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.*</li>
            <li> HE LOVED IT! VERY SMOOTH WITH A THERAPEUTIC SCENT :-)</li>
            <li> This massage oil feels great and smells great. Makes you think like being in a spa session. :)&lt;br /&gt;I sometimes smell this too when I&#x27;m feeling nauseous due to my vertigo or use it to massage my temples.&lt;br /&gt;So far, it&#x27;s helping too in that area.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Never got sticky and wasnt really oily when we were done. The smell reminded me of sandalwood; very pleasant.</li>
            <li> Very nice! Smells good and works great for the sensual massage!</li>
            <li> Great purchase! Adds an extra sensational feel!</li>
            <li> Really has relaxing, sensual feel and smell to it. The patchouli is the predominant fragrance. It soaks into your skin well, and is good on any part (except genitals, haven&#x27;t tried that and would be cautious about that) of your body. Softens hard foot skin nicely. My massage recipient (female) really likes it.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it lasts for a long time and it great to use on your partner.</li>
            <li> Very enjoyable product ;)</li>
            <li> Server as a moisturizer. essential oil blend.Stimulate and smoothen the skin as you intimately connect with this Sensual Massage Oi</li>
            <li> Smells and works great!</li>
            <li> Smells great!  Ylang Ylang Oil, Ginger, and other essential oils make up massage oil.  This bottle has a pop up style cap so that has a small spout so you can regulate the fast pour of the thin-oil.  It is nice on the skin and is smooth but yet, doesn&#x27;t feel all gross and greasy afterward.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend it!  *I received this item at a discount in return for an honest and unbiased review*</li>
            <li> Not warming like the label suggests and my wife got a rash from it. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> The massage oil is all that it is advertised to be. It is fragrant but not too strong. It starts out oily but does not stay that way.&lt;br /&gt;The customer service is AWESOME!</li>
            <li> Great smell!  Wonderfully errotic and sensual!  High quality product!</li>
            <li> I bought this for sexy time with my gf and was pretty dissappointed. It&#x27;s a very thick oil that becomes sticky quickly and it also smells like Christmas trees.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Nicely blended scents, yummy, not overpowering. Good quality oil for the skin.I am a professional massage therapist and will be using this on my private clients. This is good for any massage, &amp;#34;sensual&amp;#34; or not.</li>
            <li> Can I really tell the world the fun? Just imagine folks!</li>
            <li> I received the item quicker than expected, thanks to amazon prime membership. now come to oil, the oil is not too greasy and not too tacky very pleasant. Nice aroma one of the better massage oils that I have used. Smell too good.</li>
            <li> I really like this massage oil. My husband is always giving me massages and so I&#x27;m always looking for oils that don&#x27;t leave me oily, or make me break out.&lt;br /&gt;After using this oil for a couple of times I can say I really like it. I didn&#x27;t wake up feeling grimey, oily or like I needed a shower. It absorbs in the skin completely. No breakouts either. It smells great too. And a lot goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;**I received this product to review and this review is 100% my own opinion!!</li>
            <li> This oil is some of the beat I have ever used. The scent is invigorating and not over powering like some of the scented oils out there. One of the best features is that once applied you can leave it on to soak in which leaves your skin soft and pleasantly scented. My wife and I have even applied it after a bath without messaging it into the skin like an all-natural lotion. I would note that I would allow time for the product to soak in before going to bed however, as it can rub off onto your sheets if it has not fully soaked in.</li>
            <li> Wonderful. Pleasant on the skin with a nice aroma but not overpowering and no oily feeling afterwards. We would buy this again.</li>
            <li> This massage oil is great! I love the smell, my husband seems to think the smell is a bit stong, but I really enjoy it, very relaxing. Must be a girl thing! :-)</li>
            <li> This massage oil has a very unique scent that I really enjoy. It is very soothing and relaxing. Use it to massage sore muscles on yourself or someone else!</li>
            <li> Great idea for a gift!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get the hype over this product. I feel like it&#x27;s just like any other massage oil &amp; I think the smell is pretty strong; it almost reminds me of a scent you&#x27;d smell around Christmas time... &amp; I hate that smell with a passion! Anyways, it doesn&#x27;t leave the person receiving the massage oily, he said it just felt soft but my hands were disgusting. I think the price is a little high when I could probably get something better for cheaper but that&#x27;s just my opinion. I am just neutral about it!</li>
            <li> Was wanting a oil that got hot when using it and you barly notice the heat if at all when we used it.  It is a nice feeing oil</li>
            <li> Smells great and my wife loved the warming sensation that it gave off. helped put her in the mood for.... ;-)</li>
            <li> I gave this Massage oil to m mom who is very sensitive with scents, but likes to get massages! There are only a few scents that she can handle, and this one seems okay with her sensitive nose.  She is yet to try it during a massage, but so far, so good! Will update again once she has gone to her massage appointment!!! But the size is awesome as well as the packaging.  Awesome little product!</li>
            <li> This is good stuff, nice smell, not sticky. Absorbs into skin fairly quickly. Very good product, you won&#x27;t regret this buy.</li>
            <li> Not a very good scent. Certainly not &amp;#34;kissable&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful massage oil!  I have tried many different massage oils while working as a massage therapist, but few stand out.  This one does just that!  It is filled with cold pressed oils and essential oils. It simply does not get any better!  The scent is unique because you have so many wonderful essential oils in it......I love the scent, the feel as it goes on.  If you and your partner give each other massages, (or want to try), give this oil a try!</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this... the fragrance is very relaxing.</li>
            <li> Smell great and easy to apply to the body</li>
            <li> Smells great, not very strong, my bf loves it. Does not have the very greasy feelings that some other massage oil has. It is also very easy to wash off after apply.</li>
            <li> I saw this on Amazon and snagged it. It smells amazing!! I love that you can order this online and get it is a traditional Amazon box. It is silky soft and comes very nicely packaged. Great product ;-)</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love a good massage.  The smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> The smell is great and not overpowering. It warms to touch, non sticky, absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li> This oil is awesome, my wife and I love good massages. This oil has a really good smell and is very smooth when applied. It does not leave a oily residue like some of them have. We have already discussed ordering another bottle, we have only used a little of this but do not want to get low.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product!!! So happy and will be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> Would buy it again! Enjoyed the fragrance and the oil wasn&#x27;t sticky like some others. The skin stayed smooth even afterwards! We both enjoyed it very much!</li>
            <li> this stuff works great. I didnt think a 8oz bottle was going to last very long but with as much as it glides and streads out it really doesnt take that much. I did a full body massage on a woman and I hardly used anything because just a few drops and I did her full back neck and sholders. just a drop or 2 for each leg and foot and wow Im impressed with it. not to mention the warming side of it. I doesnt get real warn but it is just enough for what you need to get the job done.</li>
            <li> the scent of this oil is just like the &amp;#34;sensual&amp;#34; scent of the aromatherapy line at Bath and Body Works&lt;br /&gt;- it&#x27;s a very sultry and sexy scent, you might not like it at first but it will grow on you&lt;br /&gt;- love the feel of the oil, it&#x27;s very silky, especially when you rub your hands together to warm up the oil&lt;br /&gt;- my boyfriend likes the smell so that&#x27;s really what matters the most&lt;br /&gt;- love the big bottle so you can use enough and not be stingy with it&lt;br /&gt;- competitive pricing&lt;br /&gt;- wish it was edible, I&#x27;m pretty sure it is safe to get a little in your mouth but it doesn&#x27;t taste like anything so wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for that&lt;br /&gt;received discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review</li>
            <li> SMELLS GOOD AND WORK GOOD TOO</li>
            <li> I used this oil this weekend during  a surprise  spa night to my husband. The both of us love it! He loved the way it made his skin feel and so did I. I actually thought I was using a lot until I finished the massage and discovered I&#x27;d only used a fraction of this oil. The smell was not too strong and the oil wasn&#x27;t sticky or pasty at all. I love this product.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and rubs on skin easily.  Doesn&#x27;t dry out on skin like some oils do after a few minutes. It feels great on skin after warming up in your palms.</li>
            <li> The smell was a little too strong for my tastes and very menthol-like. Other than the smell it was awesome. We&#x27;re still going to use it but I will probably seek out a different fragrance/brand in the future.</li>
            <li> This makes for a great massage!</li>
