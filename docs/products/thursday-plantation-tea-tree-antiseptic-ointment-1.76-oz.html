            <li> this very good tea tree Ointment not bad to buy keep in home</li>
            <li> Thursdays Plantation Tea Tree Ointment is the only brand I use.  I have been using this Tea Tree Ointment for years on and off.  It help me get rid of my feet callus. It has many uses. Just check the internet if possible.  Great Product.</li>
            <li> This works very well and helps to heal quickly. Perfect for bug bites, small cuts, and scrapes. Just a little dab then rub it in. The smell isn&#x27;t that bad, not as strong smelling as full strength tea tree oil. It&#x27;s expensive but you don&#x27;t use a lot, just a little bit, so it will last a long time. Unless you&#x27;re accident prone.  ;-)</li>
            <li> WARNING! Thursday Plantation is NOT cruelty free. This company DOES test on animals!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and have used it for years.  I would unhesitatingly recommend it to everyone as a natural produict.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that this worked for others, however, in my case...I broke out in a rash that I&#x27;m still dealing with Two weeks later. There must be something in this ointment that I&#x27;m allergic to. I only wish that I could give it -1 stars.</li>
            <li> I have used tea tree oil as an oil in the past. This was my first time purchasing it in an ointment. I used it for a skin irritation for an 86 year old woman (skin irritation where skin is folded over on itself for long periods of time).  Unfortunately, after using it for 2 days, she got a red rash in the areas it was applied; it has gone away since I switched to using Calmoseptine on that area. I will keep it and try it for myself when I get a scratch or abrasion.</li>
            <li> Gave it to my son and he said it really works.</li>
            <li> Product shipped and arrived as advertised</li>
            <li> Works for mosquito allergy sufferers. almost instant relief</li>
            <li> I bought a tube of this while vacationing in Australia many years ago. I loved the product that I decided to buy more of it. I&#x27;m not sure what the difference between the one I bought years ago and this one, but the new version is much better than before</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Works well on insect bites.  We live in the south and have fire ants.  This really does help stop the pain.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years ever since discovering it while on vacation in Australia. Great for use on cuts and scrapes.</li>
            <li> Best at healing any skin irritation, cut or burn. Quickly heals wounds with no scarring or discoloration.  It&#x27;s my go to topical medicinal.</li>
            <li> I had a horrible rash under my breasts and I used this twice a day for a few weeks.  The rash is gone.  It does smell kind of funky...my husband said like Vicks. But it took away the rash with having to use harsh cortisone or other creams.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product I have used for a long time.  The &amp;#34;use until date&amp;#34; is always 2-3 YEARS from the time purchased.  This time, the vendor sent a product that was right up to the wire on expiration.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it though - just ask the seller what day it expires.</li>
            <li> Everyone needs to have some Tea Tree Ointment in the first aid kit or your medicine cabinet. Period.</li>
            <li> I use this on my mat burns in judo class to help from infection. So far, no infections after two years of use.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Great for itchy insect bites as soon as I use it it starts working right away and itching goes away. Marist bought it on a trip to Australia and can only find this brand here</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  I find that I heal so much faster using Tea Tree Ointment.  I even use it on mosquito bites and they stop bothering me within a day.  I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
