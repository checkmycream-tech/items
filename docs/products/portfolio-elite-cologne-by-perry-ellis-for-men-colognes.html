            <li> The item was not new, it should have been sealed in plastic.  Even though I cant tell by looking at it it is clearly apparent that the item is only half full.  Amazon should not be sending these out when they are customer returns.</li>
            <li> Nice, very good....Thank You....!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Nice scent, lasts an appropriate amount of time.</li>
            <li> oK THE WOMAN LOVE THIS SCENT BUY IT !</li>
            <li> Love this perfume, it&#x27;s been my favorite for years and still is. Too bad it&#x27;s hard to find in outlets these days which is why I turned to Amazon.</li>
            <li> Loves the smell of the scent but fragrance does not last long</li>
            <li> Does not last long even an hour. Will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I got this for my teenage son and he adores it.  The scent  is not too powerful and a little goes a long way.  Great cologne and nicely packaged.</li>
            <li> This is a great cologne at a cheap price! Musky and woody but also fresh if that makes sense. Makes a great evening or formal cologne. I wore it recently to a wedding and it seemed to suit the occasion perfectly.</li>
            <li> My wife is very pleased by the smell. There are also other people that mention they like it!  I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Picked this up as an impulse buy - it&#x27;s terrible. It is comparable to AXE in that its scent is intensely oppressive and immediately recognizable as cheap.</li>
            <li> Very nice and strong smell</li>
            <li> Smells very very cheap. Spray container is also cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> GF says she likes it but doesn&#x27;t even mention it so I assume she doesn&#x27;t care for it.  Decent smell, not fruity or girly.</li>
            <li> Delicious! Awesome price with Amazon Prime!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a big cologne user. My wife bought me one once but it ran out. I decided to take the plunge on this scent due to its description, price point, and reviews. I was not disappointed. It&#x27;s tough to describe smells, but if I was forced to I would say it smells like a barber shop in the middle of a wooded forest. Manly, bold, and thankfully not pretentious. My wife loves it as do my more sophisticated male friends. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Excellent shpping and service. The product was What I expected!</li>
            <li> I am very particular about fragrances, as I guess everyone is, since the fragrance has to blend with individual personal scents. So this review is obviously subjective. I really like this fragrance. It has a nice clean, masculine smell to it and it lasts all day. I took a chance without testing it in a store. Only two other fragrances have met my needs over the past 30 years... Hugo Boss and Gray Flannel. This is the third. I am very pleased and will buy it again. It is half the price of the high quality ones as well.</li>
