            <li>ok, but not working for me.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much I purchased another box for my mom</li>
            <li>this firming mask make my skin so smooth and shinning.</li>
            <li>it feels nice on your face leaves your skin soft .delivered</li>
            <li>Also, it dries up quickly.</li>
            <li>Smoothed and brightened my skin right away.</li>

            <li>I think My Beauty Diary is suitable for those who don&#x27;t have aging problems and only want to hydrate your skin.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t use this before starting my day which was a bummer because I love the glow and fresh  </li>
            <li>How crazy this may sound, it&#x27;s actually great at plumping the breasts!</li>
            <li>It also leaves your face feeling very soft and smooth afterward.</li>
            <li>Firstly the box that I bought for myself</li>
            <li>I am a female &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time trying the My beauty diary masks</li>
            <li>deffintly i will order for more in the future..</li>
            <li>THEY REALLY WORK !</li>
            <li>I would totally give the original box I got from amazon 5 stars!</li>
            <li>My skin was smooth and hyrdrated, pores seemed dimished and my face felt firm and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to give this mask 5 stars</li>
            <li>/&gt;YOU CAN REALLY SEE THE DIFFERENCE</li>
            <li>Smiles very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i like it very much.i</li>
            <li>Also, the material of the mask is thicker, totally different than the original one that I bought from the store before.</li>
            <li>For those who cannot read the boxes or don&#x27;t have English instructions, the masks are to be applied to clean skin and kept on for 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Here are the main differences...</li>
            <li>I wont be purchasing this particular mask  again but will try [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>The only reason I did not give 5 stars is I found better price at Asian supermarket for $12.49.</li>
            <li>my face was very oily more so than usual.  </li>
            <li>Great for the price, but not as wet initially as some other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li>So if you are like me and have moderate to severe oily skin this may not be the right mask for you.</li>
            <li>the Natto Mask and Collagen is my new try.</li>
            <li>This particular one always leaves my face glowing and soft.</li>
            <li>For me I have somewhat oily skin and large pores and upon my first time use I noticed an immediate difference that lasted for a few days.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t an uncomfortable kind of tightness, though.</li>

            <li> Love it! Leaves my face feeling refreshed and great!</li>
            <li> When I purchased this product the first time I was quite thrilled by the results! For me I have somewhat oily skin and large pores and upon my first time use I noticed an immediate difference that lasted for a few days.  My skin was smooth and hyrdrated, pores seemed dimished and my face felt firm and healthy.  I loved it so much I purchased another box for my mom but thats when I noticed the big difference.... Firstly the box that I bought for myself initately had the product text in the front of the box in Chinese whereares the second box was all in english. Even the packets inside featured the same difference in language.  But the second box(English Txt) is noticably inferior in quality that the first(chinese Txt).  Here are the main differences...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chinese box&lt;br /&gt;-Mask Material is thicker&lt;br /&gt;-Serum is more fragrant and also thickness is greater&lt;br /&gt;-Mask material is softer&lt;br /&gt;-Overall result is much more noticable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;English Box&lt;br /&gt;-Mask material is quite thin&lt;br /&gt;-almost no fragance&lt;br /&gt;-serum is watery&lt;br /&gt;-result is horrible compared to the prior&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can live without the fragrance as long as the product is doing its job but sadly the english box verison plan sucks... Not sure if there is a way to ask for just the chinese box verison but avoid the english box if possible. I would totally give the original box I got from amazon 5 stars!</li>
            <li> It is good for this price. I love the Natto Mask and Collagen is my new try. It&#x27;s as good as Natto. I think My Beauty Diary is suitable for those who don&#x27;t have aging problems and only want to hydrate your skin.</li>
            <li> The mask is very refreshing, great for large pores and excellent for moisturizing . I really wanted to give this mask 5 stars however it&#x27;s simply not 5 stars if you have oily skin. In my case I have severe oily skin, and this mask is VERY rich! I couldn&#x27;t use this before starting my day which was a bummer because I love the glow and fresh  look I get after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually put a mask on once a week right after my facial using [[ASIN:B0014P8L9W Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay Deep Pore Cleansing, 1 Pound]] before bed. I always noticed the following morning my face was very oily more so than usual.  So if you are like me and have moderate to severe oily skin this may not be the right mask for you. I wont be purchasing this particular mask  again but will try [[ASIN:B001R5U2UU President Pharmaceutical MY BEAUTY DIARY Black Pearl Mask 10pcs]] .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Writing this review under my Husband&#x27;s account for reference I am a female &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time trying the My beauty diary masks, i&#x27;ll let you know when I use them. They seem pretty good!</li>
            <li> Great product! Will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> The box printing that I received is different from what it is shown here. Also, the material of the mask is thicker, totally different than the original one that I bought from the store before. Also, it dries up quickly.</li>
            <li> I really love this mask. It does help with the collagen you can tell the difference. My best advice is to do it at night and you can see the difference in the am.</li>
            <li> Great quality mask! Smoothed and brightened my skin right away. I would recommend to all beauty lovers. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is I found better price at Asian supermarket for $12.49.</li>
            <li> I like this mask, it smells good and does what it says. I will buy it again and recommend it to my friends</li>
            <li> Not sure about firming. But it&#x27;s a great mask for a spa night at home</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Can&#x27;t speak for the firming aspect of the mask, but my face does look smoother and is softer after use.  I will cont. to use it.</li>
            <li> This is somewhat greasy compaired to other MBD masks.</li>
            <li> I am using these masks weekly.. It is effective..you can see the result immediately on your skin..thank you..deffintly i will order for more in the future..</li>
            <li> Great for the price, but not as wet initially as some other brands I have tried. Still a great product though!</li>
            <li> GET THIS DONE AT MY ESTICIAN .DECIDED TO GET SOME FOR HOME. THEY REALLY WORK !&lt;br /&gt;YOU CAN REALLY SEE THE DIFFERENCE</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t have sagging skin, I purchased this for the heck of trying it out from my Asian supermarket when they had a two for $25 deal for these masks. For those who cannot read the boxes or don&#x27;t have English instructions, the masks are to be applied to clean skin and kept on for 20 to 30 minutes. Any excess serum on your face after removing the mask is to be rubbed in and then you follow up with your usual skincare routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this mask, my face felt EXTREMELY firm. It wasn&#x27;t an uncomfortable kind of tightness, though. I approve of this for anyone having wrinkles or sagging skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may also be used on all skin types. I have oily skin and this did not cause any breakouts for me. It also leaves your face feeling very soft and smooth afterward.</li>
            <li> I love this mask! TFirst of all, want to say that this package was immidiately shipped after i paced an order. Thank you so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has  reasonable price, but very good quality. Smiles very good.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very sensitive, but this one never makes my face turn red or feel uncomfortable. I love it and i use it everyday while I am doing my assignment sitting in front of my computer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy more soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> How crazy this may sound, it&#x27;s actually great at plumping the breasts! I&#x27;m only 18 and my boobs needed some extra firmness/plumpness. All I did was tear the mask in half and apply it. I only used this once prior to massaging with extra virgin coconut oil and I saw some plumping effect and I can see a little bit of lift too. I can&#x27;t wait to use it again. Hopefully I&#x27;ll see even better results! :)</li>
            <li> I love this brand of masks! This particular one always leaves my face glowing and soft. Great gift as well!</li>
            <li> it feels nice on your face leaves your skin soft .delivered on time.I will continue to use the mask and see what happens.</li>
            <li> Does the job at the right price.</li>
            <li> this firming mask make my skin so smooth and shinning. i like it very much.i even recommend this product to my sister.</li>
            <li> This collagen mask is da bomb.&lt;br /&gt;This mask work on me good.&lt;br /&gt;I would like to re-purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;Price is good too.</li>
            <li> Everything about this mask is just amazing, the smell, texture...etc&lt;br /&gt;The results are great too, after using it my skin was softer than ever, I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> the product is not worth it.  it did not reach my expectations.  i would not recommend it to anyone. not worth the money.</li>
            <li> ok, but not working for me.</li>
    </ol>
