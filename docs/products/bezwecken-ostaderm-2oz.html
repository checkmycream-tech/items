            <li>The phyto B pellets worked wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>great product !!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>If you can find a way to measure out 1/4 tsp then it will be just great!</li>
            <li>I had been using PhytoB for four years and found it absolutely wonderful.  </li>
            <li>This company didn&#x27;t just \\&quot;discontinue\\&quot; the product (which is probably their best seller) for the heck of it...</li>

            <li>I was taking Phyto B in pill form which worked great.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff to use going through menopause.</li>
            <li>combine this product along with the PM Phytoestrogen tablets and they work great together.</li>
            <li>No one seems too happy with the OstaDerm</li>
            <li>This stuff is great.</li>
            <li>We are losing our rights as women to pick a great product that allows us to enjoy sex and have a balanced life!!!  </li>
            <li>OstaDerm was recommended to use in place of Phyto-B, but I did not find it to be nearly as good.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved them...</li>
            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for some time now and am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>It may have very slightly alleviated some of the symptoms, but doesn&#x27;t even come close to PhytoB!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>My naturopathic recommended it and was thrilled I can get it here too.</li>
            <li>Really does the job I feel great!!</li>
            <li>I love that both estrogen and progesterone in a good balance is in one cream.  </li>
            <li>No smell, nice texture.  </li>
            <li>I had great success with the Phyto-b but had to find an alternative when it was discontinued.  </li>
            <li>It works great and is well worth using.  </li>
            <li>I use Ostaderm cream along with Phyto B pellets, and this combination of products seems to be the perfect balance of natural hormone therapy replacement for me.</li>
            <li>This Is an excellent product to provide a natural way for hormone therapy.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who needs more energy and protection to their bones, It also calms me and makes me more loving person.</li>
            <li>This product has helped me greatly with hot flashes and night sweats.  </li>
            <li>I used Bezwecken&#x27;s Phyto B for about a year and had great relief from hot flashes.</li>
            <li>Gets better each day.  </li>
            <li>It sure doesn&#x27;t work the way</li>
            <li>I hope Beswecken comes out with a better product.</li>
            <li>Then like so many others have written it was discontinued.  </li>
            <li>but I like the OstaDerm-V better.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m taking synthetic hormones or those derived from my favorite animal, the horse.</li>
            <li>It seems to be the best match, but doesn&#x27;t quite do the same job.</li>
            <li>They said they took the &amp;#34;parabens out&amp;#34;, but it was much more than that</li>
            <li>I love the stuff.</li>
            <li>I was sceptible, at first , but decided to try the ladies in my Zumba class suggested it and how good the product works</li>
            <li>I was so excited and pleased with the results after using one bottle that I wanted to order a couple more immediately.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice not having hot flashes!</li>
            <li>what is becoming of this country?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>putting cream on is so easy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased it really works..</li>
            <li>I like this just fine</li>
            <li>She is a Christian doctor and is highly intelligent in regard to Women&#x27;s health.</li>
            <li>Great product, line and overall company.  </li>
            <li>KEEP BIG GOVERNMENT OUT of our lives and VAGINAS, so we can enjoy our FREEDOMS!!!</li>
            <li>Only thing I have tried that has helped my hot flashes and I have tried many many things !!</li>
            <li>I have had as many as 20 hot flashes in the day and 4-5 in the night.  </li>
            <li>I am still having many hot flashes every day.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It stopped the incontinence right away!  </li>
            <li>I have such good results with no menopausal symptoms at all.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d sure love to see the tablets come back.</li>
            <li>I am having night sweats and hot flashes during the day for the first time in four years!!  </li>
            <li>Immediately my hot flashes were gone!</li>
            <li>I REALLY miss the pellets, but this is a good second.</li>
            <li>I gave it a full month but got no relief from hot flashes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was recommended as a replacement for Phyto B, but is not anywhere near as potent as Phyto B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>identical replacement was putting me on the right track.</li>
            <li>The tablets were right on for me, this cream is not.  </li>
            <li>Apparently this company has discontinued a product that many women depended on.</li>
            <li>I rarely ever have a hot flash now.</li>
            <li>I find the recommended dose is not cutting the hot flashes unless I practically take a bath in it 3 times a day.  </li>
            <li>OTC natural progesterone creams are easy to come by.</li>
            <li>I am glad Amazon offers this product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Does not stop hot flashes</li>
            <li>I use it periodically when my hot flashes and night sweats get out of control.</li>
            <li>These products both work well for my hot flashes and help me sleep at night.  </li>
            <li>and it really works!</li>
            <li>First of all</li>
            <li>It has taken care of all my night sweats and hot flashes.  </li>
            <li>i do not have the same results with the cream, but it is better than nothing.</li>
            <li>Even though I use it as instructed, my hot flashes have returned and sex drive went</li>
            <li>It infuriates me that the FDA took away a simple, inexpensive, healthy remedy for menopause symptoms.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m back up to 24-26 days, which is better.</li>
            <li>For 10 years I&#x27;ve been trying EVERYTHING and nothing helped my hot flashes.</li>
            <li>It relieves hot flashes and insomnia for me.</li>
            <li>but it keeps those hot flashes at bay.</li>
            <li>It is no longer effective for my hot flashes, night sweats and the other symptoms for which I needed it.  </li>
            <li>It was my sister who introduced me to Phyto-B, and life quickly returned to normal.....</li>
            <li>A great and safe product is gone because the FDA is in bed with the big drug companies that do no good for Americans.  </li>
            <li>Between these two products, I am almost normal!!</li>
            <li>I really like this product and bought it when they stopped making the Phyto-B in tablet form, which is my first choice.  </li>
            <li>This coupled eoth 800 mgs of vitamin e really helps with hot flashes</li>
            <li>Bezwecken products are very high quality, and they work.</li>
            <li>I heard about this product from Dr. Helen Pensanti, who highly recommended it for menopausal women who had hot flashes and dryness.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend if you are having hot flashes, night sweats, insomnia, and or dryness.  </li>
            <li>The only downside is an inability to measure it accurately.</li>
            <li>AND IT REALLY DOES HELP WITH DRYNESS.</li>
            <li>Really helped me with the night sweats.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>really?  </li>
            <li>I used the recommended dosage in the beginning and it was too much...</li>
            <li>too fast...</li>
            <li>Any suggestions out there would be greatly appreciated.</li>
            <li>I was instructed to apply to fatty areas like thighs, upper arms for best results and alternate the application area each time.</li>
            <li>i do not use as much as recommended.</li>
            <li>I find it very useful, have been using it for several years.</li>
            <li>I use this as directed for hot flashes and it helps considerably!</li>
            <li>was looking for a natural way to help the hot flashes and this product worked for me.</li>
            <li>Since the FDA took Phyto B&#x27;s off the market I have searched for a combination of items that would naturally work together to alleviate hot flashes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I decided recently to search Amazon to see if they sold her products, and sure enough, they did.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>because I peeled off the new label and compared it to an older container.</li>
            <li>I was 36 and had to have a complete hysterectomy...ovaries and all which sent me straight into full-blown menopause.</li>
            <li>I stopped her cream after a few weeks cuz it was doing nothing, then tried getting more PhytoB.</li>
            <li>Our freedoms are becoming less and our decisions are being made for us...</li>
            <li>CAN&#x27;T LIVE WITHOUT THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>I guess I do know why as I&#x27;m sure Big Pharma spent lots of money lobbying to get Phyto-b taken off the market so women would think they had no option but to use their chemical and synthetic estrogens etc.  </li>
            <li>: This information is for educational purposes only.</li>
            <li>I was taking the Phyto-B pellets for 2 years and had finally found relief from night sweats, hot flashes, insomnia.....</li>
            <li>After YEARS of dealing with hot flashes I finally found a product that worked!  </li>
            <li>I felt my hot flashes returning shortly after using the OstaDerm cream.  </li>
            <li>My hot flashes are back.</li>
            <li>Be aware that this formula recently changed.  </li>
            <li>I am so disappointed that Phyto B has been discontinued; it worked perfectly for me.  </li>
            <li>my hot flashes are back.  </li>
            <li>Then, I let my body air dry so the cream is properly absorbed before getting dressed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even applied more than the recommended dose resulting in only slight relief.  </li>
            <li>I have been using OstaDerm for the last twelve years and it has really helped me.</li>
            <li>and leave in place something natural that has helped thousands of women, is unfathomable.  </li>
            <li>It is completely greaseless and absorbs into the skin within seconds.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been suffering with symptoms for nearly a year and they&#x27;re not decreasing.</li>
            <li>I was warned by friends to buy product directly from company.</li>
            <li>Clearly that hasn&#x27;t been the case for many and understandably they have given this product negative reviews as a way of voicing their displeasure.</li>
            <li>Not sure where to go from here, but it amazes me that the FDA has no problem endorsing products that can kill you, but found it necessary to remove a natural product that has helped so many women.</li>
            <li>I used to have a lot of hot flashes during the day, and wake up multiple times at night just drenched, but since using this cream on a regular basis both of those issues are nearly non-existant.</li>
            <li>Evidently, you have to be careful where you apply it (not on the abdomen, thighs or hip areas) because fat cells absorb and store estrogen, and your body has to develop estrogen receptors in the cells where you apply the cream.</li>
            <li>never had a problem with hot flashes or any other problem switching to them...</li>
            <li>Why the FDA, in its &amp;#34;infinite wisdom&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t go after companies like Monsanto, which is poisoning us (and the planet, in general) through our food supply with its manufacturing and selling of pesticides, GMO seeds, fungicides, herbicides, chemical fertilizers etc.</li>
            <li>Please consult with a professional health care provider before attempting anything that may constitute a change in your current health or lifestyle habits.</li>
            <li>i would prefer the pellets, but apparently they are off the market.</li>
            <li>I was on premarin for several years and decided to switch to these natural hormones.</li>
            <li>apply this cream to my inner thighs, belly, and inner arms straight out of the shower in the morning, when my pores are still open from the steam (just like the doctor directed me to do with the bio-identical cream).</li>
            <li>I tried this on my older dog who has had problems with incontinence as her previous owners had her spayed too young.  </li>
            <li>Prescribed by my Naturopath who explained that application to the skin (which I at first thought was a little lame) is far better than going thru the digestive system as with pills.</li>
            <li>It is messy and doesn&#x27;t keep the hot flashes at bay like the oral supplement.  </li>
            <li>A little pricey but worth it in the long run.</li>
            <li>I took the PhytoB for a few years and it totally got rid of my night sweats and hot flashes.</li>
            <li>I guess each day and wonder if I&#x27;m using too little or too much?  </li>

            <li> It has taken care of all my night sweats and hot flashes.  </li>
            <li> i do not have the same results with the cream, but it is better than nothing.</li>
            <li> Even though I use it as instructed, my hot flashes have returned and sex drive went</li>
            <li> It infuriates me that the FDA took away a simple, inexpensive, healthy remedy for menopause symptoms.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m back up to 24-26 days, which is better.</li>
            <li> For 10 years I&#x27;ve been trying EVERYTHING and nothing helped my hot flashes.</li>
            <li> It relieves hot flashes and insomnia for me.</li>
            <li> but it keeps those hot flashes at bay.</li>
            <li> It is no longer effective for my hot flashes, night sweats and the other symptoms for which I needed it.  </li>
            <li> It was my sister who introduced me to Phyto-B, and life quickly returned to normal.....</li>
            <li> A great and safe product is gone because the FDA is in bed with the big drug companies that do no good for Americans.  </li>
            <li> Between these two products, I am almost normal!!</li>
            <li> I really like this product and bought it when they stopped making the Phyto-B in tablet form, which is my first choice.  </li>
            <li> This coupled eoth 800 mgs of vitamin e really helps with hot flashes</li>
            <li> Bezwecken products are very high quality, and they work.</li>
            <li> I heard about this product from Dr. Helen Pensanti, who highly recommended it for menopausal women who had hot flashes and dryness.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you are having hot flashes, night sweats, insomnia, and or dryness.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is an inability to measure it accurately.</li>
            <li> AND IT REALLY DOES HELP WITH DRYNESS.</li>
            <li> Really helped me with the night sweats.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> really?  </li>
            <li> I used the recommended dosage in the beginning and it was too much...</li>
            <li> too fast...</li>
            <li> Any suggestions out there would be greatly appreciated.</li>
            <li> I was instructed to apply to fatty areas like thighs, upper arms for best results and alternate the application area each time.</li>
            <li> i do not use as much as recommended.</li>
            <li> I find it very useful, have been using it for several years.</li>
            <li> I use this as directed for hot flashes and it helps considerably!</li>
            <li> was looking for a natural way to help the hot flashes and this product worked for me.</li>
            <li> Since the FDA took Phyto B&#x27;s off the market I have searched for a combination of items that would naturally work together to alleviate hot flashes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I decided recently to search Amazon to see if they sold her products, and sure enough, they did.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> because I peeled off the new label and compared it to an older container.</li>
            <li> I was 36 and had to have a complete hysterectomy...ovaries and all which sent me straight into full-blown menopause.</li>
            <li> I stopped her cream after a few weeks cuz it was doing nothing, then tried getting more PhytoB.</li>
            <li> Our freedoms are becoming less and our decisions are being made for us...</li>
            <li> CAN&#x27;T LIVE WITHOUT THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I guess I do know why as I&#x27;m sure Big Pharma spent lots of money lobbying to get Phyto-b taken off the market so women would think they had no option but to use their chemical and synthetic estrogens etc.  </li>
            <li> : This information is for educational purposes only.</li>
            <li> I was taking the Phyto-B pellets for 2 years and had finally found relief from night sweats, hot flashes, insomnia.....</li>
            <li> After YEARS of dealing with hot flashes I finally found a product that worked!  </li>
            <li> I felt my hot flashes returning shortly after using the OstaDerm cream.  </li>
            <li> My hot flashes are back.</li>
            <li> Be aware that this formula recently changed.  </li>
            <li> I am so disappointed that Phyto B has been discontinued; it worked perfectly for me.  </li>
            <li> my hot flashes are back.  </li>
            <li> Then, I let my body air dry so the cream is properly absorbed before getting dressed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even applied more than the recommended dose resulting in only slight relief.  </li>
            <li> I have been using OstaDerm for the last twelve years and it has really helped me.</li>
            <li> and leave in place something natural that has helped thousands of women, is unfathomable.  </li>
            <li> It is completely greaseless and absorbs into the skin within seconds.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering with symptoms for nearly a year and they&#x27;re not decreasing.</li>
            <li> I was warned by friends to buy product directly from company.</li>
            <li> Clearly that hasn&#x27;t been the case for many and understandably they have given this product negative reviews as a way of voicing their displeasure.</li>
            <li> Not sure where to go from here, but it amazes me that the FDA has no problem endorsing products that can kill you, but found it necessary to remove a natural product that has helped so many women.</li>
            <li> I used to have a lot of hot flashes during the day, and wake up multiple times at night just drenched, but since using this cream on a regular basis both of those issues are nearly non-existant.</li>
            <li> Evidently, you have to be careful where you apply it (not on the abdomen, thighs or hip areas) because fat cells absorb and store estrogen, and your body has to develop estrogen receptors in the cells where you apply the cream.</li>
            <li> never had a problem with hot flashes or any other problem switching to them...</li>
            <li> Why the FDA, in its &amp;#34;infinite wisdom&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t go after companies like Monsanto, which is poisoning us (and the planet, in general) through our food supply with its manufacturing and selling of pesticides, GMO seeds, fungicides, herbicides, chemical fertilizers etc.</li>
            <li> Please consult with a professional health care provider before attempting anything that may constitute a change in your current health or lifestyle habits.</li>
            <li> i would prefer the pellets, but apparently they are off the market.</li>
            <li> I was on premarin for several years and decided to switch to these natural hormones.</li>
            <li> apply this cream to my inner thighs, belly, and inner arms straight out of the shower in the morning, when my pores are still open from the steam (just like the doctor directed me to do with the bio-identical cream).</li>
            <li> I tried this on my older dog who has had problems with incontinence as her previous owners had her spayed too young.  </li>
            <li> Prescribed by my Naturopath who explained that application to the skin (which I at first thought was a little lame) is far better than going thru the digestive system as with pills.</li>
            <li> It is messy and doesn&#x27;t keep the hot flashes at bay like the oral supplement.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey but worth it in the long run.</li>
            <li> I took the PhytoB for a few years and it totally got rid of my night sweats and hot flashes.</li>
            <li> I guess each day and wonder if I&#x27;m using too little or too much?  </li>
            <li> My got flashes are much less intense and  less frequent.</li>
            <li> OTC natural estrogen creams, on the other hand, are not.</li>
            <li> Then the FDA made them change the formula and now after 20 years I am having hot flashes day and night and all the other little miseries that go along with them.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle, but I&#x27;m no longer getting night sweats and heavy breasts (which were becoming excruciating), and my periods have also balanced out a bit.</li>
            <li> they want us ladies to go back taking their formulas that cause cancer and other medical problems.  </li>
            <li> I should have written this a long time ago as I have been on it for years</li>
            <li> I can only recommend this product as an alternative to the PhytoB pellets because I don&#x27;t know of any other product on the market that has at least a minimal effect on my hot flashes.</li>
            <li> Maybe it will work in time, but I&#x27;m not impressed so far and really miss the Phyto B tablets that worked so well.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re just starting out with natural hormone therapy replacement, it typically takes a few weeks before you start noticing relief of symptoms, so don&#x27;t think they don&#x27;t work if nothing happens after just a couple days.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 20 years and could not live without it.</li>
            <li> natural hormone balancing, use as little as little as possible to acquire the desired results.</li>
            <li> No particular odor.</li>
            <li> I have used Bezwecken products for years, and typically have ordered them regularly through my Naturopath.</li>
            <li> each time is harder to try and figure out than popping a pellet.  </li>
            <li> It only takes a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Finally a product that helped within a few days.</li>
            <li> I have been taking this cream for the last few weeks in place of the Phyto B and</li>
            <li> I used this product years ago and had to give it up due to skin irritation.</li>
            <li> My review is for the woman that never used the other product and is searching for some relief.</li>
            <li> If you experience hot flashes, night sweats, foggy thinking, low energy, depressed mood, vaginal dryness, decreased concentration and/or decreased libido, you may want to increase the dosage.</li>
            <li> Not worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> I tried for 2 years to find a hormone replacement that actually worked without any side effects, i.e. Swollen, painful legs, anxiety, no sex drive, hot flashes, heart flutters.  </li>
            <li> I always had a 28 day cycle, but had gone down to 21 days.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t due without it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 46 and have been struggling with various perimenopausal symptoms since my late 30s: night sweats; heavy, tender, swollen breasts; and fatigue,</li>
            <li> Tried the OstaDerm cream and my hot flashes are back, insomnia, that annoying dryness, etc.  </li>
            <li> 2mg daily (approximately 1/2 tsp)</li>
            <li> 1mg daily (approximately 1/4 tsp)</li>
            <li> Found it worked after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> so I won&#x27;t waste my money.</li>
            <li> tried doctor prescribed bio-identicals a couple of years ago and found them to be too heavy.</li>
            <li> They actually made my symptoms worse - maybe it was too soon?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, I was taking the pellets until they went off the market and bought this cream.  </li>
            <li> No more hotflashes.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, should you develop agitation, panic attacks, weight gain (abdominal or thighs), water retention, headaches, poor sleep, swollen or tender breasts, bloating, spotting or breakthrough bleeding, you may need to decrease the dosage or add additional milligrams of progesterone via another product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer</li>
            <li> My flashes are less than they were before but worse than when I took the pellets.  </li>
            <li> so I urge you to order at least six months at a time</li>
            <li> Then.......duh, duh, duh.....</li>
            <li> Within a few days I was waking all night kicking the covers off and getting up exhausted.</li>
            <li> My Naturopath recommended a very small amount am and pm working</li>
            <li> Too bad they can&#x27;t notify their users when they make such a drastic change.  </li>
            <li> Not overpowering, but not great either.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product twice and twice I have received the wrong product.</li>
            <li> What a waste of my money and very expensive, used it for 3 weeks until I started breaking out!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a cream not a pellet which is a turn off and inconvenient.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical!  </li>
            <li> I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Soooo disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Some stupid doctor I saw</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> being the worst of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Nasty stuff.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was sceptible, at first , but decided to try the ladies in my Zumba class suggested it and how good the product works and I defiantly agree and can&#x27;t wait to pass the word on . I&#x27;m very pleased it really works..</li>
            <li> OTC natural progesterone creams are easy to come by. OTC natural estrogen creams, on the other hand, are not. This product contains over-the-counter OTC estrogen in the ratio 20% E2 (Estradiol, 80% E3 (Estriol). 2mg daily (approximately 1/2 tsp) provides 66mg Progesterone + 0.4mg E2, Estradiol and 1.6mg E3, Estriol. 1mg daily (approximately 1/4 tsp) provides 33mg Progesterone + 1mg Biest, which is 0.2mg E2, Estradiol and 0.8mg E3, Estriol. 1/2mg (1/8 tsp) provides 17mg Progesterone + 0.1 E2 Estradiol + 0.4 E3, Estriol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For natural hormone balancing, use as little as little as possible to acquire the desired results. If you experience hot flashes, night sweats, foggy thinking, low energy, depressed mood, vaginal dryness, decreased concentration and/or decreased libido, you may want to increase the dosage. OstraDerm recommends using 1/4 teaspoon two to three times daily. On the other hand, should you develop agitation, panic attacks, weight gain (abdominal or thighs), water retention, headaches, poor sleep, swollen or tender breasts, bloating, spotting or breakthrough bleeding, you may need to decrease the dosage or add additional milligrams of progesterone via another product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: This information is for educational purposes only.

            <li> I used this product years ago and had to give it up due to skin irritation. I found the alternative in the pellets and those have been discontinued.  Now I&#x27;m back to the cream.  I hope changes have been made to prevent skin irritations.  It&#x27;s nice not having hot flashes!</li>
            <li> It does not do the job as advertised.  Does not stop hot flashes......  Phyto B pellets worked great, however, they are no longer made.</li>
            <li> I was taking the Phyto-B pellets for 2 years and had finally found relief from night sweats, hot flashes, insomnia.....I could not believe they took this off the market.  Tried the OstaDerm cream and my hot flashes are back, insomnia, that annoying dryness, etc.  Not sure where to go from here, but it amazes me that the FDA has no problem endorsing products that can kill you, but found it necessary to remove a natural product that has helped so many women.</li>
            <li> I heard about this product from Dr. Helen Pensanti, who highly recommended it for menopausal women who had hot flashes and dryness. I have been using OstaDerm for the last twelve years and it has really helped me. It is a must have on hand product so I urge you to order at least six months at a time so you don&#x27;t run out. If you want to know details about it, go to her website and read what she says. She is a Christian doctor and is highly intelligent in regard to Women&#x27;s health.</li>
            <li> The phyto B pellets worked wonderfully.  This product doesn&#x27;t even come close to the pellets and the container does not seem to be enough to last as stated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure wonder why they discontinued the pellets.</li>
            <li> great product !!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I could tell a difference almost immediately.  Gets better each day.  Wasn&#x27;t expecting a non-prescription product to work this well.  The Phyto-B pellets were recommended but since all of the pellet products contain lactose I needed to use the cream.  Highly recommend if you are having hot flashes, night sweats, insomnia, and or dryness.  Great product.</li>
            <li> CAN&#x27;T LIVE WITHOUT THIS PRODUCT. MY BONE DENSITY TEST CAME BACK IMPROVED SINCE USING THIS REGULARLY. AND IT REALLY DOES HELP WITH DRYNESS.</li>
            <li> This product helps me to remain myself.  My got flashes are much less intense and  less frequent. My moods are even. I can   tell the difference when I do not apply  the OstaDerm.</li>
            <li> I REALLY miss the pellets, but this is a good second. I also use the liquid form that replaced the pellets. Between these two products, I am almost normal!!</li>
            <li> I really like this product and bought it when they stopped making the Phyto-B in tablet form, which is my first choice.  It works just as well. The only downside is an inability to measure it accurately. I guess each day and wonder if I&#x27;m using too little or too much?  If you can find a way to measure out 1/4 tsp then it will be just great!</li>
            <li> I had great success with the Phyto-b but had to find an alternative when it was discontinued.  I have been using Ostaderm for about four weeks. To some degrees, my menopausal symptoms have returned. It sure doesn&#x27;t work the way Phyto-b did plus I find that my breasts are tender and sore. Why the FDA, in its &amp;#34;infinite wisdom&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t go after companies like Monsanto, which is poisoning us (and the planet, in general) through our food supply with its manufacturing and selling of pesticides, GMO seeds, fungicides, herbicides, chemical fertilizers etc. and leave in place something natural that has helped thousands of women, is unfathomable.  WelI, I guess I do know why as I&#x27;m sure Big Pharma spent lots of money lobbying to get Phyto-b taken off the market so women would think they had no option but to use their chemical and synthetic estrogens etc.  I hope Beswecken comes out with a better product.</li>
            <li> My gynecologist took me off estrogen a while back and said she had no objection to products up this alley to potentially deal with girl symptoms of later life.  I gave it the college try and didn&#x27;t see any benefit.  It&#x27;s easy to apply.  No particular odor.</li>
            <li> Only thing I have tried that has helped my hot flashes and I have tried many many things !!&lt;br /&gt;I had been on hormone replacement for years and had to stop taking so was looking for a natural way to help the hot flashes and this product worked for me.</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do. I&#x27;ve used this for couple years off and on. don&#x27;t need it all the time now.</li>
            <li> I had been using PhytoB for four years and found it absolutely wonderful.  Then like so many others have written it was discontinued.  I have tried the OstaDerm and it is not helping at all.  I am having night sweats and hot flashes during the day for the first time in four years!!  I am going to try the liquid form that has been brought out - PhytoB-L and hopefully it will work.</li>
            <li> OstaDerm was recommended to use in place of Phyto-B, but I did not find it to be nearly as good.</li>
            <li> I was taking Phyto B in pill form which worked great.  The cream form does not have the same effect.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to get into my system through my skin.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd tube of OstaDerm I&#x27;ve used.  Kept hoping it would kick in! No such luck!  After they stopped selling PhytoB my menopausal symptoms came back with a vengeance!  At Bezwecken&#x27;s recommendation, I tried OstaDerm.  It may have very slightly alleviated some of the symptoms, but doesn&#x27;t even come close to PhytoB!  Please, please bring it back!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I use it periodically when my hot flashes and night sweats get out of control. I like the idea that I can use it sparingly and still get some relief. Apparently this company has discontinued a product that many women depended on. It appears they were told that  OstaDerm cream is a comparable option. Clearly that hasn&#x27;t been the case for many and understandably they have given this product negative reviews as a way of voicing their displeasure. I hope the manufacturer is listening. My review is for the woman that never used the other product and is searching for some relief.</li>
            <li> I tried this cream alone and also in conjunction with Estrovera.  I gave it a full month but got no relief from hot flashes.</li>
            <li> I like this just fine but I like the OstaDerm-V better.  This has a medicinal smell.  Not overpowering, but not great either.  These products both work well for my hot flashes and help me sleep at night.  Easy to use and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m taking synthetic hormones or those derived from my favorite animal, the horse.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and it really works! A little pricey but worth it in the long run.</li>
            <li> Not worth the purchase. Really helped me with the night sweats. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Feels gritty and couldn&#x27;t tell the</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do!  It was recommended by a naturopath.  I find it very useful, have been using it for several years.</li>
            <li> Great stuff to use going through menopause. Found it worked after a few weeks. My naturopathic recommended it and was thrilled I can get it here too. Wish it came in a larger tube</li>
            <li> This product has helped me greatly with hot flashes and night sweats.  It works great and is well worth using.  I have had as many as 20 hot flashes in the day and 4-5 in the night.  I rarely ever have a hot flash now.</li>
            <li> Since the FDA took Phyto B&#x27;s off the market I have searched for a combination of items that would naturally work together to alleviate hot flashes.&lt;br /&gt;I combine this product along with the PM Phytoestrogen tablets and they work great together.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.  I am still having many hot flashes every day.&lt;br /&gt;It was recommended as a replacement for Phyto B, but is not anywhere near as potent as Phyto B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sweating in MIchigan</li>
            <li> After YEARS of dealing with hot flashes I finally found a product that worked!  I was so excited and pleased with the results after using one bottle that I wanted to order a couple more immediately.  Of course, because I found a product that actually delivered on the promise it made, it was discontinued.  Instead of the PhytoB pellets I was encouraged to use the Bezwecken OstaDerm Cream as a replacement.  First of all it&#x27;s a cream not a pellet which is a turn off and inconvenient.  Instructing me to use 1/4 of a tsp. each time is harder to try and figure out than popping a pellet.  I felt my hot flashes returning shortly after using the OstaDerm cream.  They did not return with the vengeance of before but I attributed that to residual effects of the pellets. My flashes are less than they were before but worse than when I took the pellets.  I can only recommend this product as an alternative to the PhytoB pellets because I don&#x27;t know of any other product on the market that has at least a minimal effect on my hot flashes.</li>
            <li> Allergic to something in it and they wouldn&#x27;t work with me!!!!!!!  HAVE NO PLANS TO BUY ANYTHING FROM THEM AGAIN.</li>
            <li> I used Bezwecken&#x27;s Phyto B for about a year and had great relief from hot flashes. For some reason, Bezwecken discontinued Phyto B and say this replaces it. It seems to do nothing and I&#x27;ve used it for three weeks now. My hot flashes are back. There are no instructions for applying this cream, so I looked it up on line. Evidently, you have to be careful where you apply it (not on the abdomen, thighs or hip areas) because fat cells absorb and store estrogen, and your body has to develop estrogen receptors in the cells where you apply the cream. Maybe it will work in time, but I&#x27;m not impressed so far and really miss the Phyto B tablets that worked so well.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous estrogen and progesterone supplements from pills to creams and finally came across this.  It has taken care of all my night sweats and hot flashes.  No side effects or headaches like others I have tried.  It is completely greaseless and absorbs into the skin within seconds.  I should have written this a long time ago as I have been on it for years and I hope it will help someone.</li>
            <li> i would prefer the pellets, but apparently they are off the market. i do not have the same results with the cream, but it is better than nothing.</li>
            <li> Great product, line and overall company.  Been using this product since PhytoB was \\&quot;discontinued\\&quot;.  When I say \\&quot;discontinued\\&quot; I ask all the women out there who are upset PhytoB is gone to wake up!!! This company didn&#x27;t just \\&quot;discontinue\\&quot; the product (which is probably their best seller) for the heck of it... Thanks to the growing government and ballooning of regulations under Obama; they have clearly been forced by the FDA to stop manufacturing.  A great and safe product is gone because the FDA is in bed with the big drug companies that do no good for Americans.  Please wake up ladies and pay attention to who you vote for!!! We are losing our rights as women to pick a great product that allows us to enjoy sex and have a balanced life!!!  KEEP BIG GOVERNMENT OUT of our lives and VAGINAS, so we can enjoy our FREEDOMS!!!</li>
            <li> This item replaces the oral supplement discontinued by Bezwecken, per FDA regulations.  It is messy and doesn&#x27;t keep the hot flashes at bay like the oral supplement.  It seems to be the best match, but doesn&#x27;t quite do the same job.</li>
            <li> This is the best!! No more hotflashes. Really does the job I feel great!! putting cream on is so easy.</li>
            <li> This cream has replaced $100 a month of bioidentical compounded cream and the every 6 months $700 testing.  I was skeptical!  For $30 a tube which lasts 4+ months...really?  It works beautifully.  I love that both estrogen and progesterone in a good balance is in one cream.  I used the recommended dosage in the beginning and it was too much...too fast...I felt depressed.  My Naturopath recommended a very small amount am and pm working</li>
            <li> I have used Bezwecken products for years, and typically have ordered them regularly through my Naturopath. I decided recently to search Amazon to see if they sold her products, and sure enough, they did. I use Ostaderm cream along with Phyto B pellets, and this combination of products seems to be the perfect balance of natural hormone therapy replacement for me. Bezwecken products are very high quality, and they work. If you&#x27;re just starting out with natural hormone therapy replacement, it typically takes a few weeks before you start noticing relief of symptoms, so don&#x27;t think they don&#x27;t work if nothing happens after just a couple days.

            <li> I took the PhytoB for a few years and it totally got rid of my night sweats and hot flashes. Some stupid doctor I saw last May told me to stop taking it and put me on some cream. Within a few days I was waking all night kicking the covers off and getting up exhausted. I stopped her cream after a few weeks cuz it was doing nothing, then tried getting more PhytoB. I couldn&#x27;t believe I couldn&#x27;t get it anymore! I&#x27;ve been suffering with symptoms for nearly a year and they&#x27;re not decreasing. I&#x27;m 64. I don&#x27;t know what to try. No one seems too happy with the OstaDerm so I won&#x27;t waste my money. Any suggestions out there would be greatly appreciated.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. Prescribed by my Naturopath who explained that application to the skin (which I at first thought was a little lame) is far better than going thru the digestive system as with pills. I was instructed to apply to fatty areas like thighs, upper arms for best results and alternate the application area each time.</li>
            <li> I was 36 and had to have a complete hysterectomy...ovaries and all which sent me straight into full-blown menopause. I tried for 2 years to find a hormone replacement that actually worked without any side effects, i.e. Swollen, painful legs, anxiety, no sex drive, hot flashes, heart flutters.  I even tried the Wiley Protocol for quite sometime with some improvement, so I know bio identical replacement was putting me on the right track. It was my sister who introduced me to Phyto-B, and life quickly returned to normal.....no more hot flashes, heart flutters, anxiety, and my sex drive was back!  Then.......duh, duh, duh.....the FDA swooped in and took away our salvation!  Ostraderm IS NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR PHYTO-B!!!!!!  Even though I use it as instructed, my hot flashes have returned and sex drive went bye-bye.  I am so disappointed. It infuriates me that the FDA took away a simple, inexpensive, healthy remedy for menopause symptoms.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 20 years and could not live without it.</li>
            <li> I was on premarin for several years and decided to switch to these natural hormones. I absolutely loved them...never had a problem with hot flashes or any other problem switching to them...even lost some weight that I had gained from the premarin. Then the FDA made them change the formula and now after 20 years I am having hot flashes day and night and all the other little miseries that go along with them.  I guess the big pharmaceutical companies weren&#x27;t making enough money...they want us ladies to go back taking their formulas that cause cancer and other medical problems.  Our freedoms are becoming less and our decisions are being made for us... what is becoming of this country?</li>
            <li> Be aware that this formula recently changed.  It is no longer effective for my hot flashes, night sweats and the other symptoms for which I needed it.  I was on this product for years.  Now, I am searching for an alternative.  Too bad they can&#x27;t notify their users when they make such a drastic change.  They said they took the &amp;#34;parabens out&amp;#34;, but it was much more than that because I peeled off the new label and compared it to an older container.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 46 and have been struggling with various perimenopausal symptoms since my late 30s: night sweats; heavy, tender, swollen breasts; and fatigue, being the worst of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried doctor prescribed bio-identicals a couple of years ago and found them to be too heavy. They actually made my symptoms worse - maybe it was too soon?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m about to order my 4th tube of OstaDerm. I love the stuff. It&#x27;s subtle, but I&#x27;m no longer getting night sweats and heavy breasts (which were becoming excruciating), and my periods have also balanced out a bit. I always had a 28 day cycle, but had gone down to 21 days. Who needs a period every 3 weeks? Especially with the PMS symptoms I was experiencing. Now I&#x27;m back up to 24-26 days, which is better. Hopefully it will last for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply this cream to my inner thighs, belly, and inner arms straight out of the shower in the morning, when my pores are still open from the steam (just like the doctor directed me to do with the bio-identical cream). Then, I let my body air dry so the cream is properly absorbed before getting dressed. It only takes a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck to all.</li>
            <li> I tried this on my older dog who has had problems with incontinence as her previous owners had her spayed too young.  It stopped the incontinence right away!  No smell, nice texture.  (I put a dab on her inner leg per the vet&#x27;s instructions)  Good value.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, I was taking the pellets until they went off the market and bought this cream.  What a waste of my money and very expensive, used it for 3 weeks until I started breaking out!  Nasty stuff.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t due without it!</li>
            <li> For 10 years I&#x27;ve been trying EVERYTHING and nothing helped my hot flashes. Finally a product that helped within a few days. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This Is an excellent product to provide a natural way for hormone therapy. It relieves hot flashes and insomnia for me.</li>
            <li> used phyto B for a while...sad that it was discontinuted...this was recommended...did not take care of menapausal symptoms like phyto B.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed that Phyto B has been discontinued; it worked perfectly for me.  I have been taking this cream for the last few weeks in place of the Phyto B and my hot flashes are back.  Soooo disappointed.</li>
            <li> Received product but it was not what I ordered. I ordered Ostaderm Transdemal but instead I got the Ostaderm Moisture. The ingredients on the back had a label placed over it with different ingredients on the back. I was warned by friends to buy product directly from company.</li>
            <li> I use this as directed for hot flashes and it helps considerably!</li>
            <li> In very happy with this cream.  I apply it to both outer upper arms, inner thighs, and lower abdomen.  It works best for me by applying it in morning and evening before bedtime</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who needs more energy and protection to their bones, It also calms me and makes me more loving person.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product twice and twice I have received the wrong product.</li>
            <li> This product has had to be used since the company stopped making the tablets.  The tablets were right on for me, this cream is not.  I find the recommended dose is not cutting the hot flashes unless I practically take a bath in it 3 times a day.  I&#x27;ve even applied more than the recommended dose resulting in only slight relief.  I&#x27;d sure love to see the tablets come back.</li>
            <li> I used to have a lot of hot flashes during the day, and wake up multiple times at night just drenched, but since using this cream on a regular basis both of those issues are nearly non-existant.</li>
            <li> I have been using OstaDerm through my doctor&#x27;s recommendation for 10 years.  I have such good results with no menopausal symptoms at all.  It is a perfect balance for me.  I am glad Amazon offers this product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me...I was disappointed. Will not purchase again....</li>
            <li> I love this product! Immediately my hot flashes were gone! I have been using this product for some time now and am very pleased with it. I would recommend it to anyone !</li>
            <li> This coupled eoth 800 mgs of vitamin e really helps with hot flashes</li>
            <li> I am past menopause but still get the hot flashes. i do not use as much as recommended. Just 1/4 tsp a day but it keeps those hot flashes at bay. My doctor recommended this product.</li>
