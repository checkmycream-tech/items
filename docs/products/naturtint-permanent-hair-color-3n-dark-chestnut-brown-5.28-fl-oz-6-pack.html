            <li>My hair looks &amp; feels amazing , vibrant &amp; healthier .</li>
            <li>What more could i say thank you very much.</li>
            <li>Have been using this brand and color 3N to match my original hair color and to cover gray roots.</li>
            <li>Love it that has no allergic reaction and seems gentle on my scalp.</li>
            <li>I&#x60;m 32 years and full gray.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>Product was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a semi-permenant hair color product at first because I wanted something that is ammonia free.  </li>
            <li>My hair has never been dry, and I&#x27;ve colored it off and on for many, many years.  </li>
            <li>I originally found this hair dye at Whole Foods because I was looking for an ammonia-free hair dye to use while I was pregnant.</li>
            <li>Affordable, fast, &amp; accurate order.</li>
            <li>Just went to more natural hair dye.</li>
            <li>I have used this brand for years and love the natural colour it gives me.</li>
            <li>Have tried many lines, including professional color before.</li>
            <li>we can check all the ingredient and be surprised that even it this  is the most healthy and natural hair dye on the market it still includes 3 very harmful ingredient .:-</li>
            <li>I already had been buying this brand from a local store (Whole Foods) and liked the idea of a more natural hair color.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle, but gets the job done.</li>
            <li>A friend had recommended this product and it had worked really well for me!</li>
            <li>No chemical and not irritating to the skin at all!</li>
            <li>is way cheaper than buying it at Whole Foods!</li>
            <li>Unfortunatly I tought like a  lots of us here thinking about this product that is chemichal free and 100 % natural</li>
            <li>I got 6 pack before and the quality and amount of products in each box was exactly how it should be.</li>
            <li>I love the colour for a Asian girl.</li>
            <li>The product is great and the cost is less if you buy it direct.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve started using it, I have been getting complimented on how nice my hair looks, and it actually works better than any other brand I have used.</li>
            <li>The color was soft and rich, and did not fade.</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s hard to see how they can improve on this near perfect product--maybe use 100% natural ingredients?  </li>
            <li>Simply put, this product does not permanently dye gray hairs and can/will wash out somewhat easily.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Naturtint since I was pregnant with my 4 year old.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this hair color for years and buying them one box at a time from Whole Foods for about $18 each.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, as described</li>
            <li>Very affordable buying it  </li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li>and it really lowers the price per unit.</li>
            <li>Then I came across this product at Whole Food.  </li>
            <li>Shipping fast and priced very competitively</li>
            <li>The color stays for much longer.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn her scalp, and leaves her hair feeling and looking the way she wants it</li>
            <li>and this works very well.  </li>
            <li>have mixed several colors of Naturtint over the years, creating my own shades.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, and the color lasts long.</li>
            <li>I love the product because it doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate my scalp like other hair colors.</li>
            <li>The color stays true as well and doesn&#x27;t start to fade or turn red after a while.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This natural dye really does do the trick.</li>
            <li>The color came out very close to my natural born color.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why the store marked it up so much.</li>
            <li>exactly what she wants cheaper than at the local drug store.</li>
            <li>This is my second time ordering the 6 pack, and I plan to continue since it is economical.</li>
            <li>Each application lasts about 8 shampoos for me and adequately covers my grey.</li>
            <li>- you get a nice, even glossy color that lasts pretty well or at least comparable to commercial colors.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very natural looking,</li>
            <li>No more drugstore dyes, although would like more color choices.</li>
            <li>Have tried other local brand names before for many years.  </li>
            <li>However, my hair was in good condition before I colored it; since then, it&#x27;s been extremely dry, with lots of flyaways and frizz, tangles both dry and wet, no matter what I do.  </li>
            <li>not completely chemical free but a lot less toxic than most other hair dyes.</li>
            <li>is my favorite dye because it left my hair looking like a natural black.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Firstly, my review does not touch on whether or not the product is truly natural.  </li>
            <li>As the old adage goes, something&#x27;s gotta give.</li>
            <li>They shouldn&#x27;t have marked it up to that degree, and I would have continued purchasing it there.</li>
            <li>I use one every six weeks because it all natural.</li>
            <li>All natural, covers the gray.</li>
            <li>My husband said it look like my natural hair color.</li>
            <li>There are no harsh smells or chemicals.</li>
            <li>Gives you a natural look.</li>
            <li>The right color fits me and it and last long.</li>
            <li>fast delivery, I like the way my hair look after coloring, covers all grey hair, no smel or irritation after</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>There is NOTHING that is 100% natural that can or will completely dye a human hair fiber.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The product is used exactly the same as conventional hair color.  </li>
            <li>She likes because it&#x27;s natural for sensitive customer with chemical other products.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>My hair is a lot healthier since using Naturtint, less breakage and really shiny.  </li>

            <li> Have tried many lines, including professional color before.</li>
            <li> we can check all the ingredient and be surprised that even it this  is the most healthy and natural hair dye on the market it still includes 3 very harmful ingredient .:-</li>
            <li> I already had been buying this brand from a local store (Whole Foods) and liked the idea of a more natural hair color.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle, but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> A friend had recommended this product and it had worked really well for me!</li>
            <li> No chemical and not irritating to the skin at all!</li>
            <li> is way cheaper than buying it at Whole Foods!</li>
            <li> Unfortunatly I tought like a  lots of us here thinking about this product that is chemichal free and 100 % natural</li>
            <li> I got 6 pack before and the quality and amount of products in each box was exactly how it should be.</li>
            <li> I love the colour for a Asian girl.</li>
            <li> The product is great and the cost is less if you buy it direct.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve started using it, I have been getting complimented on how nice my hair looks, and it actually works better than any other brand I have used.</li>
            <li> The color was soft and rich, and did not fade.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s hard to see how they can improve on this near perfect product--maybe use 100% natural ingredients?  </li>
            <li> Simply put, this product does not permanently dye gray hairs and can/will wash out somewhat easily.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Naturtint since I was pregnant with my 4 year old.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hair color for years and buying them one box at a time from Whole Foods for about $18 each.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, as described</li>
            <li> Very affordable buying it  </li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li> and it really lowers the price per unit.</li>
            <li> Then I came across this product at Whole Food.  </li>
            <li> Shipping fast and priced very competitively</li>
            <li> The color stays for much longer.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn her scalp, and leaves her hair feeling and looking the way she wants it</li>
            <li> and this works very well.  </li>
            <li> have mixed several colors of Naturtint over the years, creating my own shades.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, and the color lasts long.</li>
            <li> I love the product because it doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate my scalp like other hair colors.</li>
            <li> The color stays true as well and doesn&#x27;t start to fade or turn red after a while.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This natural dye really does do the trick.</li>
            <li> The color came out very close to my natural born color.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why the store marked it up so much.</li>
            <li> exactly what she wants cheaper than at the local drug store.</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering the 6 pack, and I plan to continue since it is economical.</li>
            <li> Each application lasts about 8 shampoos for me and adequately covers my grey.</li>
            <li> - you get a nice, even glossy color that lasts pretty well or at least comparable to commercial colors.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very natural looking,</li>
            <li> No more drugstore dyes, although would like more color choices.</li>
            <li> Have tried other local brand names before for many years.  </li>
            <li> However, my hair was in good condition before I colored it; since then, it&#x27;s been extremely dry, with lots of flyaways and frizz, tangles both dry and wet, no matter what I do.  </li>
            <li> not completely chemical free but a lot less toxic than most other hair dyes.</li>
            <li> is my favorite dye because it left my hair looking like a natural black.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Firstly, my review does not touch on whether or not the product is truly natural.  </li>
            <li> As the old adage goes, something&#x27;s gotta give.</li>
            <li> They shouldn&#x27;t have marked it up to that degree, and I would have continued purchasing it there.</li>
            <li> I use one every six weeks because it all natural.</li>
            <li> All natural, covers the gray.</li>
            <li> My husband said it look like my natural hair color.</li>
            <li> There are no harsh smells or chemicals.</li>
            <li> Gives you a natural look.</li>
            <li> The right color fits me and it and last long.</li>
            <li> fast delivery, I like the way my hair look after coloring, covers all grey hair, no smel or irritation after</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> There is NOTHING that is 100% natural that can or will completely dye a human hair fiber.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The product is used exactly the same as conventional hair color.  </li>
            <li> She likes because it&#x27;s natural for sensitive customer with chemical other products.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> My hair is a lot healthier since using Naturtint, less breakage and really shiny.  </li>
            <li> far as how well it works, I have been coloring my hair with conventional, permanent hair color for about twenty years</li>
            <li> Long lasting color for 5-6 weeks.  </li>
            <li> ( I waited as long as I could, but had to color it before a wedding in my 3rd trimester!).  </li>
            <li> I am a 46 female with long hair.</li>
            <li> Also It keeps the color long.</li>
            <li> Covers grey well</li>
            <li> Only half the price of local store.</li>
            <li> I will be a long term customer !</li>
            <li> For a soft black I use the dark chesnut brown 3N</li>
            <li> My wife complained about having burning itching scalp, when she was using normal hair dyes.  </li>
            <li> The grays that do pick up the active ingredients in the dye will tend to do so partially, which creates hues in various shades of lighter brown.  </li>
            <li> but I got half of amount of products in every single package:</li>
            <li> Dark brown from other brands leave my hair looking close to jet black and looking unnatural.</li>
            <li> Hate having to cover my greys, but I&#x27;ll be using this until I find a better product.  </li>
            <li> It colors just as well as any of the other hair coloring products, without the harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> Try as you might, but apply the product as instructed, and you&#x27;ll be seeing those grays again in less than a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got them from a amazon store one time with a much cheaper price and found something weird in the both little bottles----the uneven colors and the uneven liquid material.</li>
            <li> it colors a little darker than color on box -</li>
            <li> I have been using Naturtint Permanent Hair color for quite a few years.</li>
            <li> Every other hair dye I&#x27;ve used has caused my scalp to itch for at least a week after application.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I&#x27;ll try the &#x27;name brands&#x27; or the stylist next time.</li>
            <li> Usually get a couple at a time but</li>
            <li> No more itching burning scalp.</li>
            <li> Always had issue with color fading away, itchy burning scalp, dull hair.</li>
            <li> I had been buying it at the health food store, and I hate to switch from a local purchase like that to purchasing online, but I couldn&#x27;t afford it.</li>
            <li> I hate Grey hair</li>
            <li> I bought this from vitamin shop and it was too expensive.</li>
            <li> I had to use to boxes :(  </li>
            <li> Stupid me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in it just for that reason.  </li>
            <li> this hair color (because it has no ammonia) does not have that horrible smell you always get with hair color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> always good for this products it keep my hair looking good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hair color for years and buying them one box at a time from Whole Foods for about $18 each. Stupid me-I never thought to check Amazon. Now I can save a ton of money and always have a box on hand instead of running out and having to go to the store.  I love the product because it doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate my scalp like other hair colors. It&#x27;s very gentle, but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> The right color fits me and it and last long. Love it!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, as described</li>
            <li> She likes because it&#x27;s natural for sensitive customer with chemical other products.&lt;br /&gt;And she is enjoying, always and love it.  Also It keeps the color long.</li>
            <li> Just went to more natural hair dye. Naturtint fits the bill.</li>
            <li> Great Price Great Product Great Service !!! What more could i say thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give this product 2.75 stars if I could...and here is my summary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, my review does not touch on whether or not the product is truly natural.  There is NOTHING that is 100% natural that can or will completely dye a human hair fiber.  Simply put, this product does not permanently dye gray hairs and can/will wash out somewhat easily.  The grays that do pick up the active ingredients in the dye will tend to do so partially, which creates hues in various shades of lighter brown.  Try as you might, but apply the product as instructed, and you&#x27;ll be seeing those grays again in less than a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess one cannot have &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and have a dyeing agent that truly works.  As the old adage goes, something&#x27;s gotta give.</li>
            <li> Very affordable buying it  y the 6 pack and I am able to divide each application into two. Each application lasts about 8 shampoos for me and adequately covers my grey.</li>
            <li> No more drugstore dyes, although would like more color choices.</li>
            <li> I buy a 6-pack once per year for my mom ... exactly what she wants cheaper than at the local drug store.</li>
            <li> I was amazed how quickly these guys shipped it! Even the peoduct is good. Non toxic and safe. But i took away 1 star as my greys are back within 2 weeks 😒</li>
            <li> fast delivery, I like the way my hair look after coloring, covers all grey hair, no smel or irritation after</li>
            <li> Have been using this brand and color 3N to match my original hair color and to cover gray roots. Love it that has no allergic reaction and seems gentle on my scalp.</li>
            <li> Very good grey coverage.  The color was soft and rich, and did not fade. I highly recommend this product and Amazon has it for a great price.</li>
            <li> I have been using Naturtint for several years now. It&#x27;s the only hair color that doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp.</li>
            <li> In ingredients list has cancer causing ingredients like aminophenol , para-phenylenediamine - http://www.nyrnaturalnews.com/article/the-hair-dyecancer-connection/</li>
            <li> I loved the color! Fantastic product!  My hair looked healthy, shiny, without odors.  Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x60;m 32 years and full gray.&lt;br /&gt;And this color is very good&lt;br /&gt;cover very well.&lt;br /&gt;for 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;leave hair soft..clean and shiny&lt;br /&gt;I got 6 boxes since is really good. not allergy</li>
            <li> I have used this brand for years and love the natural colour it gives me. I bought a six pack and it really lowers the price per unit.</li>
            <li> I love the product. Great price.</li>
            <li> The color turned out great. However, my hair was in good condition before I colored it; since then, it&#x27;s been extremely dry, with lots of flyaways and frizz, tangles both dry and wet, no matter what I do.  I have tried conditioning treatments and it hasn&#x27;t helped. I&#x27;m very disappointed in it just for that reason.  My hair has never been dry, and I&#x27;ve colored it off and on for many, many years.  This has never happened before.  Sadly, I&#x27;ll try the &#x27;name brands&#x27; or the stylist next time.</li>
            <li> Great color, non-toxic, covers color-resistant gray hair.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a semi-permenant hair color product at first because I wanted something that is ammonia free.  Then I came across this product at Whole Food.  I tried it and liked it.  My hair seems healthier after using it.  It saves me time and money not having to go to a salon.</li>
            <li> Great price for 6 boxes!!</li>
            <li> Love it Love it Love it!!!!!  Long lasting color for 5-6 weeks.  No ammonia, no smell, easy application, no staining on skin and has botanicals which  is a plus!!!  Color looks natural and I have had many compliments on the color and the shine!!!</li>
            <li> I love this hair dye. It doesnt stink and make you cry like all the others. not completely chemical free but a lot less toxic than most other hair dyes. I wont use anything else.</li>
            <li> The best I&#x27;ve used so far.  No yucky smell, stays on hair nicely for the 20-30 minutes without dripping, and the final step moisturizer/stabilizer softens hair nicely.  Love the 6-pack pricing.  Hate having to cover my greys, but I&#x27;ll be using this until I find a better product.  Although it&#x27;s hard to see how they can improve on this near perfect product--maybe use 100% natural ingredients?  As I think there is still some chemicals used here.</li>
            <li> Excellent product that I&#x27;ve been using for years. The price here cannot be beat!</li>
            <li> I originally found this hair dye at Whole Foods because I was looking for an ammonia-free hair dye to use while I was pregnant. I loved it and how it covered all my grays and decided to find it on Amazon for a cheaper price. I love how it covers all my roots and doesn&#x27;t have any harmful chemicals which can effect my growing baby. I will probably continue to use this product even after I give birth just because I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t damage my hair and is ammonia-free. I definitely recommend this to anyone worried who might be worried about the harmful chemicals found in regular hair dye.</li>
            <li> Been using for years and love it!!</li>
            <li> Great color dye! A friend had recommended this product and it had worked really well for me!</li>
            <li> The color and the coverage are good.  This natural dye really does do the trick. I am happy.  So far, so good.</li>
            <li> Shipping fast and priced very competitively</li>
            <li> My hair is a lot healthier since using Naturtint, less breakage and really shiny.  It colors just as well as any of the other hair coloring products, without the harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I expected. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> The color came out very close to my natural born color. It always makes my hair silky and healthy looking. Great product and best price at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Maturity is natural and good to use.  I&#x27;ve used it for years.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 2 years and normally only buy them in stores. I got them from a amazon store one time with a much cheaper price and found something weird in the both little bottles----the uneven colors and the uneven liquid material. I was scared to use them. I wondered if they were outdate or something, but I didn&#x27;t find any expiration information on the package.</li>
            <li> Great product keeps color and for graying hair</li>
            <li> LOVE IT MAKES MY HAIR SO FULL AND SHINY! THANK YOU WISH IT WERE CHEAPER .</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  No chemical and not irritating to the skin at all!</li>
            <li> Affordable, fast, &amp; accurate order. The wife has used the product before and is happy with it. So, this is a replacement product order.</li>
            <li> Usually get a couple at a time but this was a better offer.</li>
            <li> My wife complained about having burning itching scalp, when she was using normal hair dyes.  Tried various brands same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Found this hair dye.....it solved the problem.  No more itching burning scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Naturtint since I was pregnant with my 4 year old.  ( I waited as long as I could, but had to color it before a wedding in my 3rd trimester!).  I have no complaints about this product and buying on Amazon is way cheaper than buying it at Whole Foods!</li>
            <li> Every other hair dye I&#x27;ve used has caused my scalp to itch for at least a week after application. This one does not which is why it&#x27;s the only brand I use.</li>
            <li> Good product, reasonable price. Very satisfied both me and my wife.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use and provides excellent results, while limiting exposure to harsh chemicals. This is my second time ordering the 6 pack, and I plan to continue since it is economical.</li>
            <li> I have been using Naturtint Permanent Hair color for quite a few years. I love it and will not use anything else. My hair is healthy, shiny, and the colors are exceptional. There are not the chemicals in this product as the ones you find in drugstores and at your hair salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have mixed several colors of Naturtint over the years, creating my own shades.  I often get compliments on my hair and how healthy it looks and I am in my 60&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;As my hair has started to gray, it covers the gray without a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color lasts me for about 4 weeks, before loosing its richness. I am outdoors in the sun a lot and also in a chlorinated pool several times a week. So for someone who does not do these things it likely will last even longer.</li>
            <li> I have been using this hair product for about a year, and I really think it is excellent. It does not damage my hair at all. Since I&#x27;ve started using it, I have been getting complimented on how nice my hair looks, and it actually works better than any other brand I have used. The color stays for much longer. Also, the price is great. I had been buying it at the health food store, and I hate to switch from a local purchase like that to purchasing online, but I couldn&#x27;t afford it. At the store it was $17 a box, and online it&#x27;s $44 for 6 boxes. I don&#x27;t understand why the store marked it up so much. They shouldn&#x27;t have marked it up to that degree, and I would have continued purchasing it there.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product.  It does a great job and I will continue to purchase.  Great quality and price!</li>
            <li> very good product, and very good price.</li>
            <li> Unfortunatly I tought like a  lots of us here thinking about this product that is chemichal free and 100 % natural ,its isnt .On website EWG skin deep we can check all the ingredient and be surprised that even it this  is the most healthy and natural hair dye on the market it still includes 3 very harmful ingredient .:-(</li>
            <li> Good for folks who have sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Excellent hair colour ! Wonderful coverage , pleasant smell , gentle on hair &amp; scalp . I am so happy I ordered this product , it is the best colour I have ever used. My hair looks &amp; feels amazing , vibrant &amp; healthier . I so appreciate the bulk ordering &amp; the prompt arrival &amp; packaging ... I will be a long term customer ! Thank You :)</li>
            <li> My wife loves it. It doesn&#x27;t burn her scalp, and leaves her hair feeling and looking the way she wants it</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, doesn&#x27;t burn scalp, covers gray hairs 100%, hair look natural and silky after using this product. Have tried many lines, including professional color before. Always had issue with color fading away, itchy burning scalp, dull hair. Naturtint is the best organic permanent hair color and has NO HARMFUL CHEMICALS.</li>
            <li> The product is great and the cost is less if you buy it direct. I use one every six weeks because it all natural. I received it in 6 days.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the best all natural hair colors out there. I&#x27;ve used it for about 4 years now and I color regularly. Only to save money will I occasionally buy a commercial color but eagerly come back to Nutratint on my next color. It does a beautiful job of coloring your hair - you get a nice, even glossy color that lasts pretty well or at least comparable to commercial colors. Best of all, it has a very mild scent which is a plus considering the overpowering fumes of commercial colors. No stinging scalp either! Great product!!! Excellent value too, especially purchased in multi-pack - clearly this is your best value considering retail prices. Only tip- it colors a little darker than color on box - For a soft black I use the dark chesnut brown 3N</li>
            <li> This brand of hair color is really good. Easy to use, and the color lasts long. The seller (Naturtint) is good as they ship the product in a fast speed and package so well. I like this product and the seller.</li>
            <li> I love this brand and color but I got half of amount of products in every single package:(  When I&#x27;m buying at the store, one package its just perfect to color my hair in this case I had to use to boxes :(  I got 6 pack before and the quality and amount of products in each box was exactly how it should be. This time is a quite of deaspointment.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered quickly. All natural, covers the gray.</li>
            <li> I bought this from vitamin shop and it was too expensive. I will now buy from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;This is my favorite dye because it left my hair looking like a natural black. Dark brown from other brands leave my hair looking close to jet black and looking unnatural. My husband said it look like my natural hair color. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Excellent color and quality.  Have tried other local brand names before for many years.  And this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an expert about which ingredients are toxic and which ones aren&#x27;t, but I do know what I smell and this hair color (because it has no ammonia) does not have that horrible smell you always get with hair color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as how well it works, I have been coloring my hair with conventional, permanent hair color for about twenty years and I can honestly say that this color works just as well.  The color stays true as well and doesn&#x27;t start to fade or turn red after a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is used exactly the same as conventional hair color.  It comes with gloves, a mixing bottle with developer in it and a separate tube with color.  You mix them, apply, and leave it on the same amount of time - for me, about 45 minutes.  There is a single-use conditioner too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They sell this color at local stores but you can&#x27;t beat the price at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy coloring!</li>
            <li> Everything was great!</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Great price, fast service!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than 5 years and I love the way it covers my stubborn grays! The only reason I need a touchup every 4 weeks is because my hair grows out, not because the color fades. This color lasts! I love the shade. It&#x27;s very natural looking,</li>
            <li> My family only uses this for all their hair dye needs. There are no harsh smells or chemicals. It lasts for 2- 3 months.</li>
            <li> I already had been buying this brand from a local store (Whole Foods) and liked the idea of a more natural hair color.  I hate Grey hair and this works very well.  The reason for buying them on Amazon was the much better price.</li>
            <li> Covers grey well and there&#x27;s no toxic fumes or burning to the scalp.  My hair looks healthy and shiny after use.</li>
            <li> I love the colour for a Asian girl. Only half the price of local store.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 5 years! I am a 46 female with long hair. It doesn&#x27;t damage your hair and keeps it healthy and full of luster. Gives you a natural look.</li>
