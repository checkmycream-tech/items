            <li>this is the ONE and GREAT price.</li>
            <li>Great battery life (even with extended use)  </li>
            <li>So-so:  Trimmer (great feature, but semi-shabby construction</li>
            <li>but, it works great for me.  </li>
            <li>The push-up trimmer is also a great feature.  </li>
            <li>It doesnt work great with longer hair</li>
            <li>Great razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;OK, this is still a great razor.</li>
            <li>The razor works great in the shower too if you prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Panasonic was a great company when they manufactured in Japan</li>
            <li>This product is a great value:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Why spend 2-3xs more if you don&#x27;t have to!!</li>
            <li>Very nice shaver.</li>
            <li>This shaver does a nice job, but it takes me 10 minutes!  </li>
            <li>I have owned mostly Braun as I thought they were the best</li>
            <li>ES-SA40-K works great, holds a good charge.</li>
            <li>Out of the box, it had a strong charge and shaved great!    </li>
            <li>Excellent Shaver great for a quick shave.</li>
            <li>I chose the ES-SA40-K because it had a fine price and excellent reviews.    </li>
            <li>I love it and get very good shaves.</li>
            <li>It does fairly well without preshave or shaving cream.</li>
            <li>and every shave, thereafter, has been just as good.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product on the basis of good reviews here and that I had never tried a Wet/Dry shaver before.  </li>
            <li>Sounds wise huh?  </li>
            <li>Well it is wise.</li>
            <li>Good in the shower also.</li>
            <li>The day came, and I received my shaver, nice style, great grip...</li>
            <li>I got this razor after reading the good reviews.</li>
            <li>just never cut, so I thought I&#x27;d try the Panasonic ES-SA40-K which got fairly good reviews.</li>
            <li>Good product for the price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with good ol&#x27; shaving cream and a Bic.</li>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s a good electric razor.</li>
            <li>Feel like it is a good  product for the price.   </li>
            <li>Nothing fancy, just reliable shaving with good results.</li>
            <li>I get a close shave, ergonomics are good and with an 8 hour charge it will run about a week.</li>
            <li>but the Remington was just as good</li>
            <li>The battery is not quite as good as the others but the shave is and that&#x27;s all that counts along with the price.</li>
            <li>It is a good value.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a top-of-the-line model and it didn&#x27;t do nearly as good a job on my neck as this</li>
            <li>Good shaver for a good price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying this because I&#x27;ve always had good luck with Panasonic products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Admittedly, the shave is not as close as what I got with the Brauns, but for me this is a fantastic compliment to blade shaving, and the perfect travel and mid-day business razor.  </li>
            <li>I figured it had to be good if it cost $300 bucks</li>
            <li>The Braun did good</li>
            <li>I had a 4 head microscreen that did not do as good a job.</li>
            <li>The prise is good; however, the product is even better!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price, and the performance is excellent.   </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very satisfied with this shaver and plan to buy a spare in case</li>
            <li>It works great even in the shower, I love that I can use it without worrying that water will damage it.</li>
            <li>when i saw the package it looked very stylish and durable.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t tested the battery life yet, but am very pleased with the shaver.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this shaver for about a month now and am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased that I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the performance and price of the Panasonic.</li>
            <li>Very Very pleased.</li>
            <li>None of them give you the best shave around the neck, but the Panasonic ES-SA40-K Pro Curve Wet/Dry Shaver, single blade has done the best of all of them.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s resting right on those blades.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, perfect for me.</li>
            <li>the shape is nice, the recharger is nice, battery life is good after a year&#x27;s use.  </li>
            <li>I love this electric, wet-dry razor!</li>
            <li>The sideburn trimmer appears to work somewhat more effectively, however, this is going to be returned!</li>
            <li>Still, that&#x27;s pretty impressive in my book.</li>
            <li>more than this machine ($25.99)!   </li>
            <li>Very good rechargeable shaver used for weekend shaves when a super close blade shave not needed.</li>
            <li>Trimmer excellent and quality very high.</li>
            <li>All in all amazing for the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the fanciest razor, but for the money it&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li>plugged up in the bathroom for handy use.</li>
            <li>I bought one for my brother and now he&#x27;s loving it too.  </li>
            <li>Save a couple more bucks and go for a good shaver.</li>
            <li>honestly, i bought this shaver because of the price.  </li>
            <li>3-4 (+) times for it to actually be effective.  </li>
            <li>the wet/dry option is really nice too.</li>
            <li>It feels nice, has a nice charger that holds it up on the wall.</li>
            <li>I just got this and it cuts nice and close.</li>
            <li>This is a nice model for a teenager to use at the dorms.  </li>
            <li>This electric shaver is nice for the price.</li>
            <li>I saw so many good reviews I decided to take a chance on this shaver.</li>
            <li>For the price it has many good features.</li>
            <li>if u want clean cut use razor, this trimmer is great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the best on the neck, have to spend a decent amount of time to get all the hairs.</li>
            <li>The battery seems very strong and I recharge after every 3 or 4 uses.</li>
            <li>Very nice razor for a quick shave.  </li>
            <li>It provided a solution to a specialized problem and it has proven to be safe and effective.  </li>
            <li>Best shave so far.</li>
            <li>Maybe when he goes out into the professional world he will want and need a higher-end model, but this is perfect for now.</li>
            <li>Works great right out the box.  </li>
            <li>It is light and easily taken with me on trips, or used to \\&quot;tidy up\\&quot; if I want to go out without looking like Richard Nixon!</li>
            <li>Very cheap</li>
            <li>Its great, fast, holds a charge nicely, and rinses easily.</li>
            <li>Does not shave as good as a bigger model but is nice for travel, compact and easy to pack and that is great.</li>
            <li>I shave in the shower and have used many of the Panasonic wet/dry shavers.  </li>
            <li>Some better than others.  </li>
            <li>For some puzzling reason, this electric shaver works better around my mustache and chin than a blade.  </li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s water proof.</li>
            <li>All around an awesome razor especially for the price.</li>
            <li>no matter how many times I went over them.  </li>
            <li>It works as well or better than any electrical shaver I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m all too pleased.</li>
            <li>allow me to shave safely in the shower     2.</li>
            <li>it has sufficient weight and   balance to use it confidently with plenty of control and feedback.  </li>
            <li>Even more, it gave me the smoothest shave ever</li>
            <li>I have been using Panasonic razors for many years and was always pleased with them.</li>
            <li>More that a year with one.</li>
            <li>and i love it..</li>
            <li>And my husband shaves more often.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t need a 2 or more blades to shave.  </li>
            <li>Most electric shavers can&#x27;t reach the hairs under my jawbone, but this one can.</li>
            <li>Most days, I don&#x27;t bother with shaving cream.</li>
            <li>is the perfect combination of performance and low cost.  </li>
            <li>It has been a worthwhile purchase.  </li>
            <li>like it even better than my $80</li>
            <li>because they offer better shaves from a selection of lower priced units according to review sites.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s all planned obsolescents for greater profit per quarter&#x27;.</li>
            <li>It should also be noted that the shaver does vibrate more than what I am used to and does not possess a corded</li>
            <li>This \\&quot;shaver\\&quot; works ok on the majority of my face, but under my chin it does nothing but cause pain.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I also am not the kind of guy who needs to have baby smooth face.  </li>
            <li>Well, after using it for a month, I am extremely pleased with this shaver.  </li>
            <li>No way you find a better electric shaver for under $30.</li>
            <li>I have many, many hairs that the shaver will just not get and have to be tweezed.</li>
            <li>am still glad that I have the ES-SA40.</li>
            <li>I am still glad that I have the ES-SA40.</li>
            <li>On top of that the shave is close</li>
            <li>I owned it for over a month and am satisfied with the purchase.   </li>
            <li>I love this Razor -</li>
            <li>Seems like a better idea than buying one for 5 times the cost.</li>
            <li>I have owned somewhere about 30  electric shavers and have found the one blade shavers do a better job than the 2-3-4 blade shavers (and there cheaper).</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it but cannot find ability to order another on Amazon.</li>
            <li>One more thing to research before purchasing.</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this razor for about 4 years now, and still love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The outlet mount charger is better for me, but may not work for others.  </li>
            <li>It also hurts my face more than a manual razor would.</li>
            <li>aside, you aren&#x27;t going to do much better for the price.</li>
            <li>Love the charger, love the feel of the unit, love it all.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe they don&#x27;t charge more for these.</li>
            <li>I have had this more than a year and still shaving like it&#x27;s supposed to.  </li>
            <li>20 years ago this was my favorite razor, then it seemed to disappear from the market.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Holds a charge for many many shaves&lt;br /&gt;compact&lt;br /&gt;easy</li>
            <li>I urge anyone that wants a great shave, this is  one you should buy.</li>
            <li>If you are in a hurry and need an ok shaver...</li>
            <li>Battery life is ok.</li>
            <li>This looked like a great idea - and some things really work:  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this razor.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this shaver.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a low cost shaver, this one it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>This Panasonic doesn&#x27;t shave quite as close, but it is quieter, more ergonomic, has a better blade cover, and has a unique, effective charger.</li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>when fully charged it works GREAT - holds a charge for a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li>Clean up a breeze, and that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>well, light, very easy to use and charge.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a high powered computer that includes everything and comes at a great deal, except</li>
            <li>It works great with lather and almost as good dry.</li>
            <li>It operates in both wet/dry conditions, and always produces a very clean and close shave, and for me ALWAYS without any razor burn.  </li>
            <li>Nevertheless this $30 shaver gives me a very clean shave.</li>
            <li>It has a pretty good battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a pretty good battery life.    </li>
            <li>a good first shaver.</li>
            <li>Bought the es-sa40-k since it&#x27;s almost exactly like the older Panasonic model which worked perfectly for six years.</li>
            <li>Being able to use it in the shower is nice but in reality I rarely use it it the shower.</li>
            <li>Being able to use it in the shower is nice but in reality I rarely use it it the shower.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t impress easily, but I&#x27;m enjoying using this shaver.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always bought the \\&quot;basic\\&quot; Panasonic shaver as it always gave a good shave, was very inexpensive and like most shavers disposable as the battery cannot be replaced.  </li>
            <li>Seems to work better and is definitely more comfortable in the shower.</li>
            <li>Has a nice wall charger and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic ES-SA40-K Pro Curve Wet/Dry Shaver single blade gives me the best shave for the cost.  </li>
            <li>for single blade this is probably the best shaver i have ever had</li>
            <li>This is most certainly not the greatest razor, as it does have difficulties with longer hairs.</li>
            <li>I liked the product was what I expected and very good quality to recommend them all very good product when I can come back to buy</li>
            <li>Light in the hand and gives as good a shave as many higher priced products.  </li>
            <li>This unit shaves pretty good the drawback I found is trimmer for side burns don&#x27;t cut so easily but don&#x27;t pull hairs either</li>
            <li>I am thrilled that I can use shaving cream to soften my beard and the cleanup under the faucet is quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>While it isn&#x27;t as close or clean as a regular razor, it is perfect for my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>This cheap electric shaver turns on and make lovely sounds</li>
            <li>The closest, most comfortable shave in the shower.</li>
            <li>This shaver is great as it gives a close shave but is not harsh on your face.  </li>
            <li>If you buy one, I&#x27;m sure you will enjoy it, and you may find yourself wishing everything was made this well.</li>
            <li>It does a good job in a reasonable amount of time.  </li>
            <li>This one is also easy to clean and the foil has a nice fit to the shaver itself.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean!</li>
            <li>First the good, the item shipped quickly, was well packaged, and appears stylish.  </li>
            <li>This is a very useful shaver for most men.  </li>
            <li>This means that I can shave my head more quickly and confidently.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a shaver that had a single head, no swivel, and this fit the bill perfectly.  </li>
            <li>How cool is that?!</li>
            <li>There may be equal or even better shavers for a much higher price, but this is my best experience.  </li>
            <li>and then they are easy to shave.    </li>
            <li>The pop-up trim is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>transformer/charger keeps razor off of counter.&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable and easy to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good performance on a budget  Works well on the scalp  Great for everyday use.    </li>
            <li>The pop-up trimmer is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>easy to use and charge.</li>
            <li>It is compact and easy to maneuver around my hairline (I have a gotee).</li>
            <li>Easy cleaning    </li>
            <li>I have paid as much as $150.00 for electric shavers in my battle against razor bumps, but this by far the best shaver that I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>I have not charged mine up in 2 weeks and it is still running strong.</li>
            <li>Decided to purchase this particular one because it good reviews and was easy on the wallet.  </li>
            <li>Strong motor, lots of zooms.  </li>
            <li>I like the fact it is easy to clean and the straight cutter is good for sideburns.  </li>
            <li>The quality of materials is very high, the fit and finish is exceptional.    </li>
            <li>Braun razors hands down were the best razors that you could get until gillette /proctor-gamble acquired the company in 2005.</li>
            <li>I would say it hasn&#x27;t sped up my shaving process, but its nice to be able on a whim to get a quick trim, without having to use lather and hot water.</li>
            <li>this Panasonic ES-SA40-K Pro is your best choice for less money.</li>
            <li>Comfortable and easy to hold.   </li>
            <li>and it is still working fine.  </li>
            <li>It works fine, no oxidation.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and fits my hand fine.  </li>
            <li>Always thought one head would be less of a perfect shave.  </li>
            <li>trimmer does it&#x27;s job, but I don&#x27;t have a beard or mustache, so maybe that&#x27;s why it works fine for</li>
            <li>However, it quickly became my favorite razor.</li>
            <li>my skin is super sensitive and this feels great.</li>
            <li>If you are searching for a good shaver, that is strong and last for some time for sure</li>
            <li>This is good for a quick shave/touchup, but it isn&#x27;t great for everyday shaving.</li>
            <li>mostly use a razor to shave but find this very useful to deal with 5 O&#x27;clock shadow or a quick weekend shave.</li>
            <li>The trimmer was a huge problem for this shaver.  </li>
            <li>I have a mustache, and this shaves and trims accurately and closely.</li>
            <li>thank you Amazon for such great quality products.</li>
            <li>The smooth slim design allows for ease of use on curved areas, underarms, knees etc.</li>
            <li>Really enjoy how it feels and works.</li>
            <li>I actually use this to shave my head--works great.  </li>
            <li>I use it in the shower which makes it easy to rinse clean.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li>I read the instructions and all and tried and tried but it wouldnt do anything besides a sound.   </li>
            <li>It did clean up easily under running water.</li>
            <li>This razor is easy to clean and maintain.  </li>
            <li>The last one is still in great working condition, but has been put away as a backup for me.</li>
            <li>For the low price I was kind of worried it would not work very well, but it works great.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I had no intention of using this - it&#x27;s headed to my son in Afghanistan.  </li>
            <li>close and comfortable shave everytime.</li>
            <li>I bought this one because the replacement parts are relatively cheap.  </li>
            <li>Feels cheap and the sideburns trimer feels really cheap</li>
            <li>I have what I consider a moderate beard and the shaver works great on all areas of the face and neck.</li>
            <li>My \\&quot;beard\\&quot; is light, which helps, but I have never even had to change the blades.</li>
            <li>This Panasonic is a good-looking wet/dry shaver with an outer foil which easily pops off so that it can be rinsed clean with water.</li>
            <li>I had another cheap razor before this one that I lost, which I am going to purchase again after this experience.</li>
            <li>It is light weight, yet it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap, but rather well built.</li>
            <li>and it is  easy to clean.</li>
            <li>This is a great shaver for the cost!It is quiet and gives a close shave.</li>
            <li>Wish it was available again</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shave as closely as husband&#x27;s Gillette Mach3 Turbo razor, but he&#x27;s happy with the overall quality of this shaver.</li>
            <li>This shaver is easy to clean, and I have tested it in the water.</li>
            <li>I would not use this as your primary shaver.</li>
            <li>Now, I primarily shave with a blade in the shower, and then follow up with this in front of the mirror.  </li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s important to you (??).</li>
            <li>Using a duplex to 6 outlet adapter, the charger takes up 2 of the 6 outlets, leaving 4 free.  </li>
            <li>Some reviews claimed that it was great while others seemed to think that it was only so-so.</li>
            <li>and it never give smooth</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>I have been a Norelco user for many years but never seem to get a really close shave even after many passes.</li>
            <li>overall i&#x27;m satisfied with this panasonic and for the price, it&#x27;s a good value.</li>
            <li>This shaver really does a great job shaving very close to the skin</li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to clean and provides a nice smooth shave for someone who cannot, or does not want to, deal with a high maintenance cordless shaver.</li>
            <li>allowed triming of longer (half-inch) beard growth in areas that had escaped my regular razor for a month (this was accoplished with the very effective sideburn and beard trimming cutter built into the razor).    </li>
            <li>Pros:  Quick, easy, and relatively smooth</li>
            <li>At first I was like, OK does about as good as my old Remmy but gave it a week anyway to see if things might improve.</li>
            <li>I am saving money by not longer shaving in a hot shower. :-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure they don&#x27;t have medicine cabinets in tents.</li>
            <li>This shaver performs ok, about the same as most, but there are probably ones that shave closer (for more money).  </li>
            <li>The higher end Panasonic shavers may work better.  </li>
            <li>Replaced another Panasonic shaver that lasted 14 years with this unit and love this one just as much!</li>
            <li>Battery lasts forever, and after 4 years I&#x27;m still on my original head and foil.  </li>
            <li>i really love this thing, it cuts the hair good and it doesnt feel like its pulling the hair out like alot of other cheap</li>
            <li>I had an older Panasonic shaver that I had for 7 years and when I needed a new one, I was happy to find the newer improved version of what I had.</li>
            <li>It gives me a clean shave without a lot of effort.  </li>
            <li>i do like the fact that i can run it under water to rinse it clean.  </li>
            <li>If I might be gross, it is far and away the best inside the ear and inside the nose shaver I have ever used.</li>
            <li>i use it to clean up the rest of my face after a line up</li>
            <li>B000050FDQ Braun 7526 Syncro Shaver System with Clean &amp; Charge Storage Stand]]</li>
            <li>I use it &#x27;dry&#x27;, but have, on occasion, used it in the shower with great results.  </li>
            <li>it is beautifully built by panasonic and it has never failed to give peak performance even though i have been  using it for several years.</li>
            <li>Razor works great for a single foil cutter.</li>
            <li>It shaves really close and it glides very smooth across my face.</li>
            <li>it shaves OK, but not as good as other electric dual-head shavers.  </li>
            <li>AC adapter/charger (a bit large, but doubles as a make-shift counter top stand for your shaver when not in use)  </li>
            <li>I was pleased with the very first shave - comfortable, and very close . . .</li>
            <li>After the second shave I wanted to say that is actually a very good shaver for the price you get, actually its better than the price.</li>
            <li>firstly, all the great reviews and then of course the low price.</li>
            <li>My husband has never liked electric shavers, so an inexpensive one was the best way to test if he&#x27;d use it.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, the charger is fairly nice - no messy chord.  </li>
            <li>Lasts about 3 full shaves in between charges, and still runs after that, but I can feel it getting sluggish.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly good performance from such an inexpensive product.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re looking for the full package.</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my teenage nephew, he loved it.  </li>
            <li>Good value was a lot cheaper than others and does the same job</li>
            <li>This is better than razors that cost twice as much.</li>
            <li>Used to be a Remington man, but they discontinued their very good low end model in lieu of a new crappy one.</li>
            <li>The Braun foils seemed to be wearing out much more quickly than they used to also, and the price for a replacement foil and cutter was almost as much as the Panasonic costs.</li>
            <li>The shaver leaves some felt stubble right after I&#x27;m done shaving but which turns smooth to the touch after applying after shave.</li>
            <li>It is quieter and provides better shave quality than the older one (ES8077 wet/dry linear model) at a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li>This unit is a tremendous value for the purchase price.</li>
            <li>shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Smooth and non-irritating on the skin, easy to clean, very fast.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>It outperforms my older Panasonic rechargeable with almost a week more use.  </li>
            <li>This razor is decent, however don&#x27;t expect a top shaving experience from it.</li>
            <li>Without reservation I highly recommend both of these shavers, and will buy two more as backups.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had very good luck with Panasonic products in the past.</li>
            <li>It is good for a quick shave as long as you are not wanted a \\&quot;CLEAN\\&quot; shave.</li>
            <li>then some...very very very close shave and very powerful had it for almost a year n</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned this razor for about 5 weeks now and am very satisfied with the performance, especially for the price I paid.</li>
            <li>Easy operation (large on/off switch, ergonomic grip)  </li>
            <li>My father had an older Panasonic and liked it so much (still working) that he asked me to send him one of these.</li>
            <li>The sale price wasn&#x27;t much more than a new cutter/screen set, so I just bought another shaver for myself and one for a son.  </li>
            <li>Had one of these many years ago, and when I needed a new one....</li>
            <li>I took it easy and didn&#x27;t get much irritation.</li>
            <li>It shaves much faster than an older two foil shaver, is much more comfortable, shaves just as close and is not as noisy.</li>
            <li>As a dry shaver, I miss a lot of those curly rascals and eventually have to use a razor if I want a really good shave.</li>
            <li>As usual, ordering and shipment from Amazon was fast and flawless.</li>
            <li>After first use, I can´t believe it!</li>
            <li>The Panasonic ES-SA40-K Pro Curve Wet/Dry Shaver, is the best simple single blade shaver that I have used.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended, particularly in my specialized kind of application.</li>
            <li>really durable and works fine in the shower.</li>
            <li>I like this product very much except you have to be sure to clean it frequently.</li>
            <li>And for the money, it is a great little shaver.</li>
            <li>This is a great little shaver for the money.</li>
            <li>but it is a great little guy for the price.</li>
            <li>Plus, the entire time I owned it (it worked fine for most of it&#x27;s life)</li>
            <li>Great for the day to day shaving if a razor is too harsh.  </li>
            <li>Either this is just a &#x27;me&#x27; thing, maybe some people stop shaving turn the unit over, use both hands and then pop the trimmer up, but I like to be able to do it seamlessly.</li>
            <li>I went ahead and bought one and rarely get ingrown hairs.     </li>
            <li>Ok on the face for my husband,  but my son has sensitive skin and it chews up his face too.     </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used more expensive shavers and this one is just as good as most of them.  </li>
            <li>Pictures don&#x27;t show it, but this shaver plugs directly into the top of the wall wart that plugs into the outlet.</li>
            <li>and  then it ain&#x27;t worth</li>
            <li>Worth the money I made my parents pay for it.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m pleased with the shaving performance for the price you pay.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>but if it lasts just a couple of years it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>My old shavers were Braun, Wahl, and Panasonic, all being the cheaper models and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I found these reviews and figured $40, what the heck, worth a shot.</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews...</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t work if you have more than a minimum soft beard.  </li>
            <li>My young boys love this razor</li>
            <li>Not quite as powerful but does the job,</li>
            <li>Well worth the money I paid for it.</li>
            <li>So for me it wasn&#x27;t as easy and care free as I thought it would be, but I want to make it clear that it is the first shave</li>
            <li>The motor is powerful, it shaves really closely (almost as good as a razor), it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and it is pretty quiet.</li>
            <li>Low price, good shave, and a trimmer that works decently.  </li>
            <li>the price is right for this one.</li>
            <li>You read that right.  </li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>I have always been very happy with my previous Panasonic wet/dry shavers, but this one did not indicate that the side trimmer (for sideburns) would work only on sideburns.  </li>
            <li>and I will not be able to do a quick shave regardless of the current charge status.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely thrilled with this fine little machine.  </li>
            <li>and it does great for nose hair and small amounts of side</li>
            <li>The razor was great until I put a small dent in the foil screen, now it was to cut skin or rip hair.  </li>
            <li>Nice no cord charger, and long run time.</li>
            <li>Light weight, powerful, reasonably priced, well designed charger, shaves heavy growth well, no skin irritation, very easy to clean with 409 spray cleaner and water.  </li>
            <li>Looks cheap but use great, the charger only works for wall sockets due to its orientation.</li>
            <li>I love the flat blade on the back since it&#x27;s so effective on the neck</li>
            <li>It was just about as cheap to buy a new one as it was to replace the foil and cutter block.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s more happy with the money he saves on all of those expensive Mach 3 Turbo replacement blades.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used some of the Remington&#x27;s and Norelco&#x27;s, but the extra cost didn&#x27;t produce any better shave than these economical Panasonic models.  </li>
            <li>The shaver is good for a trim but does not provide the close shave that I typically get from a manual razor.</li>
            <li>The razor (on Amazon) is only $5.00 more than these replacements and if I hit the site right shipping is included.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect this to be the equal of a new blade shave but for low cost very good results beyond my expectations.</li>
            <li>It worked great until the other day when I dropped it and it quit completely.</li>
            <li>Razor blades very quickly lose their edge with me, after 2 shaves a Power Fusion blade feels rough, while friends get 6 or more very satisfactory shaves from them</li>
            <li>The single head is more than adequate.  </li>
            <li>Great little shaver!!</li>
            <li>The rechargeable battery is NiMH, which means that it is okay to leave it fully charged most of the time - no need to drain it down like the older NiCad batteries.</li>
            <li>Now I always have a perfectly clean razor that looks like new.  </li>
            <li>You can tell in the first 20 seconds, this is a shaver of your dreams.  </li>
            <li>This is also the first time I used a non-rotary electric shaver.    </li>
            <li>This is the first wet/dry razor I have owned.  </li>
            <li>Initially the shaver worked flawlessly but 3 months later the power simply fizzes out even though I keep it charged.  </li>
            <li>so this was my first time using any shaver.</li>
            <li>However, it takes some time to get a consistent shave.</li>
            <li>However, when I used it for the first time, I felt no pulls or nicks, my skin was not irritated and...</li>
            <li>First, the feel.</li>
            <li>and I find this is able to shave next to it without pulling on the longer hairs.</li>
            <li>Actually, I charge that often more out of caution than necessity, since the razor still has charge on it when I plug it</li>
            <li>Heads and foil for most razors are simply overpriced!</li>
            <li>The batteries have never failed on any of my razors.</li>
            <li>It is the first one of this model.  </li>
            <li>Its my second and Its much better than the hand-me-down shaver</li>
            <li>This shaver shaves on the first pass so in about 15-20 seconds I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>This is my first Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li>but once you get the hang of it and brake it in, it&#x27;s much better than a regular razor for day to day use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Battery died in first two weeks.</li>
            <li>The WES9979P replacement blade and foil kit costs more than the entire travel shaver itself.  </li>
            <li>And for only $30 it doesn&#x27;t get much better.</li>
            <li>So I used this shaver for the first time</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re interested in buying this razor, I recommend it and there are still places which sell it for under $30.</li>
            <li>Have had it 3 years and it never fails.</li>
            <li>Like a hot knife thru butter.....</li>
            <li>First I like the plug adapter even though I have to make sure it does not fall out of the plug when you put the razor back in.</li>
            <li>I thought maybe I missed it on the first two passes...</li>
            <li>First let me say the pics posted on this page are not of the shaver that this page is for.   </li>
            <li>Dropped it in the trash on the first day.</li>
            <li>Also good for the environment in that you are reducing your waste by not buying disposable plastic razors or blades.</li>
            <li>There are a few good points.</li>
            <li>I hope you enjoy your new Panasonic ES-SA40-K Pro Curve Wet/Dry Shaver as much as I have.</li>
            <li>I may have to just bite the bullet and cough up the 200 bucks and just get the new Braun knowing that it will cost more and is of lower quality than my old 7526.</li>
            <li>I may have to just bite the bullet and cough up the 200 bucks and just get the new Braun knowing that it will cost more and is of lower quality than my old 7526.</li>
            <li>With this new one, I decided to shave wet--for me, much safer than using a blade and just as smooth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few others over the years, but like my Panasonic single blade the best.</li>
            <li>The low end Braun was good but seemed to frequently miss the neck hairs and soon needed a new foil.  </li>
            <li>The new model has a few cosmetic changes but the same excellent performance.</li>
            <li>Shaves good either wet or dry, light weight</li>
            <li>Excellent product, would recommend to anyone for trimming thick facial or body hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used double edge, straight razors and most electric razors over 40 years.</li>
            <li>I get this item because of high rating and the golden name of Panasonic</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s going strong on the first charge (used daily).</li>
            <li>bought this shaver after reading some positive reviews here on amazon.    </li>
            <li>I bought this as a first cordless shaver for my boyfriend, and he absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>wow what a sweet shaver this do its job</li>
            <li>and in 30+ years of shaving I&#x27;ve never found an electric that shaves as close as the old tried and true blade and water.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic has what I call a direct drive design which cuts clean and fast with no pulling.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I bought this Panasonic and it works like the old Braun.&lt;br /&gt;June</li>
            <li>It does a better job dry shaving me.</li>
            <li>I have been using this shaver for a week now (dry shaving) and I love it.</li>
            <li>I use it dry, and I love it.</li>
            <li>I previously used (and still own) the Panasonic ES3041; which judging by the design similarities, was the precursor for the ES-SA40-K.</li>
            <li>It does a good job of shaving, quality is solid and doesn&#x27;t take me long to shave.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Braun single foil shavers for many years and the one I got a year ago</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying it wont work for you, but it certainly didnt worked for me.   </li>
            <li>If it continues to perform this well, it will certainly retain the 5-star rating I gave it.</li>
            <li>This shaver does such a good job dry, I don&#x27;t know why anyone would bother fussing with it in the shower.  </li>
            <li>It works well wet or dry, has a fine trimmer, and it&#x27;s easy to clean.    </li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced for this high quality.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to go and buy a fancy double or triple head razor, this one works just fine.</li>
            <li>This shaver was relatively cheap and can be used wet or dry which is nice.</li>
            <li>The razor is light enough and well contoured enough that I can easily hold it without is falling in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I never normally expected a clean shave</li>
            <li>The Panasonic ES-SA40-K Pro shaver will provide a decently close shave for the fraction of the cost when compared to higher end electric shavers.</li>
            <li>Amazing little shaver.</li>
            <li>, this handy little razor will serve you well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is my first electric razor and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I am very hapy</li>
            <li>I just hope they don&#x27;t raise the price of this one too much.</li>
            <li>My wife really appreciates that there is no cord for recharging since it frees up the counter space my razor used to take up.</li>
            <li>Really close shave too.   </li>
            <li>One hint, is that you need shave cream or better yet hair conditioner as a skin lubricant if you shave wet.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s important to remember that everyone&#x27;s skin is different, so you know the drill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I really dig this wet/dry Panasonic shaver.  </li>
            <li>I quit using a spray lubricant as it doesn&#x27;t make much difference.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s also the cost, you get what you pay for - but the shaver seems very well designed.    </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I am typically a very picky consumer, but I have never wavered once in my admiration of this razor&#x27;s design   and function.  </li>
            <li>This razor will give one a close smooth shave on every area of a female&#x27;s body.</li>
            <li>It is fast, it shaves well and it doesn&#x27;t cost a whole lot.  </li>
            <li>It was time for a REAL Panasonic.</li>
            <li>It is very well make and durable.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the light weight of this shaver fool you - despite that, it feels solid in your hand</li>
            <li>And if you happen to go a day or two without shaving it, you&#x27;re faced with the whole ordeal all over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And I have to agree, for the price of this razor, it performs very well.   </li>
            <li>Also very efective on my son&#x60;s peach fuzz.</li>
            <li>but it looks like it would travel very well,</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Prefer straight razors but they take time and practice.</li>
            <li>My last shaver was a dual blade Panasonic which has a smaller but more useful trimmer that flips out.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this model!  </li>
            <li>The foil is not irritating and fits the contours of my face well.</li>
            <li>I am really liking this razor.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and has the extra trimmer.  </li>
            <li>and I really missed the portability.</li>
            <li>The motor is very underpowered.</li>
            <li>My whiskers grow fast.</li>
            <li>Biggest drawback is it is much louder than the ~$40 shavers.</li>
            <li>Gives a very close shave with some discomfort.</li>
            <li>I should have reposted much sooner</li>
            <li>The shave is probably not as close as you&#x27;d get from some others, but if I want a really close shave</li>
            <li>I guess I would recommend this razor, but don&#x27;t expect a real close shave.  </li>
            <li>He can use it in the shower, on the road, or anywhere he wants.</li>
            <li>Takes longer to shave with only one head but for the price it does shave smooth and a charge lasts just about a week</li>
            <li>he really likes it for the price works</li>
            <li>It cost 3 times as much as this shaver.</li>
            <li>Simple to use and cheap.</li>
            <li>, i really like the wet/dry feature.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After an overnight charge, the battery still lasts a month or so with light daily use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>Well not so fast.</li>
            <li>I gave it to my son who wants a thicker beard, have at it</li>
            <li>but now they offshore much of their work</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t really do the job.</li>
            <li>I think most people are dissapointed because they expect a $30 shaver to give them a shave normally expected from one well over $100.</li>
            <li>All I could find in Local stores was brands I had tried before and did not really have good experiences with.  </li>
            <li>this panasonic is surprisingly quiet, and works well, although i have to run it over my face more times than the old remington.  </li>
            <li>It works best as a wet razor provided that you don&#x27;t use thick shaving cream, rather preapply a skin lotion,</li>
            <li>Easy High 4 stars, even a low 5th star.</li>
            <li>There are things I like better about it compared to other shavers (does well around the neck and is easy to clean), but in general 10 minutes is wayyy to long.  </li>
            <li>Tried it wet shaving at first, but it cut me to the point of bleeding too easily.</li>
            <li>I was a little nervous but after it gave me tht smooth shave, it felt really clean.</li>
            <li>transformer/charger needs more space than other razors</li>
            <li>Wall transformer/charger needs more space than other razors   Not as close as a blade.</li>
            <li>Only used a few times, but very painless/easy shave, and nice being cordless!</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more, phone \\&quot;support\\&quot; is an endless loop of aggravating nonsense.</li>
            <li>Got it for my boyfriend who needs to have a clean shave daily.</li>
            <li>This razor does not provide a clean shave and he has to go over the same spot</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give this particular unit four stars because it gets the job done and was under $100.00 dollars so it was very afordable with wet/dry use.</li>
            <li>The only minor glitch was that the first time I popped off the top to clean it, one of the buttons that holds it on, jammed and the top wouldn&#x27;t go back on.  </li>
            <li>Clean, close, inexpensive, and seems to last forever.</li>
            <li>After reading the multitudes of reviews, some which included phrases such as \\&quot;close and comfortable shave every-time\\&quot; and \\&quot;just as close as a razor\\&quot; etc... I was expecting a little more from the ES-SA40.</li>
            <li>Wow, this thing really works!  </li>
            <li>This time I decided to do some research prior to purchase and the Panasonic came out on top with the most features for the least amount of money.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also pretty loud, louder than my trimmer I use for my goatee.</li>
            <li>I need to find a new screen!</li>
            <li>bulky looking shavers were all that I found and hardly any of them had the pop up trimmer which is great for grooming longer hair prior to shaving.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable and by the time you wear it out, you can either purchase replacement blade and foil or just buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>At Amazon, I got a new foil and blade for a very nominal price.    </li>
            <li>It performs as well as or better than my previous linear shaver from Panasonic at about 1/2 of the price.     </li>
            <li>I do admit that there is a slight burn like any close shave and if this is bothersome a lotion aftershave may be worthwhile.    </li>
            <li>I used the previous model of this shaver for many years until the battery would no longer hold a charge.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the price throw you - this one works better than my triple header ever did, for a lot less money.</li>
            <li>(I use Eucerin Smooth Repair Dry Skin lotion.)</li>
            <li>Personally I&#x27;d rather have it to use than most shavers multiple times the cost.   </li>
            <li>If used for double duty or strictly as a facial shaver, I am confident in recommending this shaver.</li>
            <li>Really love this product and unfortunately they don&#x27;t make them any more.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine what the more expensive Panasonics can offer to be better than this shaver.  </li>
            <li>holds a charge for a decent amount of time.  </li>
            <li>cant beat it for what it does, simple quick shave.</li>
            <li>I found the first time shaving that I needed to shave using the sideburn trimmer first for my entire neck</li>
            <li>Decent shaver from what I can tell, nothing fancy at all.  </li>
            <li>It does an adequate job on short stubble.  </li>
            <li>No, seriously.</li>
            <li>I had a much older model of this shaver and it lasted for over a decade.</li>
            <li>Whether this one in particular deserves 4 stars, I have no idea.</li>
            <li>Along with the single foil design, this allows for very precise shaving - that&#x27;s a key for me, since I have a very angular face.</li>
            <li>The quality of the razor is high grade:  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>My expectations weren&#x27;t high replacing a high end Panasonic that lasted 10 years.</li>
            <li>Bought this razor for my sons who are in High School.  </li>
            <li>It can be cleaned in 30 seconds with a tiny bit of soap and hot water, recharges on a base station quickly, and has an edging slide up blade perfect for finishing touches.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping for a little better.</li>
            <li>also i love the little trimmer thing.</li>
            <li>I get skin irritation, bleed and never gave close shaving leaving complete areas of hair !!</li>
            <li>You have to push hard in order to get a clean shave, but its good enough for a daily trim.</li>
            <li>I suppose a charge level indicator would be nice, but that&#x27;s a feature I&#x27;ve only seen on much more expensive razors.</li>
            <li>The form factor and design we cheap (as expected)</li>
            <li>I got this razor for Christmas, charged it, turned it on and was so happy about the reduction in noise level it could have produced a lousy shave</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d had such good luck with Panasonic in the past that I decided to stick with that brand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased at least five of these shavers for our own use and for gifts.  </li>
            <li>The shaver itself performed OK, but less well than my 2 year old 1-series Braun (which had a working trimmer, btw)</li>
            <li>I never had a problem with it catching skin, but every time I use it there are a half dozen to a dozen hairs left</li>
            <li>Luckily, I have a light beard and this shaver seems to do the trick!  (been using for approximately one month)  </li>
            <li>This shaver gives as good a shave as other more expensive wet/dry Panasonics I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>right to left (so basically 4 shaves).  </li>
            <li>This simple shaver works well, especially so wet,  better than my much more expensive, arguably technically superior dry-shave only Braun.   </li>
            <li>:  This razor charges by being snapped directly into a wall transformer, so if your bathroom plug is not oriented with one plug under another or is in a tight spot, you may not be able to use this razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This razor charges by being snapped directly into a wall transformer, so if your bathroom plug is not oriented with one plug under another or is in a tight spot, you may not be able to use this razor.    </li>
            <li>It is too new to determine durability.</li>
            <li>so I decided to buy something new.  </li>
            <li>and it is still working like new.</li>
            <li>still running like new.</li>
            <li>BUT I&#x27;m new to electric shavers and this may be a norm.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my new one for over 3 weeks</li>
            <li>Just buy a new shaver every 2-3 years.</li>
            <li>live in China, and I cannot find an electric razor of this quality at this price in my city.</li>
            <li>I live in the US.</li>
            <li>Even brand new with fresh blades it had a hard time giving me the not-so-close shave my cheap Braun gave me.   </li>
            <li>Being able to rinse the razor instead of the expensive cartridge cleaning system that My Braun uses is a HUGE plus.</li>
            <li>You then have to clean it carefully to recover function.</li>
            <li>I liked the close shave of a traditional shave and previous electric shavers would irritate and burn my sensitive skin and pull at my beard.   </li>
            <li>Not quite as smooth as the current state of razor blades, but close enough.    </li>
            <li>if you are looking for ALL OUT facial hair shaver/trimmer, spend the few hundred bucks to get a mac daddy kind</li>
            <li>My old shaver finally gave out after several years of fine service.</li>
            <li>Panasonic delivered and great product in the past; and I expect nothing less from this razor--</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I have nicked myself multiple times (learning curve: my first electric razor).  </li>
            <li>But now the price is $55 for the exact same model.</li>
            <li>I bought this for a relative in a nursing home, but wanted to try it first.</li>
            <li>At first I said this, \\&quot;This is the only electric shaver I have used that I like.  </li>
            <li>It has since dulled slightly, but it works fine.</li>
            <li>I use it daily and needed to charge it once over the first 4 weeks.</li>
            <li>To get an even closer shave this can simply be taken into a hot shower.</li>
            <li>and I have to say - wow!  </li>
            <li>It out performs several of the higher dollar shavers that I have owned.</li>
            <li>Now, I used razors my entire life and this was the first electric razor I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>I had left my first Panasonic shaver at mom&#x27;s house, and began to shave with a disposable twin blade razor--with it, I drew blood twice.  </li>
            <li>Because the ES-Sa40 can be used wet, I knew full well that it has a cordless charge design</li>
            <li>I am down to like 3 or 4 minutes and can&#x27;t believe it is so smooth.</li>
            <li>With that in mind it&#x27;s simpler to just buy a complete new razor.    </li>
            <li>I first searched for a ladies version, ugh, pink, mauve, really gaudy, and</li>
            <li>Firstly, I will state that I am a 26-year-old male with extremely sensitive skin, prone to acne and razor-burn.  </li>
            <li>I have to admit, the first time I tried using shaving cream with this razor I was skeptical - but the results were astounding.</li>
            <li>I had a Panasonic as my next to last razor, and really liked it, couldn&#x27;t replace it at the time (discontinued) and had Braun for 4 or 5 years that eventually slowed down so much new foils and blades didn&#x27;t even help.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic works great for small jobs, it doesn&#x27;t do very well on my neck area because my hair lays down flat.</li>
            <li>I got this razor based on the low price and all the positive reviews, but it just doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me.</li>
            <li>For less than one third the price of my fancier Panasonic shaver, I&#x27;d say this one shaves about 90% (or better) as close.</li>
            <li>i had a 10yr old remington that was decent, but the mesh was deteriorating, and thought i would just buy a new shaver for about the same price as the new mesh.      </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so large it takes up both outlets in a standard bathroom.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I am that hard to please and my beard can&#x27;t be any tougher than most.</li>
            <li>My old Braun system 3 probably gave a slightly better shave, but at 1/5th the price it is hard to beat the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to now have the closest shave I have ever gotten with an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried nearly every multi-blade manual razor out there.  </li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>I had a Panasonic wet/dry shaver that was getting a bit old and noisy</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with this razor.</li>
            <li>so it does double duty and performs very well.</li>
            <li>it charges by sitting in a dock that plugs directly into the outlet, so</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin because i have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and it hasn&#x27;t given me any rash so far.</li>
            <li>If you´re looking for a shaver for your sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I was looking for a shaver to replace my old Braun foil shaver.  </li>
            <li>Second, the comfort level and closeness of the shave is outstanding, especially when using wet.</li>
            <li>If you want a really close shave go back to your 5 blade plastic wonders.  </li>
            <li>Not only do you have to be careful about not cutting yourself (which I&#x27;ve done on far too many occasions), but you can spend ten or twenty minutes going over every bit only to find an hour later</li>
            <li>Unlike my old rotary razor, I get a lot of coverage on the razor&#x27;s foil with which to run the razor over my head.  </li>
            <li>The shaver plugs directly into the \\&quot;wall wart\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>This item is a bit noiser than the old model, but performs as well.</li>
            <li>I appreciate the cordless charging feature, allowing it to plug directly into electric receptacle.</li>
            <li>old son and one for me.</li>
            <li>but I really miss the cord when the charge starts pooping out in the middle of a shave.</li>
            <li>If you want an inexpensive shaver that does it&#x27;s job very well, look no further.  </li>
            <li>this shaver cut my 3 day old hairs effortlessly.  </li>
            <li>First one lasted a long time, until the battery stopped recharging.  </li>
            <li>wow.  </li>
            <li>It is too early to give a complete opinion as I have used for about 10 days.</li>
            <li>and so far holds a charge well.  </li>
            <li>this was close to my old shaver.  </li>
            <li>It does not shave as close as my old shaver.</li>
            <li>so this time time around I decided to go for the cheapest one and I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>As mentioned in the title of this review, however, you need to be careful with this powerful device.  </li>
            <li>Its controls are simple and the razor foil gently glides over my head and face and provides an adequate shave for daily maintenance of my head, and for a decent enough facial appearance for the weekends.  </li>
            <li>he loves it, especially as it is a wet /dry shaver, definite benefit is the charger that plugs in the wall, the unit does the job when it comes to the in between shaves for sure.</li>
            <li>Like others have said, it gives a very close shave with a little burn, but I shave right before I take a shower, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  </li>
            <li>My head hair and facial hair is very fine and dry, which probably made it more difficult for this type of razor to lift and cut the hair.  </li>
            <li>I just wash my face and leave it wet, then shave and the results are still far better than I&#x27;ve ever had with any other electric shaver.</li>
            <li>It has never let me down, always runs perfectly, is so easy to hold onto, and will give me a shave that is unsurpassed in comparison to electric razors that are made especially for women.</li>
            <li>Another huge advantage to this thing is that I have had it a month now, and other than the initial overnight charge, I have never charged it once.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be lucky if two hairs get shaved down, and even then the shave on those two hairs will be substandard.</li>
            <li>Unlike my previous razors, this shaver&#x27;s charging adaptor serves as a nice little stand which allows you to complete a charge in eight hours.</li>
            <li>Single head-shaves much better than more expensive double or triple head models.</li>
            <li>For the price, it does about the same thing as my older (deceased) braun 150 series.</li>
            <li>I bought this mainly for travel and occasional use at home.</li>
            <li>I finally started my quest to find a decent alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic ES-SA40-K Pro Curve Wet/Dry Shaver</li>
            <li>So long as I have electricity, the Panasonic wins over the throwaway double blade razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Battery life is decent too, I&#x27;d say you get about solid 8 minutes of maximum RPM&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s funny that one of Panasonic&#x27;s best shavers is the least expensive one!</li>
            <li>It also never gets as clean as other people claim it does or as simply.</li>
            <li>I do not recommend using it wet, I found that with wet hair the sideburn trimmer will clog easily and pinch you or tug at your skin.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a fine little shaver.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small, light, and works well.  </li>
            <li>Small, light, portable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would however not expect for it to be the only shaving unit , if you have normal growth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a regular person, no hard hair or anything</li>
            <li>Perhaps my facial hair type is really different (not thick, a little on the light side)</li>
            <li>The second paragraph is my original review and shows my previous endorsement of the product.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t like the new ones and wish I could have these back!</li>
            <li>The operating instructions do indicate that my face needs one month to adjust to this new razor, and I have only been using it for one week.</li>
            <li>The loss of portability and the fact that I needed a new foil and blade, I decided to try this Panasonic ES-SA40-K because the entire shaver cost about the same as a new foil and blade for the Braun.</li>
            <li>I use Scrubbing Bubbles to clean off the shaving cream scum and the shaver looks like it did when it was new.  </li>
            <li>The replacement blades and foils are so expensive that once you figure in shipping, it is usually only a couple dollars more to buy a whole new shaver.</li>
            <li>Oh and by the way, this is dry saving, not into the foamy stuff much.</li>
            <li>I had an old Braun ~ 20 years old that worked well, but finally died.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t recommend this shaver for daily or even occasional use.</li>
            <li>The only strange thing about this shaver is the complete unit costs as much as the replacement foil.  </li>
            <li>This shaver seems to be working very well, but especially in the first few months.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that might be a little odd is the charger, but it stores nice without the cord.</li>
            <li>It is however definitely worth the 25 dollars if you&#x27;re on a tight budget.</li>
            <li>I have used it wet and dry and the result is the same, a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Wet dry shavers are for light water use and in the instructions tell you the proper way to use these with water.</li>
            <li>The built-in beard trimmer is a little unusual in design, but it actually works out very well.</li>
            <li>Generally in the $30.00 range.</li>
            <li>For work, when I know I will have an important meeting late in the day, I can throw this in my briefcase and know I&#x27;m covered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No pink or mauve anywhere.</li>
            <li>After 10 minutes of trying to shave with this thing, and barely shaving any hair off, I gave up and pulled out my razor.</li>
            <li>I shave nearly every day with this (probably 5-10 minutes per shave) and only need one overnight charge per week.</li>
            <li>I spent as much time tweezing as I did shaving.</li>
            <li>but I had to do some work to get all the hair off: going over the hair multiple times, and you will most likely have to use the secondary trimmer to finish up.   </li>
            <li>The simple charger &#x27;brick&#x27; plugs directly into the wall socket with the shaver snaping into the brick...and precludes the need for a recharge cord.  </li>
            <li>No, this thing takes several passes on day old stubble to pick it up.  </li>
            <li>Back to my old Remington</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my old Panasonic ES4025 when the battery finally died after 4 years.  </li>
            <li>If you are tired of paying hundreds of dollars for the the latest Braun, give this a try.  </li>
            <li>In a high altitude cooler and dry climate.</li>
            <li>Over the past 20 years, I have used many of the 2 &amp; 3 blade Panasonic shavers, but I keep coming back to the single blade.  </li>
            <li>I can actually tell by the sound, when it is cutting beard and when the area is clean.  </li>
            <li>I like everything about the razor other than not getting a real close shave.  </li>
            <li>Impressed with the smooth shave, and sick of paying for expensive blades for my regular razor,  I decided to buy a rechargeable shaver for myself.</li>
            <li>With each new shaver the cost of the blade and foil assembly replacement seemed to approach the price of a completely new shaver with less features.  </li>
            <li>I sort of expected that it would at least be able to cut hair.</li>
            <li>Takes quite a while to fully charge, but not a big deal since i&#x27;m only using a few minutes at a time to do a quick shave in the morning.</li>
            <li>It provides a decently close shave and you can get it as wet as you like.</li>
            <li>This shaver is LOUD, it sends out a high frequency buzz that is most unpleasant.  </li>
            <li>This gets closer than most, but I still find I need to revert to a manual razor at least one every other week.</li>
            <li>I kept my 7526 alive for as long as I could</li>
            <li>I wish I would have replaced my old one a long time before.</li>
            <li>After trying it a few times in the shower, I can pretty much conclude it doesn&#x27;t work either wet or dry.</li>
            <li>The first one was two years old and the foil finally started getting dull.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how long the shaver will last, but the price is low enough that it would not be unreasonable to buy a replacement head or an entirely new shaver multiple times per year.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaper than most ladies shavers, slimmer, holds its charge for a long time, has a little plastic snap-on cover to protect the roller, and it&#x27;s black!</li>
            <li>I always have trouble just under my jaw on my neck, can&#x27;t get a clean shave in less that like 6 or 7 minutes.</li>

            <li> The razor works great in the shower too if you prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Panasonic was a great company when they manufactured in Japan</li>
            <li> This product is a great value:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Why spend 2-3xs more if you don&#x27;t have to!!</li>
            <li> Very nice shaver.</li>
            <li> This shaver does a nice job, but it takes me 10 minutes!  </li>
            <li> I have owned mostly Braun as I thought they were the best</li>
            <li> ES-SA40-K works great, holds a good charge.</li>
            <li> Out of the box, it had a strong charge and shaved great!    </li>
            <li> Excellent Shaver great for a quick shave.</li>
            <li> I chose the ES-SA40-K because it had a fine price and excellent reviews.    </li>
            <li> I love it and get very good shaves.</li>
            <li> It does fairly well without preshave or shaving cream.</li>
            <li> and every shave, thereafter, has been just as good.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on the basis of good reviews here and that I had never tried a Wet/Dry shaver before.  </li>
            <li> Sounds wise huh?  </li>
            <li> Well it is wise.</li>
            <li> Good in the shower also.</li>
            <li> The day came, and I received my shaver, nice style, great grip...</li>
            <li> I got this razor after reading the good reviews.</li>
            <li> just never cut, so I thought I&#x27;d try the Panasonic ES-SA40-K which got fairly good reviews.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with good ol&#x27; shaving cream and a Bic.</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s a good electric razor.</li>
            <li> Feel like it is a good  product for the price.   </li>
            <li> Nothing fancy, just reliable shaving with good results.</li>
            <li> I get a close shave, ergonomics are good and with an 8 hour charge it will run about a week.</li>
            <li> but the Remington was just as good</li>
            <li> The battery is not quite as good as the others but the shave is and that&#x27;s all that counts along with the price.</li>
            <li> It is a good value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a top-of-the-line model and it didn&#x27;t do nearly as good a job on my neck as this</li>
            <li> Good shaver for a good price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying this because I&#x27;ve always had good luck with Panasonic products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Admittedly, the shave is not as close as what I got with the Brauns, but for me this is a fantastic compliment to blade shaving, and the perfect travel and mid-day business razor.  </li>
            <li> I figured it had to be good if it cost $300 bucks</li>
            <li> The Braun did good</li>
            <li> I had a 4 head microscreen that did not do as good a job.</li>
            <li> The prise is good; however, the product is even better!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price, and the performance is excellent.   </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very satisfied with this shaver and plan to buy a spare in case</li>
            <li> It works great even in the shower, I love that I can use it without worrying that water will damage it.</li>
            <li> when i saw the package it looked very stylish and durable.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t tested the battery life yet, but am very pleased with the shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for about a month now and am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very pleased that I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the performance and price of the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Very Very pleased.</li>
            <li> None of them give you the best shave around the neck, but the Panasonic ES-SA40-K Pro Curve Wet/Dry Shaver, single blade has done the best of all of them.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s resting right on those blades.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, perfect for me.</li>
            <li> the shape is nice, the recharger is nice, battery life is good after a year&#x27;s use.  </li>
            <li> I love this electric, wet-dry razor!</li>
            <li> The sideburn trimmer appears to work somewhat more effectively, however, this is going to be returned!</li>
            <li> Still, that&#x27;s pretty impressive in my book.</li>
            <li> more than this machine ($25.99)!   </li>
            <li> Very good rechargeable shaver used for weekend shaves when a super close blade shave not needed.</li>
            <li> Trimmer excellent and quality very high.</li>
            <li> All in all amazing for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the fanciest razor, but for the money it&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li> plugged up in the bathroom for handy use.</li>
            <li> I bought one for my brother and now he&#x27;s loving it too.  </li>
            <li> Save a couple more bucks and go for a good shaver.</li>
            <li> honestly, i bought this shaver because of the price.  </li>
            <li> 3-4 (+) times for it to actually be effective.  </li>
            <li> the wet/dry option is really nice too.</li>
            <li> It feels nice, has a nice charger that holds it up on the wall.</li>
            <li> I just got this and it cuts nice and close.</li>
            <li> This is a nice model for a teenager to use at the dorms.  </li>
            <li> This electric shaver is nice for the price.</li>
            <li> I saw so many good reviews I decided to take a chance on this shaver.</li>
            <li> For the price it has many good features.</li>
            <li> if u want clean cut use razor, this trimmer is great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the best on the neck, have to spend a decent amount of time to get all the hairs.</li>
            <li> The battery seems very strong and I recharge after every 3 or 4 uses.</li>
            <li> Very nice razor for a quick shave.  </li>
            <li> It provided a solution to a specialized problem and it has proven to be safe and effective.  </li>
            <li> Best shave so far.</li>
            <li> Maybe when he goes out into the professional world he will want and need a higher-end model, but this is perfect for now.</li>
            <li> Works great right out the box.  </li>
            <li> It is light and easily taken with me on trips, or used to \\&quot;tidy up\\&quot; if I want to go out without looking like Richard Nixon!</li>
            <li> Very cheap</li>
            <li> Its great, fast, holds a charge nicely, and rinses easily.</li>
            <li> Does not shave as good as a bigger model but is nice for travel, compact and easy to pack and that is great.</li>
            <li> I shave in the shower and have used many of the Panasonic wet/dry shavers.  </li>
            <li> Some better than others.  </li>
            <li> For some puzzling reason, this electric shaver works better around my mustache and chin than a blade.  </li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s water proof.</li>
            <li> All around an awesome razor especially for the price.</li>
            <li> no matter how many times I went over them.  </li>
            <li> It works as well or better than any electrical shaver I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all too pleased.</li>
            <li> allow me to shave safely in the shower     2.</li>
            <li> it has sufficient weight and   balance to use it confidently with plenty of control and feedback.  </li>
            <li> Even more, it gave me the smoothest shave ever</li>
            <li> I have been using Panasonic razors for many years and was always pleased with them.</li>
            <li> More that a year with one.</li>
            <li> and i love it..</li>
            <li> And my husband shaves more often.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t need a 2 or more blades to shave.  </li>
            <li> Most electric shavers can&#x27;t reach the hairs under my jawbone, but this one can.</li>
            <li> Most days, I don&#x27;t bother with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> is the perfect combination of performance and low cost.  </li>
            <li> It has been a worthwhile purchase.  </li>
            <li> like it even better than my $80</li>
            <li> because they offer better shaves from a selection of lower priced units according to review sites.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s all planned obsolescents for greater profit per quarter&#x27;.</li>
            <li> It should also be noted that the shaver does vibrate more than what I am used to and does not possess a corded</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;shaver\\&quot; works ok on the majority of my face, but under my chin it does nothing but cause pain.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> I also am not the kind of guy who needs to have baby smooth face.  </li>
            <li> Well, after using it for a month, I am extremely pleased with this shaver.  </li>
            <li> No way you find a better electric shaver for under $30.</li>
            <li> I have many, many hairs that the shaver will just not get and have to be tweezed.</li>
            <li> am still glad that I have the ES-SA40.</li>
            <li> I am still glad that I have the ES-SA40.</li>
            <li> On top of that the shave is close</li>
            <li> I owned it for over a month and am satisfied with the purchase.   </li>
            <li> I love this Razor -</li>
            <li> Seems like a better idea than buying one for 5 times the cost.</li>
            <li> I have owned somewhere about 30  electric shavers and have found the one blade shavers do a better job than the 2-3-4 blade shavers (and there cheaper).</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love it but cannot find ability to order another on Amazon.</li>
            <li> One more thing to research before purchasing.</li>
            <li> ok.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for about 4 years now, and still love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The outlet mount charger is better for me, but may not work for others.  </li>
            <li> It also hurts my face more than a manual razor would.</li>
            <li> aside, you aren&#x27;t going to do much better for the price.</li>
            <li> Love the charger, love the feel of the unit, love it all.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe they don&#x27;t charge more for these.</li>
            <li> I have had this more than a year and still shaving like it&#x27;s supposed to.  </li>
            <li> 20 years ago this was my favorite razor, then it seemed to disappear from the market.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Holds a charge for many many shaves&lt;br /&gt;compact&lt;br /&gt;easy</li>
            <li> I urge anyone that wants a great shave, this is  one you should buy.</li>
            <li> If you are in a hurry and need an ok shaver...</li>
            <li> Battery life is ok.</li>
            <li> This looked like a great idea - and some things really work:  </li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this razor.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shaver.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a low cost shaver, this one it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic doesn&#x27;t shave quite as close, but it is quieter, more ergonomic, has a better blade cover, and has a unique, effective charger.</li>
            <li> So far, so good!</li>
            <li> when fully charged it works GREAT - holds a charge for a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> Clean up a breeze, and that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> well, light, very easy to use and charge.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a high powered computer that includes everything and comes at a great deal, except</li>
            <li> It works great with lather and almost as good dry.</li>
            <li> It operates in both wet/dry conditions, and always produces a very clean and close shave, and for me ALWAYS without any razor burn.  </li>
            <li> Nevertheless this $30 shaver gives me a very clean shave.</li>
            <li> It has a pretty good battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a pretty good battery life.    </li>
            <li> a good first shaver.</li>
            <li> Bought the es-sa40-k since it&#x27;s almost exactly like the older Panasonic model which worked perfectly for six years.</li>
            <li> Being able to use it in the shower is nice but in reality I rarely use it it the shower.</li>
            <li> Being able to use it in the shower is nice but in reality I rarely use it it the shower.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t impress easily, but I&#x27;m enjoying using this shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always bought the \\&quot;basic\\&quot; Panasonic shaver as it always gave a good shave, was very inexpensive and like most shavers disposable as the battery cannot be replaced.  </li>
            <li> Seems to work better and is definitely more comfortable in the shower.</li>
            <li> Has a nice wall charger and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES-SA40-K Pro Curve Wet/Dry Shaver single blade gives me the best shave for the cost.  </li>
            <li> for single blade this is probably the best shaver i have ever had</li>
            <li> This is most certainly not the greatest razor, as it does have difficulties with longer hairs.</li>
            <li> I liked the product was what I expected and very good quality to recommend them all very good product when I can come back to buy</li>
            <li> Light in the hand and gives as good a shave as many higher priced products.  </li>
            <li> This unit shaves pretty good the drawback I found is trimmer for side burns don&#x27;t cut so easily but don&#x27;t pull hairs either</li>
            <li> I am thrilled that I can use shaving cream to soften my beard and the cleanup under the faucet is quick and easy.  </li>
            <li> While it isn&#x27;t as close or clean as a regular razor, it is perfect for my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> This cheap electric shaver turns on and make lovely sounds</li>
            <li> The closest, most comfortable shave in the shower.</li>
            <li> This shaver is great as it gives a close shave but is not harsh on your face.  </li>
            <li> If you buy one, I&#x27;m sure you will enjoy it, and you may find yourself wishing everything was made this well.</li>
            <li> It does a good job in a reasonable amount of time.  </li>
            <li> This one is also easy to clean and the foil has a nice fit to the shaver itself.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean!</li>
            <li> First the good, the item shipped quickly, was well packaged, and appears stylish.  </li>
            <li> This is a very useful shaver for most men.  </li>
            <li> This means that I can shave my head more quickly and confidently.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a shaver that had a single head, no swivel, and this fit the bill perfectly.  </li>
            <li> How cool is that?!</li>
            <li> There may be equal or even better shavers for a much higher price, but this is my best experience.  </li>
            <li> and then they are easy to shave.    </li>
            <li> The pop-up trim is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> transformer/charger keeps razor off of counter.&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable and easy to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good performance on a budget  Works well on the scalp  Great for everyday use.    </li>
            <li> The pop-up trimmer is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> easy to use and charge.</li>
            <li> It is compact and easy to maneuver around my hairline (I have a gotee).</li>
            <li> Easy cleaning    </li>
            <li> I have paid as much as $150.00 for electric shavers in my battle against razor bumps, but this by far the best shaver that I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> I have not charged mine up in 2 weeks and it is still running strong.</li>
            <li> Decided to purchase this particular one because it good reviews and was easy on the wallet.  </li>
            <li> Strong motor, lots of zooms.  </li>
            <li> I like the fact it is easy to clean and the straight cutter is good for sideburns.  </li>
            <li> The quality of materials is very high, the fit and finish is exceptional.    </li>
            <li> Braun razors hands down were the best razors that you could get until gillette /proctor-gamble acquired the company in 2005.</li>
            <li> I would say it hasn&#x27;t sped up my shaving process, but its nice to be able on a whim to get a quick trim, without having to use lather and hot water.</li>
            <li> this Panasonic ES-SA40-K Pro is your best choice for less money.</li>
            <li> Comfortable and easy to hold.   </li>
            <li> and it is still working fine.  </li>
            <li> It works fine, no oxidation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and fits my hand fine.  </li>
            <li> Always thought one head would be less of a perfect shave.  </li>
            <li> trimmer does it&#x27;s job, but I don&#x27;t have a beard or mustache, so maybe that&#x27;s why it works fine for</li>
            <li> However, it quickly became my favorite razor.</li>
            <li> my skin is super sensitive and this feels great.</li>
            <li> If you are searching for a good shaver, that is strong and last for some time for sure</li>
            <li> This is good for a quick shave/touchup, but it isn&#x27;t great for everyday shaving.</li>
            <li> mostly use a razor to shave but find this very useful to deal with 5 O&#x27;clock shadow or a quick weekend shave.</li>
            <li> The trimmer was a huge problem for this shaver.  </li>
            <li> I have a mustache, and this shaves and trims accurately and closely.</li>
            <li> thank you Amazon for such great quality products.</li>
            <li> The smooth slim design allows for ease of use on curved areas, underarms, knees etc.</li>
            <li> Really enjoy how it feels and works.</li>
            <li> I actually use this to shave my head--works great.  </li>
            <li> I use it in the shower which makes it easy to rinse clean.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I read the instructions and all and tried and tried but it wouldnt do anything besides a sound.   </li>
            <li> It did clean up easily under running water.</li>
            <li> This razor is easy to clean and maintain.  </li>
            <li> The last one is still in great working condition, but has been put away as a backup for me.</li>
            <li> For the low price I was kind of worried it would not work very well, but it works great.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I had no intention of using this - it&#x27;s headed to my son in Afghanistan.  </li>
            <li> close and comfortable shave everytime.</li>
            <li> I bought this one because the replacement parts are relatively cheap.  </li>
            <li> Feels cheap and the sideburns trimer feels really cheap</li>
            <li> I have what I consider a moderate beard and the shaver works great on all areas of the face and neck.</li>
            <li> My \\&quot;beard\\&quot; is light, which helps, but I have never even had to change the blades.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic is a good-looking wet/dry shaver with an outer foil which easily pops off so that it can be rinsed clean with water.</li>
            <li> I had another cheap razor before this one that I lost, which I am going to purchase again after this experience.</li>
            <li> It is light weight, yet it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap, but rather well built.</li>
            <li> and it is  easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver for the cost!It is quiet and gives a close shave.</li>
            <li> Wish it was available again</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave as closely as husband&#x27;s Gillette Mach3 Turbo razor, but he&#x27;s happy with the overall quality of this shaver.</li>
            <li> This shaver is easy to clean, and I have tested it in the water.</li>
            <li> I would not use this as your primary shaver.</li>
            <li> Now, I primarily shave with a blade in the shower, and then follow up with this in front of the mirror.  </li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s important to you (??).</li>
            <li> Using a duplex to 6 outlet adapter, the charger takes up 2 of the 6 outlets, leaving 4 free.  </li>
            <li> Some reviews claimed that it was great while others seemed to think that it was only so-so.</li>
            <li> and it never give smooth</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> I have been a Norelco user for many years but never seem to get a really close shave even after many passes.</li>
            <li> overall i&#x27;m satisfied with this panasonic and for the price, it&#x27;s a good value.</li>
            <li> This shaver really does a great job shaving very close to the skin</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean and provides a nice smooth shave for someone who cannot, or does not want to, deal with a high maintenance cordless shaver.</li>
            <li> allowed triming of longer (half-inch) beard growth in areas that had escaped my regular razor for a month (this was accoplished with the very effective sideburn and beard trimming cutter built into the razor).    </li>
            <li> Pros:  Quick, easy, and relatively smooth</li>
            <li> At first I was like, OK does about as good as my old Remmy but gave it a week anyway to see if things might improve.</li>
            <li> I am saving money by not longer shaving in a hot shower. :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure they don&#x27;t have medicine cabinets in tents.</li>
            <li> This shaver performs ok, about the same as most, but there are probably ones that shave closer (for more money).  </li>
            <li> The higher end Panasonic shavers may work better.  </li>
            <li> Replaced another Panasonic shaver that lasted 14 years with this unit and love this one just as much!</li>
            <li> Battery lasts forever, and after 4 years I&#x27;m still on my original head and foil.  </li>
            <li> i really love this thing, it cuts the hair good and it doesnt feel like its pulling the hair out like alot of other cheap</li>
            <li> I had an older Panasonic shaver that I had for 7 years and when I needed a new one, I was happy to find the newer improved version of what I had.</li>
            <li> It gives me a clean shave without a lot of effort.  </li>
            <li> i do like the fact that i can run it under water to rinse it clean.  </li>
            <li> If I might be gross, it is far and away the best inside the ear and inside the nose shaver I have ever used.</li>
            <li> i use it to clean up the rest of my face after a line up</li>
            <li> B000050FDQ Braun 7526 Syncro Shaver System with Clean &amp; Charge Storage Stand]]</li>
            <li> I use it &#x27;dry&#x27;, but have, on occasion, used it in the shower with great results.  </li>
            <li> it is beautifully built by panasonic and it has never failed to give peak performance even though i have been  using it for several years.</li>
            <li> Razor works great for a single foil cutter.</li>
            <li> It shaves really close and it glides very smooth across my face.</li>
            <li> it shaves OK, but not as good as other electric dual-head shavers.  </li>
            <li> AC adapter/charger (a bit large, but doubles as a make-shift counter top stand for your shaver when not in use)  </li>
            <li> I was pleased with the very first shave - comfortable, and very close . . .</li>
            <li> After the second shave I wanted to say that is actually a very good shaver for the price you get, actually its better than the price.</li>
            <li> firstly, all the great reviews and then of course the low price.</li>
            <li> My husband has never liked electric shavers, so an inexpensive one was the best way to test if he&#x27;d use it.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, the charger is fairly nice - no messy chord.  </li>
            <li> Lasts about 3 full shaves in between charges, and still runs after that, but I can feel it getting sluggish.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly good performance from such an inexpensive product.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re looking for the full package.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my teenage nephew, he loved it.  </li>
            <li> Good value was a lot cheaper than others and does the same job</li>
            <li> This is better than razors that cost twice as much.</li>
            <li> Used to be a Remington man, but they discontinued their very good low end model in lieu of a new crappy one.</li>
            <li> The Braun foils seemed to be wearing out much more quickly than they used to also, and the price for a replacement foil and cutter was almost as much as the Panasonic costs.</li>
            <li> The shaver leaves some felt stubble right after I&#x27;m done shaving but which turns smooth to the touch after applying after shave.</li>
            <li> It is quieter and provides better shave quality than the older one (ES8077 wet/dry linear model) at a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li> This unit is a tremendous value for the purchase price.</li>
            <li> shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Smooth and non-irritating on the skin, easy to clean, very fast.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> It outperforms my older Panasonic rechargeable with almost a week more use.  </li>
            <li> This razor is decent, however don&#x27;t expect a top shaving experience from it.</li>
            <li> Without reservation I highly recommend both of these shavers, and will buy two more as backups.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had very good luck with Panasonic products in the past.</li>
            <li> It is good for a quick shave as long as you are not wanted a \\&quot;CLEAN\\&quot; shave.</li>
            <li> then some...very very very close shave and very powerful had it for almost a year n</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this razor for about 5 weeks now and am very satisfied with the performance, especially for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> Easy operation (large on/off switch, ergonomic grip)  </li>
            <li> My father had an older Panasonic and liked it so much (still working) that he asked me to send him one of these.</li>
            <li> The sale price wasn&#x27;t much more than a new cutter/screen set, so I just bought another shaver for myself and one for a son.  </li>
            <li> Had one of these many years ago, and when I needed a new one....</li>
            <li> I took it easy and didn&#x27;t get much irritation.</li>
            <li> It shaves much faster than an older two foil shaver, is much more comfortable, shaves just as close and is not as noisy.</li>
            <li> As a dry shaver, I miss a lot of those curly rascals and eventually have to use a razor if I want a really good shave.</li>
            <li> As usual, ordering and shipment from Amazon was fast and flawless.</li>
            <li> After first use, I can´t believe it!</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES-SA40-K Pro Curve Wet/Dry Shaver, is the best simple single blade shaver that I have used.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended, particularly in my specialized kind of application.</li>
            <li> really durable and works fine in the shower.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much except you have to be sure to clean it frequently.</li>
            <li> And for the money, it is a great little shaver.</li>
            <li> This is a great little shaver for the money.</li>
            <li> but it is a great little guy for the price.</li>
            <li> Plus, the entire time I owned it (it worked fine for most of it&#x27;s life)</li>
            <li> Great for the day to day shaving if a razor is too harsh.  </li>
            <li> Either this is just a &#x27;me&#x27; thing, maybe some people stop shaving turn the unit over, use both hands and then pop the trimmer up, but I like to be able to do it seamlessly.</li>
            <li> I went ahead and bought one and rarely get ingrown hairs.     </li>
            <li> Ok on the face for my husband,  but my son has sensitive skin and it chews up his face too.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used more expensive shavers and this one is just as good as most of them.  </li>
            <li> Pictures don&#x27;t show it, but this shaver plugs directly into the top of the wall wart that plugs into the outlet.</li>
            <li> and  then it ain&#x27;t worth</li>
            <li> Worth the money I made my parents pay for it.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m pleased with the shaving performance for the price you pay.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> but if it lasts just a couple of years it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> My old shavers were Braun, Wahl, and Panasonic, all being the cheaper models and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I found these reviews and figured $40, what the heck, worth a shot.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews...</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work if you have more than a minimum soft beard.  </li>
            <li> My young boys love this razor</li>
            <li> Not quite as powerful but does the job,</li>
            <li> Well worth the money I paid for it.</li>
            <li> So for me it wasn&#x27;t as easy and care free as I thought it would be, but I want to make it clear that it is the first shave</li>
            <li> The motor is powerful, it shaves really closely (almost as good as a razor), it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and it is pretty quiet.</li>
            <li> Low price, good shave, and a trimmer that works decently.  </li>
            <li> the price is right for this one.</li>
            <li> You read that right.  </li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> I have always been very happy with my previous Panasonic wet/dry shavers, but this one did not indicate that the side trimmer (for sideburns) would work only on sideburns.  </li>
            <li> and I will not be able to do a quick shave regardless of the current charge status.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely thrilled with this fine little machine.  </li>
            <li> and it does great for nose hair and small amounts of side</li>
            <li> The razor was great until I put a small dent in the foil screen, now it was to cut skin or rip hair.  </li>
            <li> Nice no cord charger, and long run time.</li>
            <li> Light weight, powerful, reasonably priced, well designed charger, shaves heavy growth well, no skin irritation, very easy to clean with 409 spray cleaner and water.  </li>
            <li> Looks cheap but use great, the charger only works for wall sockets due to its orientation.</li>
            <li> I love the flat blade on the back since it&#x27;s so effective on the neck</li>
            <li> It was just about as cheap to buy a new one as it was to replace the foil and cutter block.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s more happy with the money he saves on all of those expensive Mach 3 Turbo replacement blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used some of the Remington&#x27;s and Norelco&#x27;s, but the extra cost didn&#x27;t produce any better shave than these economical Panasonic models.  </li>
            <li> The shaver is good for a trim but does not provide the close shave that I typically get from a manual razor.</li>
            <li> The razor (on Amazon) is only $5.00 more than these replacements and if I hit the site right shipping is included.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect this to be the equal of a new blade shave but for low cost very good results beyond my expectations.</li>
            <li> It worked great until the other day when I dropped it and it quit completely.</li>
            <li> Razor blades very quickly lose their edge with me, after 2 shaves a Power Fusion blade feels rough, while friends get 6 or more very satisfactory shaves from them</li>
            <li> The single head is more than adequate.  </li>
            <li> Great little shaver!!</li>
            <li> The rechargeable battery is NiMH, which means that it is okay to leave it fully charged most of the time - no need to drain it down like the older NiCad batteries.</li>
            <li> Now I always have a perfectly clean razor that looks like new.  </li>
            <li> You can tell in the first 20 seconds, this is a shaver of your dreams.  </li>
            <li> This is also the first time I used a non-rotary electric shaver.    </li>
            <li> This is the first wet/dry razor I have owned.  </li>
            <li> Initially the shaver worked flawlessly but 3 months later the power simply fizzes out even though I keep it charged.  </li>
            <li> so this was my first time using any shaver.</li>
            <li> However, it takes some time to get a consistent shave.</li>
            <li> However, when I used it for the first time, I felt no pulls or nicks, my skin was not irritated and...</li>
            <li> First, the feel.</li>
            <li> and I find this is able to shave next to it without pulling on the longer hairs.</li>
            <li> Actually, I charge that often more out of caution than necessity, since the razor still has charge on it when I plug it</li>
            <li> Heads and foil for most razors are simply overpriced!</li>
            <li> The batteries have never failed on any of my razors.</li>
            <li> It is the first one of this model.  </li>
            <li> Its my second and Its much better than the hand-me-down shaver</li>
            <li> This shaver shaves on the first pass so in about 15-20 seconds I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> This is my first Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li> but once you get the hang of it and brake it in, it&#x27;s much better than a regular razor for day to day use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Battery died in first two weeks.</li>
            <li> The WES9979P replacement blade and foil kit costs more than the entire travel shaver itself.  </li>
            <li> And for only $30 it doesn&#x27;t get much better.</li>
            <li> So I used this shaver for the first time</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re interested in buying this razor, I recommend it and there are still places which sell it for under $30.</li>
            <li> Have had it 3 years and it never fails.</li>
            <li> Like a hot knife thru butter.....</li>
            <li> First I like the plug adapter even though I have to make sure it does not fall out of the plug when you put the razor back in.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe I missed it on the first two passes...</li>
            <li> First let me say the pics posted on this page are not of the shaver that this page is for.   </li>
            <li> Dropped it in the trash on the first day.</li>
            <li> Also good for the environment in that you are reducing your waste by not buying disposable plastic razors or blades.</li>
            <li> There are a few good points.</li>
            <li> I hope you enjoy your new Panasonic ES-SA40-K Pro Curve Wet/Dry Shaver as much as I have.</li>
            <li> I may have to just bite the bullet and cough up the 200 bucks and just get the new Braun knowing that it will cost more and is of lower quality than my old 7526.</li>
            <li> I may have to just bite the bullet and cough up the 200 bucks and just get the new Braun knowing that it will cost more and is of lower quality than my old 7526.</li>
            <li> With this new one, I decided to shave wet--for me, much safer than using a blade and just as smooth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few others over the years, but like my Panasonic single blade the best.</li>
            <li> The low end Braun was good but seemed to frequently miss the neck hairs and soon needed a new foil.  </li>
            <li> The new model has a few cosmetic changes but the same excellent performance.</li>
            <li> Shaves good either wet or dry, light weight</li>
            <li> Excellent product, would recommend to anyone for trimming thick facial or body hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used double edge, straight razors and most electric razors over 40 years.</li>
            <li> I get this item because of high rating and the golden name of Panasonic</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s going strong on the first charge (used daily).</li>
            <li> bought this shaver after reading some positive reviews here on amazon.    </li>
            <li> I bought this as a first cordless shaver for my boyfriend, and he absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> wow what a sweet shaver this do its job</li>
            <li> and in 30+ years of shaving I&#x27;ve never found an electric that shaves as close as the old tried and true blade and water.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic has what I call a direct drive design which cuts clean and fast with no pulling.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I bought this Panasonic and it works like the old Braun.&lt;br /&gt;June</li>
            <li> It does a better job dry shaving me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shaver for a week now (dry shaving) and I love it.</li>
            <li> I use it dry, and I love it.</li>
            <li> I previously used (and still own) the Panasonic ES3041; which judging by the design similarities, was the precursor for the ES-SA40-K.</li>
            <li> It does a good job of shaving, quality is solid and doesn&#x27;t take me long to shave.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Braun single foil shavers for many years and the one I got a year ago</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying it wont work for you, but it certainly didnt worked for me.   </li>
            <li> If it continues to perform this well, it will certainly retain the 5-star rating I gave it.</li>
            <li> This shaver does such a good job dry, I don&#x27;t know why anyone would bother fussing with it in the shower.  </li>
            <li> It works well wet or dry, has a fine trimmer, and it&#x27;s easy to clean.    </li>
            <li> Very reasonably priced for this high quality.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to go and buy a fancy double or triple head razor, this one works just fine.</li>
            <li> This shaver was relatively cheap and can be used wet or dry which is nice.</li>
            <li> The razor is light enough and well contoured enough that I can easily hold it without is falling in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I never normally expected a clean shave</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES-SA40-K Pro shaver will provide a decently close shave for the fraction of the cost when compared to higher end electric shavers.</li>
            <li> Amazing little shaver.</li>
            <li> , this handy little razor will serve you well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is my first electric razor and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am very hapy</li>
            <li> I just hope they don&#x27;t raise the price of this one too much.</li>
            <li> My wife really appreciates that there is no cord for recharging since it frees up the counter space my razor used to take up.</li>
            <li> Really close shave too.   </li>
            <li> One hint, is that you need shave cream or better yet hair conditioner as a skin lubricant if you shave wet.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s important to remember that everyone&#x27;s skin is different, so you know the drill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I really dig this wet/dry Panasonic shaver.  </li>
            <li> I quit using a spray lubricant as it doesn&#x27;t make much difference.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s also the cost, you get what you pay for - but the shaver seems very well designed.    </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I am typically a very picky consumer, but I have never wavered once in my admiration of this razor&#x27;s design   and function.  </li>
            <li> This razor will give one a close smooth shave on every area of a female&#x27;s body.</li>
            <li> It is fast, it shaves well and it doesn&#x27;t cost a whole lot.  </li>
            <li> It was time for a REAL Panasonic.</li>
            <li> It is very well make and durable.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the light weight of this shaver fool you - despite that, it feels solid in your hand</li>
            <li> And if you happen to go a day or two without shaving it, you&#x27;re faced with the whole ordeal all over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I have to agree, for the price of this razor, it performs very well.   </li>
            <li> Also very efective on my son&#x60;s peach fuzz.</li>
            <li> but it looks like it would travel very well,</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Prefer straight razors but they take time and practice.</li>
            <li> My last shaver was a dual blade Panasonic which has a smaller but more useful trimmer that flips out.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this model!  </li>
            <li> The foil is not irritating and fits the contours of my face well.</li>
            <li> I am really liking this razor.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and has the extra trimmer.  </li>
            <li> and I really missed the portability.</li>
            <li> The motor is very underpowered.</li>
            <li> My whiskers grow fast.</li>
            <li> Biggest drawback is it is much louder than the ~$40 shavers.</li>
            <li> Gives a very close shave with some discomfort.</li>
            <li> I should have reposted much sooner</li>
            <li> The shave is probably not as close as you&#x27;d get from some others, but if I want a really close shave</li>
            <li> I guess I would recommend this razor, but don&#x27;t expect a real close shave.  </li>
            <li> He can use it in the shower, on the road, or anywhere he wants.</li>
            <li> Takes longer to shave with only one head but for the price it does shave smooth and a charge lasts just about a week</li>
            <li> he really likes it for the price works</li>
            <li> It cost 3 times as much as this shaver.</li>
            <li> Simple to use and cheap.</li>
            <li> , i really like the wet/dry feature.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After an overnight charge, the battery still lasts a month or so with light daily use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> Well not so fast.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my son who wants a thicker beard, have at it</li>
            <li> but now they offshore much of their work</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t really do the job.</li>
            <li> I think most people are dissapointed because they expect a $30 shaver to give them a shave normally expected from one well over $100.</li>
            <li> All I could find in Local stores was brands I had tried before and did not really have good experiences with.  </li>
            <li> this panasonic is surprisingly quiet, and works well, although i have to run it over my face more times than the old remington.  </li>
            <li> It works best as a wet razor provided that you don&#x27;t use thick shaving cream, rather preapply a skin lotion,</li>
            <li> Easy High 4 stars, even a low 5th star.</li>
            <li> There are things I like better about it compared to other shavers (does well around the neck and is easy to clean), but in general 10 minutes is wayyy to long.  </li>
            <li> Tried it wet shaving at first, but it cut me to the point of bleeding too easily.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous but after it gave me tht smooth shave, it felt really clean.</li>
            <li> transformer/charger needs more space than other razors</li>
            <li> Wall transformer/charger needs more space than other razors   Not as close as a blade.</li>
            <li> Only used a few times, but very painless/easy shave, and nice being cordless!</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s more, phone \\&quot;support\\&quot; is an endless loop of aggravating nonsense.</li>
            <li> Got it for my boyfriend who needs to have a clean shave daily.</li>
            <li> This razor does not provide a clean shave and he has to go over the same spot</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give this particular unit four stars because it gets the job done and was under $100.00 dollars so it was very afordable with wet/dry use.</li>
            <li> The only minor glitch was that the first time I popped off the top to clean it, one of the buttons that holds it on, jammed and the top wouldn&#x27;t go back on.  </li>
            <li> Clean, close, inexpensive, and seems to last forever.</li>
            <li> After reading the multitudes of reviews, some which included phrases such as \\&quot;close and comfortable shave every-time\\&quot; and \\&quot;just as close as a razor\\&quot; etc... I was expecting a little more from the ES-SA40.</li>
            <li> Wow, this thing really works!  </li>
            <li> This time I decided to do some research prior to purchase and the Panasonic came out on top with the most features for the least amount of money.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also pretty loud, louder than my trimmer I use for my goatee.</li>
            <li> I need to find a new screen!</li>
            <li> bulky looking shavers were all that I found and hardly any of them had the pop up trimmer which is great for grooming longer hair prior to shaving.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable and by the time you wear it out, you can either purchase replacement blade and foil or just buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> At Amazon, I got a new foil and blade for a very nominal price.    </li>
            <li> It performs as well as or better than my previous linear shaver from Panasonic at about 1/2 of the price.     </li>
            <li> I do admit that there is a slight burn like any close shave and if this is bothersome a lotion aftershave may be worthwhile.    </li>
            <li> I used the previous model of this shaver for many years until the battery would no longer hold a charge.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the price throw you - this one works better than my triple header ever did, for a lot less money.</li>
            <li> (I use Eucerin Smooth Repair Dry Skin lotion.)</li>
            <li> Personally I&#x27;d rather have it to use than most shavers multiple times the cost.   </li>
            <li> If used for double duty or strictly as a facial shaver, I am confident in recommending this shaver.</li>
            <li> Really love this product and unfortunately they don&#x27;t make them any more.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine what the more expensive Panasonics can offer to be better than this shaver.  </li>
            <li> holds a charge for a decent amount of time.  </li>
            <li> cant beat it for what it does, simple quick shave.</li>
            <li> I found the first time shaving that I needed to shave using the sideburn trimmer first for my entire neck</li>
            <li> Decent shaver from what I can tell, nothing fancy at all.  </li>
            <li> It does an adequate job on short stubble.  </li>
            <li> No, seriously.</li>
            <li> I had a much older model of this shaver and it lasted for over a decade.</li>
            <li> Whether this one in particular deserves 4 stars, I have no idea.</li>
            <li> Along with the single foil design, this allows for very precise shaving - that&#x27;s a key for me, since I have a very angular face.</li>
            <li> The quality of the razor is high grade:  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> My expectations weren&#x27;t high replacing a high end Panasonic that lasted 10 years.</li>
            <li> Bought this razor for my sons who are in High School.  </li>
            <li> It can be cleaned in 30 seconds with a tiny bit of soap and hot water, recharges on a base station quickly, and has an edging slide up blade perfect for finishing touches.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping for a little better.</li>
            <li> also i love the little trimmer thing.</li>
            <li> I get skin irritation, bleed and never gave close shaving leaving complete areas of hair !!</li>
            <li> You have to push hard in order to get a clean shave, but its good enough for a daily trim.</li>
            <li> I suppose a charge level indicator would be nice, but that&#x27;s a feature I&#x27;ve only seen on much more expensive razors.</li>
            <li> The form factor and design we cheap (as expected)</li>
            <li> I got this razor for Christmas, charged it, turned it on and was so happy about the reduction in noise level it could have produced a lousy shave</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d had such good luck with Panasonic in the past that I decided to stick with that brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased at least five of these shavers for our own use and for gifts.  </li>
            <li> The shaver itself performed OK, but less well than my 2 year old 1-series Braun (which had a working trimmer, btw)</li>
            <li> I never had a problem with it catching skin, but every time I use it there are a half dozen to a dozen hairs left</li>
            <li> Luckily, I have a light beard and this shaver seems to do the trick!  (been using for approximately one month)  </li>
            <li> This shaver gives as good a shave as other more expensive wet/dry Panasonics I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> right to left (so basically 4 shaves).  </li>
            <li> This simple shaver works well, especially so wet,  better than my much more expensive, arguably technically superior dry-shave only Braun.   </li>
            <li> :  This razor charges by being snapped directly into a wall transformer, so if your bathroom plug is not oriented with one plug under another or is in a tight spot, you may not be able to use this razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This razor charges by being snapped directly into a wall transformer, so if your bathroom plug is not oriented with one plug under another or is in a tight spot, you may not be able to use this razor.    </li>
            <li> It is too new to determine durability.</li>
            <li> so I decided to buy something new.  </li>
            <li> and it is still working like new.</li>
            <li> still running like new.</li>
            <li> BUT I&#x27;m new to electric shavers and this may be a norm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my new one for over 3 weeks</li>
            <li> Just buy a new shaver every 2-3 years.</li>
            <li> live in China, and I cannot find an electric razor of this quality at this price in my city.</li>
            <li> I live in the US.</li>
            <li> Even brand new with fresh blades it had a hard time giving me the not-so-close shave my cheap Braun gave me.   </li>
            <li> Being able to rinse the razor instead of the expensive cartridge cleaning system that My Braun uses is a HUGE plus.</li>
            <li> You then have to clean it carefully to recover function.</li>
            <li> I liked the close shave of a traditional shave and previous electric shavers would irritate and burn my sensitive skin and pull at my beard.   </li>
            <li> Not quite as smooth as the current state of razor blades, but close enough.    </li>
            <li> if you are looking for ALL OUT facial hair shaver/trimmer, spend the few hundred bucks to get a mac daddy kind</li>
            <li> My old shaver finally gave out after several years of fine service.</li>
            <li> Panasonic delivered and great product in the past; and I expect nothing less from this razor--</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> I have nicked myself multiple times (learning curve: my first electric razor).  </li>
            <li> But now the price is $55 for the exact same model.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a relative in a nursing home, but wanted to try it first.</li>
            <li> At first I said this, \\&quot;This is the only electric shaver I have used that I like.  </li>
            <li> It has since dulled slightly, but it works fine.</li>
            <li> I use it daily and needed to charge it once over the first 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> To get an even closer shave this can simply be taken into a hot shower.</li>
            <li> and I have to say - wow!  </li>
            <li> It out performs several of the higher dollar shavers that I have owned.</li>
            <li> Now, I used razors my entire life and this was the first electric razor I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> I had left my first Panasonic shaver at mom&#x27;s house, and began to shave with a disposable twin blade razor--with it, I drew blood twice.  </li>
            <li> Because the ES-Sa40 can be used wet, I knew full well that it has a cordless charge design</li>
            <li> I am down to like 3 or 4 minutes and can&#x27;t believe it is so smooth.</li>
            <li> With that in mind it&#x27;s simpler to just buy a complete new razor.    </li>
            <li> I first searched for a ladies version, ugh, pink, mauve, really gaudy, and</li>
            <li> Firstly, I will state that I am a 26-year-old male with extremely sensitive skin, prone to acne and razor-burn.  </li>
            <li> I have to admit, the first time I tried using shaving cream with this razor I was skeptical - but the results were astounding.</li>
            <li> I had a Panasonic as my next to last razor, and really liked it, couldn&#x27;t replace it at the time (discontinued) and had Braun for 4 or 5 years that eventually slowed down so much new foils and blades didn&#x27;t even help.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic works great for small jobs, it doesn&#x27;t do very well on my neck area because my hair lays down flat.</li>
            <li> I got this razor based on the low price and all the positive reviews, but it just doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me.</li>
            <li> For less than one third the price of my fancier Panasonic shaver, I&#x27;d say this one shaves about 90% (or better) as close.</li>
            <li> i had a 10yr old remington that was decent, but the mesh was deteriorating, and thought i would just buy a new shaver for about the same price as the new mesh.      </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so large it takes up both outlets in a standard bathroom.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I am that hard to please and my beard can&#x27;t be any tougher than most.</li>
            <li> My old Braun system 3 probably gave a slightly better shave, but at 1/5th the price it is hard to beat the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to now have the closest shave I have ever gotten with an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried nearly every multi-blade manual razor out there.  </li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> I had a Panasonic wet/dry shaver that was getting a bit old and noisy</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this razor.</li>
            <li> so it does double duty and performs very well.</li>
            <li> it charges by sitting in a dock that plugs directly into the outlet, so</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin because i have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and it hasn&#x27;t given me any rash so far.</li>
            <li> If you´re looking for a shaver for your sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I was looking for a shaver to replace my old Braun foil shaver.  </li>
            <li> Second, the comfort level and closeness of the shave is outstanding, especially when using wet.</li>
            <li> If you want a really close shave go back to your 5 blade plastic wonders.  </li>
            <li> Not only do you have to be careful about not cutting yourself (which I&#x27;ve done on far too many occasions), but you can spend ten or twenty minutes going over every bit only to find an hour later</li>
            <li> Unlike my old rotary razor, I get a lot of coverage on the razor&#x27;s foil with which to run the razor over my head.  </li>
            <li> The shaver plugs directly into the \\&quot;wall wart\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> This item is a bit noiser than the old model, but performs as well.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the cordless charging feature, allowing it to plug directly into electric receptacle.</li>
            <li> old son and one for me.</li>
            <li> but I really miss the cord when the charge starts pooping out in the middle of a shave.</li>
            <li> If you want an inexpensive shaver that does it&#x27;s job very well, look no further.  </li>
            <li> this shaver cut my 3 day old hairs effortlessly.  </li>
            <li> First one lasted a long time, until the battery stopped recharging.  </li>
            <li> wow.  </li>
            <li> It is too early to give a complete opinion as I have used for about 10 days.</li>
            <li> and so far holds a charge well.  </li>
            <li> this was close to my old shaver.  </li>
            <li> It does not shave as close as my old shaver.</li>
            <li> so this time time around I decided to go for the cheapest one and I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> As mentioned in the title of this review, however, you need to be careful with this powerful device.  </li>
            <li> Its controls are simple and the razor foil gently glides over my head and face and provides an adequate shave for daily maintenance of my head, and for a decent enough facial appearance for the weekends.  </li>
            <li> he loves it, especially as it is a wet /dry shaver, definite benefit is the charger that plugs in the wall, the unit does the job when it comes to the in between shaves for sure.</li>
            <li> Like others have said, it gives a very close shave with a little burn, but I shave right before I take a shower, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  </li>
            <li> My head hair and facial hair is very fine and dry, which probably made it more difficult for this type of razor to lift and cut the hair.  </li>
            <li> I just wash my face and leave it wet, then shave and the results are still far better than I&#x27;ve ever had with any other electric shaver.</li>
            <li> It has never let me down, always runs perfectly, is so easy to hold onto, and will give me a shave that is unsurpassed in comparison to electric razors that are made especially for women.</li>
            <li> Another huge advantage to this thing is that I have had it a month now, and other than the initial overnight charge, I have never charged it once.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be lucky if two hairs get shaved down, and even then the shave on those two hairs will be substandard.</li>
            <li> Unlike my previous razors, this shaver&#x27;s charging adaptor serves as a nice little stand which allows you to complete a charge in eight hours.</li>
            <li> Single head-shaves much better than more expensive double or triple head models.</li>
            <li> For the price, it does about the same thing as my older (deceased) braun 150 series.</li>
            <li> I bought this mainly for travel and occasional use at home.</li>
            <li> I finally started my quest to find a decent alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic ES-SA40-K Pro Curve Wet/Dry Shaver</li>
            <li> So long as I have electricity, the Panasonic wins over the throwaway double blade razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Battery life is decent too, I&#x27;d say you get about solid 8 minutes of maximum RPM&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s funny that one of Panasonic&#x27;s best shavers is the least expensive one!</li>
            <li> It also never gets as clean as other people claim it does or as simply.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend using it wet, I found that with wet hair the sideburn trimmer will clog easily and pinch you or tug at your skin.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a fine little shaver.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, light, and works well.  </li>
            <li> Small, light, portable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would however not expect for it to be the only shaving unit , if you have normal growth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a regular person, no hard hair or anything</li>
            <li> Perhaps my facial hair type is really different (not thick, a little on the light side)</li>
            <li> The second paragraph is my original review and shows my previous endorsement of the product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the new ones and wish I could have these back!</li>
            <li> The operating instructions do indicate that my face needs one month to adjust to this new razor, and I have only been using it for one week.</li>
            <li> The loss of portability and the fact that I needed a new foil and blade, I decided to try this Panasonic ES-SA40-K because the entire shaver cost about the same as a new foil and blade for the Braun.</li>
            <li> I use Scrubbing Bubbles to clean off the shaving cream scum and the shaver looks like it did when it was new.  </li>
            <li> The replacement blades and foils are so expensive that once you figure in shipping, it is usually only a couple dollars more to buy a whole new shaver.</li>
            <li> Oh and by the way, this is dry saving, not into the foamy stuff much.</li>
            <li> I had an old Braun ~ 20 years old that worked well, but finally died.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t recommend this shaver for daily or even occasional use.</li>
            <li> The only strange thing about this shaver is the complete unit costs as much as the replacement foil.  </li>
            <li> This shaver seems to be working very well, but especially in the first few months.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that might be a little odd is the charger, but it stores nice without the cord.</li>
            <li> It is however definitely worth the 25 dollars if you&#x27;re on a tight budget.</li>
            <li> I have used it wet and dry and the result is the same, a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Wet dry shavers are for light water use and in the instructions tell you the proper way to use these with water.</li>
            <li> The built-in beard trimmer is a little unusual in design, but it actually works out very well.</li>
            <li> Generally in the $30.00 range.</li>
            <li> For work, when I know I will have an important meeting late in the day, I can throw this in my briefcase and know I&#x27;m covered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No pink or mauve anywhere.</li>
            <li> After 10 minutes of trying to shave with this thing, and barely shaving any hair off, I gave up and pulled out my razor.</li>
            <li> I shave nearly every day with this (probably 5-10 minutes per shave) and only need one overnight charge per week.</li>
            <li> I spent as much time tweezing as I did shaving.</li>
            <li> but I had to do some work to get all the hair off: going over the hair multiple times, and you will most likely have to use the secondary trimmer to finish up.   </li>
            <li> The simple charger &#x27;brick&#x27; plugs directly into the wall socket with the shaver snaping into the brick...and precludes the need for a recharge cord.  </li>
            <li> No, this thing takes several passes on day old stubble to pick it up.  </li>
            <li> Back to my old Remington</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old Panasonic ES4025 when the battery finally died after 4 years.  </li>
            <li> If you are tired of paying hundreds of dollars for the the latest Braun, give this a try.  </li>
            <li> In a high altitude cooler and dry climate.</li>
            <li> Over the past 20 years, I have used many of the 2 &amp; 3 blade Panasonic shavers, but I keep coming back to the single blade.  </li>
            <li> I can actually tell by the sound, when it is cutting beard and when the area is clean.  </li>
            <li> I like everything about the razor other than not getting a real close shave.  </li>
            <li> Impressed with the smooth shave, and sick of paying for expensive blades for my regular razor,  I decided to buy a rechargeable shaver for myself.</li>
            <li> With each new shaver the cost of the blade and foil assembly replacement seemed to approach the price of a completely new shaver with less features.  </li>
            <li> I sort of expected that it would at least be able to cut hair.</li>
            <li> Takes quite a while to fully charge, but not a big deal since i&#x27;m only using a few minutes at a time to do a quick shave in the morning.</li>
            <li> It provides a decently close shave and you can get it as wet as you like.</li>
            <li> This shaver is LOUD, it sends out a high frequency buzz that is most unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> This gets closer than most, but I still find I need to revert to a manual razor at least one every other week.</li>
            <li> I kept my 7526 alive for as long as I could</li>
            <li> I wish I would have replaced my old one a long time before.</li>
            <li> After trying it a few times in the shower, I can pretty much conclude it doesn&#x27;t work either wet or dry.</li>
            <li> The first one was two years old and the foil finally started getting dull.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long the shaver will last, but the price is low enough that it would not be unreasonable to buy a replacement head or an entirely new shaver multiple times per year.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper than most ladies shavers, slimmer, holds its charge for a long time, has a little plastic snap-on cover to protect the roller, and it&#x27;s black!</li>
            <li> I always have trouble just under my jaw on my neck, can&#x27;t get a clean shave in less that like 6 or 7 minutes.</li>
            <li> (my hair was maybe half an inch long at the longest) and followed up with the regular razor for a reasonably close shave.</li>
            <li> and I go up and down, down and up, left to right,</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be trying any other electric shavers in the near future.</li>
            <li> dont get me wrong, but it just wont shave my neck hair, i can pretty much on use it to shave off facial hair above the chin, not below,</li>
            <li> My only slight disappointment is that it takes longer to do a good job than a razor blade, but that said, if I spend the time it seems to shave as close as the outrageously-priced Power Fusion blade, ONE 8-pack of which currently costs ($27.99)</li>
            <li> This little razor gets a High Rating from me.</li>
            <li> It costs less than a new shaving head for the Norelco.    </li>
            <li> It left most of my slightly longer hairs behind.</li>
            <li> The shaver simply would not cut my hair properly - long strands and clumps would be left in spots</li>
            <li> When the blade set gets older I might use soap from time-to-time if I let my beard go for a few days.</li>
            <li> One of the main complaints was that this product did not provide a close shave and, after using this product for a few weeks, I would have to agree.</li>
            <li> i have only used it dry, not wet or with shaving cream, and it works well dry.    </li>
            <li> In other words the center of gravity of the shaver in the recharger is too high.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 50&#x27;s with a dry tender face, medium hair strength, multiple napp angles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too expensive, withstands wear and tear, is easy on his skin, and does the job well enough for his needs.  </li>
            <li> I have trimmed facial hair so only need to shave neck and around the trimmed areas which is why I like single foils.</li>
            <li> I like it also because it DOESN&#x27;T have the awkward, wobbly head, which is so prevalent in many more expensive razors.</li>
            <li> The charge on it last a long time.</li>
            <li> How long will the foil last?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not owned this long enough to form an opinion on durability.</li>
            <li> if I lay it flat on a counter</li>
            <li> The trimmer on this shaver cut my skin and pulled my hair regarledd of whether the hairs were short or long.</li>
            <li> How long it will last might be another matter as anybody can tell you &#x27;</li>
            <li> It takes a long time with repeatedly shaving the same area over and over until achieving an acceptable shave.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve been using it long enough for it</li>
            <li> If you buy such a product, just be aware that if it fails after the warranty period, you gotta buy a new one.</li>
            <li> but I could find no major flaws.</li>
            <li> Remember people, take care of your tools because they just don&#x27;t last as long as they used to!</li>
            <li> I gave up purchasing their new models a few months ago when they raised their price to over $250 and the replacement foils are $40.  </li>
            <li> Due to recent neck surgery, which left several serious and very tender incisions on the part of my neck which has been typically difficult to shave, I was looking for a safe  electric razor option that would:     </li>
            <li> The battery last a very long time too.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s only 30 bucks.nstead of the expensive cartridge cleaning system that My Braun uses is a HUGE plus.</li>
            <li> Finally, I was visiting my dad and saw the Panasonic Wet/ Dry.  </li>
            <li> I only use it dry.</li>
            <li> This shaver works much better than the other electric shavers I have tried, which include a rotary style shaver and an expensive Braun self cleaning shaver.</li>
            <li> Somehow, the foil only needs to be replaced once a year and the blades only need to be replaced every other year.</li>
            <li> I read other online reviews of this product and I had my reservations, but without a big price increase this was the only electric shaver I could afford that would work in the shower.  </li>
            <li> With other razors, the foils did not last very long and the replacement cost was not that much less than a new shaver.  </li>
            <li> complaint is I wish the sideburn trimmer didn&#x27;t stick straight out the back,&lt;br /&gt;because</li>
            <li> so well, that after a month, I purchased a spare foil and blade, so that I can keep using it past the normal foil life.  </li>
            <li> A minor issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The battery in my old one died years ago and it was fairly heavy</li>
            <li> The question is how long it lasts...</li>
            <li> Charge lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Shaves close but has problems with long whiskers.</li>
            <li> I have not had it long</li>
            <li> Holds a charge a long time and cuts through three-day beards.</li>
            <li> I bought two of them, so long as you can get it when on offer for under $26</li>
            <li> They like it, and it seems to hold a charge for a long time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Charger is a bit strange, but I suppose its a safety thing since its wet/dry.</li>
            <li> I have only used this in a Dry mode and not when wet, but it does NOT shave.  </li>
            <li> Which is double the time of other shavers.  </li>
            <li> And with that, I stopped spending the money on haircuts, replacing them with an endless supply of disposable razors and a Remington Rotary Razor that I got several years ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Admittedly I only use it every other day as I&#x27;m bearded and shave just my neck and lower lip area.</li>
            <li> and it seems to run for a very long time before it needs a charge.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get any rash when I used it dry, which is so convenient when you are in a hurry, not to have to foam up the way we have to with a razor.</li>
            <li> After about 10 shaves or so my skin got use to it to the point that I can shave dry now too.</li>
            <li> If you shave dry, you want it bone dry.  </li>
            <li> Just take the screen off, rinse it and the head in tap water and allow to air dry before assembly.  </li>
            <li> I used it dry.</li>
            <li> dry works</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to stop a few times and turn the unit back on because I inadvertently turned it off, this only happens when I try to pop up the trimmer while I am using the shaver though.</li>
            <li> Wow, I was skeptical, but this baby really works.</li>
            <li> Invest in one of these and you&#x27;ll save so much money, at almost $10 for a packet of razors that last only a few uses, this will pay for itself in only a few months and then you won&#x27;t have to fork out your hard earned cash for disposable razors which end up in the trash.</li>
            <li> This is my 6th panasonic single blade shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried multible head shavers, and prefer the single head model.</li>
            <li> The limited warranty allows you to exchange defective rechargeable batteries within two years.</li>
            <li> I use it every single day, sometimes twice a day.  </li>
            <li> I purchase the least expensive shavers because they generally cost about the same or a little more than a replacement foil.</li>
            <li> It has trouble with the neck curvatures and if you are not careful you will get skin burns.</li>
            <li> The foil is not particularly wide, but that&#x27;s not a huge detractor, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> to.&lt;br /&gt;It is irritating to use at first (for both mind and skin)</li>
            <li> Very quick cutting , I use it dry</li>
            <li> The only down side is that the trimmer doesn&#x27;t stick out, it just slides up, which makes it tougher to get it where you want it.</li>
            <li> The motor doesn&#x27;t seem to wind down in power even after multiple uses without recharging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like I read on someone elses review, you can hear it cutting the hairs, it is so cool!</li>
            <li> Works well wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Tried this product wet &amp; dry, does not work on the neck or under chin.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s wet dry.  </li>
            <li> As an added bonus, it works well wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m on a serious budget, I looked for one that had decent reviews.  </li>
            <li> This is the 3rd one and, even though the shape/style and model number has changed slightly over the years, it&#x27;s still the same basic single-blade wet/dry shaver I&#x27;ve used for the past 11 years.  </li>
            <li> Actually (and oddly), using shaving cream with it severely irritated my face (like in welts).  </li>
            <li> My last purchase prior to this one was an inexpensive Braun that was an impulse buy after I was fed up with buying the expensive liquid cleaning agent for my high end Braun model.  </li>
            <li> The shaver&#x27;s power was weak off battery and the cord it was attached to was not long enough or tight enough to enable me to shave without essentially hugging a wall.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;wet\\&quot; mode was a little disappointing, as it irritated my face more than the dry mode...</li>
            <li> I saw several reviews mentioned that it grabbed skin, so I was a little concerned when I bought it.  </li>
            <li> I did not want to risk spending a lot on an unknown razor, so i tried it.    </li>
            <li> I saw you could use shave cream for protection and shave wet in the shower.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been shaving \\&quot;regularly\\&quot; for roughly 5 years.  </li>
            <li> My recommendation to maximize performance for it is to use it as a wet shaver, applying shaving cream just like you would with a blade.  </li>
            <li> I only have to charge it once every few weeks</li>
            <li> I had hoped the wet aspect would provide a closer shave.</li>
            <li> What I have found is that without keeping a lubricant in place, this razor pulls on wet skin.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, the wet capability means it cleans well after use.</li>
            <li> a charge for several days.&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper than a few months of razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;Wall</li>
            <li> so each morning it is not ready to shave with an electric razor-until now.</li>
            <li> Not as the close shave as I expected out of it.</li>
            <li> This thing is an utter waste of money.</li>
            <li> and I have used it everyday with the same charge it came with.</li>
            <li> works if you are careful</li>
            <li> and I did not use it wet or with gel as some have recommended.       </li>
            <li> I like a shaver I can use wet, and this is the cheapest one I can find.</li>
            <li> My beard is not real course or rough, so I can&#x27;t say how this shaver would do for guys with tougher beards...</li>
            <li> The shaver is what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> Never used it &#x27;wet&#x27; but</li>
            <li> The wet shave option might be a bonus to anyone who wanted to shave in the shower or use a shave cream.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is so-so performance, but that&#x27;s of minimal importance to me.  </li>
            <li> you use it wet</li>
            <li> should last them a few years</li>
            <li> A small brush is included and cleaning is simple under running water or dry    </li>
            <li> I have pretty thick growth, and this left behind longer hairs.</li>
            <li> I used the previous Panasonic dry,</li>
            <li> Previously I have owned Norelco razors with three flexing heads, but I like the ES-SA40-K&#x27;s floating head with a single blade.</li>
            <li> But at the end of the day, it becomes frustrating to replace the blades so often, which is highly recommended for closest results and</li>
            <li> I was hoping that an electric shaver would save time, be more convenient, and be less painful.</li>
            <li> I think this is due to the screen vs rotary heads.  </li>
            <li> Also, please note (as one other low-score reviewer did) that horizontally mounted outlets are out of the question - the shaver cannot be charged if the wall wart is plugged into a horizontal outlet.  </li>
            <li> A cheap razor is criminally expensive if it does not work--it wastes your time, and if you buy it from a store like I did, it wastes two trips of gas.</li>
            <li> I bought this item, really not expecting for it to be anything other than average.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t experience any \\&quot;burn\\&quot; or other discomfort.</li>
            <li> used every other day&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> I have two and recharge one while using the other.</li>
            <li> Found this one and just used it the other day......</li>
            <li> I bought this to use in the shower for my face and other trimming as needed.  </li>
            <li> Stop buying expensive blades for your old razor, it&#x27;s a total scam.</li>
            <li> Every few days, though, I have to run it under water and let it air dry before using it again.</li>
            <li> bought this is a attempt to save on the cost of razor blades but does such a poor job I am back to using razors.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;side trimmer\\&quot; didn&#x27;t engage when partially extended to facilitate shaving under the chin as my previous shavers did.  </li>
            <li> While it does require a few passes in various directions, the end result is comparable to a razor (and less the mess and cleanup).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a small thing, that it might just be me being clumsy, but it might be something that the designers keep in mind for future iterations of this shaver.     </li>
            <li> The only thing worse than enduring the noise from this is that I have leave the thing turned on for a long time to perform even minimal grooming.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is the AC adapter/charger blocks my other wall plug.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t press too hard when you use this, unlike the pressure needed with a regular razor, this shaver will do the work for you, this will avoid the  &#x27;bumps&#x27; that some reviewers have said they got when using this shaver.</li>
            <li> Shaver is not worth $ 10 they do not cut the hair</li>
            <li> The shave is quite average.</li>
            <li> I have wanted to get an electric shaver since I am pretty lazy and hate using a straight edge.</li>
            <li> My last previous Panasonic needed to be replaced due to battery failure.</li>
            <li> But using the pop-up trimmer cuts them all down to size</li>
            <li> I doubt I&#x27;ll be let down.     </li>
            <li> No, my razor never let me down there.  </li>
            <li> , I like the closeness of the shave, and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t bog down even if I blow off shaving all weekend.</li>
            <li> With lubricant, it does no better than it does as dry.</li>
            <li> use it dry, usually after a shower, works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> less irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought the rate of inflation was supposed to be less than 2%.</li>
            <li> It cuts the time I&#x27;m shaving in half.</li>
            <li> And this is based on only using it dry whereas I always use my expensive Panasonic wet.</li>
            <li> it cost less than $30, considering the quality.</li>
            <li> I typically get two years out of the blade set.</li>
            <li> I have a \\&quot;day and a half beard\\&quot;</li>
            <li> They have typically have a life span</li>
            <li> I have been using this model for about 10 years, and typically get 1.5 to 2 years out of each.</li>
            <li> I purchased the ES-SA40-K based off of my experiences with my previous Panasonic shaver, and the price-point.    </li>
            <li> (probably the biggest selling point aside from my previous experience)  </li>
            <li> Pro Curve Wet/Dry Shaver, Black]].</li>
            <li> I bought it on a whim because I got it for about half price and figured what the heck, maybe it would be neat to shave in the shower.</li>
            <li> I had a couple Brauns previously.</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t have a 5 oclock shadow, I had 5 oclock black out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a super close shave, but it does the job, and the battery lasts me at least a few weeks with daily shaves.  </li>
            <li> I usually use the razor wet.</li>
            <li> I bought this shave because I´ve very sensitive skin and blades were cutting my face every single day.</li>
            <li> Long charge time (8 hours)  Essentially disposable since repairing and replacing blade/foil is expensive.    </li>
            <li> Is a little noisy (that&#x27;s why 4 star)</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve got a little island of hairs on one corner of your head that you&#x27;re convinced everyone spots immediately.  </li>
            <li> Even the instructional manual states that it takes a little while getting used to a micro-screen.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it costs too much to replace the cutting head and foil, so I just buy a new one.</li>
            <li> I failed to notice that this shaver does not have dual voltage unlike my previous Norelco shaver which was roughly the same price.</li>
            <li> but I will use this when necessary until it breaks while I search for a quieter shaver that works in the shower and can actually trim without cutting.  </li>
            <li> Money wasted.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> well on the scalp&lt;br /&gt;Great for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;Holds</li>
            <li> Cheaper than a few months of razor blades.    </li>
            <li> I knew I was being a cheapskate when I got this, but somehow I thought I could trust a brand like Panasonic to at least give me a rough shave.</li>
            <li> A few tweezed hairs is always acceptable when using electric razors.</li>
            <li> There have been a few times when the shaver has burned my face as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver because I was tired of having to buy replacement razor-blades that cost a third of this shaver.</li>
            <li> This was the least expensive shaver I saw, so I picked it up not expecting much.  </li>
            <li> So shaving is not a huge ordeal.  </li>
            <li> Other reviewers have complained about how the recharger cradle for this shaver sits vertically in the power outlet</li>
            <li> After several years of reliable service, my previous unit failed permanently.</li>
            <li> Amazon, as usual, sent the shaver promptly and well-protected from the elements.</li>
            <li> if you are looking to spend $30 and get a mediocre trimmer that does its job, above the chin line, this is for you,.</li>
            <li> Look no more.</li>
            <li> Usually you have to wait weeks for your face to get used to an electric razor, it didnt matter.    </li>
            <li> There is no more than 1\\&quot; of clearance between the shaver and the wall when it is plugged into its charging system.</li>
            <li> I have 4 outlets, and 4 medicine cabinets, and am unable to plug in this shaver in any bathroom outlet in my entire house.  </li>
            <li> had a relatively ancient three head Remington razor that was relatively useless.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work worth crap on the face though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves random hairs everywhere especially if your hair is longer than a day or two of stubble.</li>
            <li> In terms of use and performance, the ES-SA40-K shaves every bit as well, if not better, IMO.  </li>
            <li> This electric razor, using it everyday, would take me at least 20 minutes to get a semi-close shave.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s made in Japan still</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to figure out a way to put a small extension cord on it and get it off the wall.  </li>
            <li> Usually I have to use the trimmer after I fully shave as it always leaves areas with hair.</li>
            <li> I find that it often tugs on my facial hair which is quite uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Does the same job as the expensive shavers.</li>
            <li> Second, my beard is very thick and tough</li>
            <li> I came back to do this review after I bought a different 2-head Panasonic razor which turned out to be very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Only negative is that the trimmer head design makes precision trims difficult.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The truth is that using a regular razor on my head is slow and tedious.  </li>
            <li> From all the other reviews I thought this would help me save some time everyday, but boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Braun recently changed their foil design, and the new foil is just terrible.  </li>
            <li> would give sufficient control in an area that was very numb and very tender     4.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still finding it hard to believe  </li>
            <li> and then the blade goes dull</li>
            <li> I imagine the skin grabbers probably pushed hard to try to get these errant hairs.  </li>
            <li> but I might have been trying too hard to get the neck</li>
            <li> I could hardly find any any hair to remove using the razor afterwards.</li>
            <li> Hard to get a close, even shave and if I did get a close shave it took at least 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> If I am running late for work, I just slip it in my pocket at go.</li>
            <li> At least I&#x27;m not out allot of money.</li>
            <li> At least I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> done(this is where it works the least).  </li>
            <li> I like shaving in the shower with it because it gives my thick beard a closer shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Beard trimmer cuts slow and hurts when you speed</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a light-bearded gent looking for a change or simply an alternative to expensive cartridges, give this highly-economical shaver a try!</li>
            <li> It failed due to moisture in the circuitry.  </li>
            <li> As indicated in some other reviews, longer hairs are difficult to cut, but this model contains a slide up full-width trimmer which can be used to groom moustaches and sideburns.</li>
            <li> If you wait and use it when hair has grown out it will hardly have any affect at all in cutting long hairs..</li>
            <li> Worse, there was residue all over the shaving head, very messy.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I decided to try the less expensive ES-SA40-K shaver</li>
            <li> SERIOUSLY.</li>
            <li> But this was ridiculous.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Some discomfort\\&quot; soon escalates into serious discomfort and abrasion.</li>
            <li> The single blade models I have had over the years start with a battery life of approximately 1 month between charges!!</li>
            <li> Most annoying is the charging base.</li>
            <li> I have had a number of expensive Braun shavers in the past 20 years.  </li>
            <li> First use produced some nasty razor burns on my neck,</li>
            <li> Note that the charger for this shaver is incompatible with outlets with horizontal slots, a very common arrangement here in the Chicago area.</li>
            <li> This gives you approximately 20 minutes of cordless shaving time.</li>
            <li> These items cost approximately $10 each.</li>
            <li> Well in my situation, the problem is even worse.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, my main question is: Why would Panasonic release something as horrible as this?</li>
            <li> This is not to say that I am disappointed with the product but that it does not work as well as I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the expensive Braun electrics since I was a teenager.  </li>
            <li> They do not get any of the stubble on their necks, totally useless.  </li>
            <li> I was wrong on all three accounts.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they no longer make this shaver anymore.</li>
            <li> I don&#x60;t think any one would go wrong with this razor.</li>
            <li> For the closest smoothest shave you cannot go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the shaver no longer holds a charge so I am unable to use it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately there is no corded option</li>
            <li> In my opinion, results are comparable to expensive floating-head models at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Panasonic Electric Razor because I was desperate.  </li>
            <li> Instead of cutting hair, the shaver feels like it pulls your hair out.</li>
            <li> not create a cutting possibility of the incision areas     3.</li>
            <li> the vendor is crazy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so bad that I would change my rating to a 4.  </li>
            <li> and the result is often bad.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Stupid, stupid, stupid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve overcome this by using an extension cord, but it is annoying.</li>
            <li> Both my son and husband are very disappointed in them.  </li>

            <li> This is a very useful shaver for most men.  I bought this for my son and he keeps it plugged up in the bathroom for handy use.</li>
            <li> thank you Amazon for such great quality products. this machine was recomended to me by my barber, and it works great.</li>
            <li> Very nice shaver. Gives close shaves and does not chafe the skin. Lasts one week on a charge. Wet/dry feature is great. Very good price.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES-SA40-K Pro Curve Wet/Dry Shaver, is the best simple single blade shaver that I have used.  I shave in the shower and have used many of the Panasonic wet/dry shavers.  The Panasonic ES-SA40-K Pro Curve Wet/Dry Shaver single blade gives me the best shave for the cost.  Over the past 20 years, I have used many of the 2 &amp; 3 blade Panasonic shavers, but I keep coming back to the single blade.  None of them give you the best shave around the neck, but the Panasonic ES-SA40-K Pro Curve Wet/Dry Shaver, single blade has done the best of all of them.  The price is reasonable and by the time you wear it out, you can either purchase replacement blade and foil or just buy a new one.  I use Scrubbing Bubbles to clean off the shaving cream scum and the shaver looks like it did when it was new.  I hope you enjoy your new Panasonic ES-SA40-K Pro Curve Wet/Dry Shaver as much as I have.</li>
            <li> This is the best one I have ever used. You don&#x27;t need to go and buy a fancy double or triple head razor, this one works just fine. The charge on it last a long time. I have not charged mine up in 2 weeks and it is still running strong. It shaves really close and it glides very smooth across my face. If I am running late for work, I just slip it in my pocket at go. This little razor gets a High Rating from me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Panasonic Electric Razor because I was desperate.  All I could find in Local stores was brands I had tried before and did not really have good experiences with.  I did not want to risk spending a lot on an unknown razor, so i tried it.    Wow!  This is the BEST electric Razor I have ever used.  It gives me a clean shave without a lot of effort.  I can actually tell by the sound, when it is cutting beard and when the area is clean.  This is the closest I have ever gotten to a regular blade shaver with electric.    I like it so well, that after a month, I purchased a spare foil and blade, so that I can keep using it past the normal foil life.  That part I do not know about yet.  How long will the foil last?  With other razors, the foils did not last very long and the replacement cost was not that much less than a new shaver.  At Amazon, I got a new foil and blade for a very nominal price.    I am very hapy I gave the Panasonic a try.    Ted Misich</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the expensive Braun electrics since I was a teenager.  I gave up purchasing their new models a few months ago when they raised their price to over $250 and the replacement foils are $40.  This was the least expensive shaver I saw, so I picked it up not expecting much.  Wow, this thing really works!  Like others have said, it gives a very close shave with a little burn, but I shave right before I take a shower, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  I&#x27;m really impressed with the pop-up trimmer.  It&#x27;s the best trimmer I have ever had.  My hair grows close to my skin, so after a day or two of not shaving, any electric shaver won&#x27;t get the longer hairs that are close to my skin.  But using the pop-up trimmer cuts them all down to size and then they are easy to shave.    I bought mine from Fry&#x27;s.  The only strange thing about this shaver is the complete unit costs as much as the replacement foil.  So when I dropped it in the sink and bent the foil, I just bought another shaver for $19.99 and not the replacement block and foil for $20.    If you are tired of paying hundreds of dollars for the the latest Braun, give this a try.  I just hope they don&#x27;t raise the price of this one too much.</li>
            <li> My husband had one of these shavers and I would use it on occasion when I ran out of razors. Impressed with the smooth shave, and sick of paying for expensive blades for my regular razor,  I decided to buy a rechargeable shaver for myself. I first searched for a ladies version, ugh, pink, mauve, really gaudy, and bulky looking shavers were all that I found and hardly any of them had the pop up trimmer which is great for grooming longer hair prior to shaving. So, I searched for a mens shaver and found this one.     This shaver arrived already charged, and that charge lasted for weeks. The smooth slim design allows for ease of use on curved areas, underarms, knees etc. Don&#x27;t press too hard when you use this, unlike the pressure needed with a regular razor, this shaver will do the work for you, this will avoid the  &#x27;bumps&#x27; that some reviewers have said they got when using this shaver. I have used it wet and dry and the result is the same, a smooth shave. I didn&#x27;t get any rash when I used it dry, which is so convenient when you are in a hurry, not to have to foam up the way we have to with a razor. The only design flaw that I see is that while the shaver is on, by the way I have to grip the shaver, it tends to force me to push the power button into the off position when I am popping the trimmer up. Either this is just a &#x27;me&#x27; thing, maybe some people stop shaving turn the unit over, use both hands and then pop the trimmer up, but I like to be able to do it seamlessly. I&#x27;ve had to stop a few times and turn the unit back on because I inadvertently turned it off, this only happens when I try to pop up the trimmer while I am using the shaver though. It&#x27;s such a small thing, that it might just be me being clumsy, but it might be something that the designers keep in mind for future iterations of this shaver.     I would definitely recommend this shaver to any female shoppers out there. It&#x27;s cheaper than most ladies shavers, slimmer, holds its charge for a long time, has a little plastic snap-on cover to protect the roller, and it&#x27;s black! No pink or mauve anywhere. Definitely worth the price, and the performance is excellent.   Stop buying expensive blades for your old razor, it&#x27;s a total scam. Invest in one of these and you&#x27;ll save so much money, at almost $10 for a packet of razors that last only a few uses, this will pay for itself in only a few months and then you won&#x27;t have to fork out your hard earned cash for disposable razors which end up in the trash. Also good for the environment in that you are reducing your waste by not buying disposable plastic razors or blades.</li>
            <li> I have had a number of expensive Braun shavers in the past 20 years.  With each new shaver the cost of the blade and foil assembly replacement seemed to approach the price of a completely new shaver with less features.  My last purchase prior to this one was an inexpensive Braun that was an impulse buy after I was fed up with buying the expensive liquid cleaning agent for my high end Braun model.  The low end Braun was good but seemed to frequently miss the neck hairs and soon needed a new foil.  This time I decided to do some research prior to purchase and the Panasonic came out on top with the most features for the least amount of money.  I was pleasantly surprised to now have the closest shave I have ever gotten with an electric razor.  I am thrilled that I can use shaving cream to soften my beard and the cleanup under the faucet is quick and easy.  Now I always have a perfectly clean razor that looks like new.  My wife really appreciates that there is no cord for recharging since it frees up the counter space my razor used to take up.</li>
            <li> My dad&#x27;s been telling me to use an electric razor for years, because I get a lot of ingrown hairs / razor bumps from using a Mach 3 razor.  I liked the close shave of a traditional shave and previous electric shavers would irritate and burn my sensitive skin and pull at my beard.   Finally, I was visiting my dad and saw the Panasonic Wet/ Dry.  I saw you could use shave cream for protection and shave wet in the shower. I gave it a try and it was great. I took it easy and didn&#x27;t get much irritation. Really close shave too.   I went ahead and bought one and rarely get ingrown hairs.     After about 10 shaves or so my skin got use to it to the point that I can shave dry now too. One hint, is that you need shave cream or better yet hair conditioner as a skin lubricant if you shave wet. If you shave dry, you want it bone dry.  I bought one for my brother and now he&#x27;s loving it too.  He&#x27;s more happy with the money he saves on all of those expensive Mach 3 Turbo replacement blades.</li>
            <li> Firstly, I will state that I am a 26-year-old male with extremely sensitive skin, prone to acne and razor-burn.  Luckily, I have a light beard and this shaver seems to do the trick!  (been using for approximately one month)  Also, it&#x27;s important to remember that everyone&#x27;s skin is different, so you know the drill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been shaving \\&quot;regularly\\&quot; for roughly 5 years.  Heaviest growth in mustache, then chin, and neck/side of face are lightest.  I&#x27;ve tried nearly every multi-blade manual razor out there.  Some better than others.  But at the end of the day, it becomes frustrating to replace the blades so often, which is highly recommended for closest results and less irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a nutshell, I really dig this wet/dry Panasonic shaver.  For some puzzling reason, this electric shaver works better around my mustache and chin than a blade.  Granted, thats with multiples passes but still noteworthy.  As mentioned in the title of this review, however, you need to be careful with this powerful device.  I have nicked myself multiple times (learning curve: my first electric razor).  My recommendation to maximize performance for it is to use it as a wet shaver, applying shaving cream just like you would with a blade.  This way, you have lubrication and are cleaning it in the process.  Obviously, the neck area can be tricky, but contorting your face etc. can aid you in the process.  There&#x27;s tons of great shaving videos out there on the Web.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the durability/longevity will play a factor in my overall satisfaction.  I am hopeful it will last me a while.  If you&#x27;re a light-bearded gent looking for a change or simply an alternative to expensive cartridges, give this highly-economical shaver a try!</li>
            <li> It shaves much faster than an older two foil shaver, is much more comfortable, shaves just as close and is not as noisy. The pop-up trim is easy to use.  The wet/dry feature is especially nice for cleaning.  Just take the screen off, rinse it and the head in tap water and allow to air dry before assembly.  I quit using a spray lubricant as it doesn&#x27;t make much difference.  The sale price wasn&#x27;t much more than a new cutter/screen set, so I just bought another shaver for myself and one for a son.  It is too new to determine durability.</li>
            <li> You can tell in the first 20 seconds, this is a shaver of your dreams.  So close, it&#x27;s mystical.  Wow. I&#x27;m impressed.  The guys who engineered this?  Freaking Wow.  Congrats, dudes.  And an incredible price.  1/7th the price of the others.</li>
            <li> This shaver does a nice job, but it takes me 10 minutes!  Which is double the time of other shavers.  There are things I like better about it compared to other shavers (does well around the neck and is easy to clean), but in general 10 minutes is wayyy to long.  May need to get another shaver.</li>
            <li> Great product. Really enjoy how it feels and works. Love that it&#x27;s water proof. All around an awesome razor especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I actually use this to shave my head--works great.  Feels well made, it&#x27;s inexpensive, I like the wet/dry feature.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a great shaver for the price. Personally I&#x27;d rather have it to use than most shavers multiple times the cost.   Is simple works well, light, very easy to use and charge. I only have to charge it once every few weeks it seems.   However, be warned you must use it every day for it to work. If you wait and use it when hair has grown out it will hardly have any affect at all in cutting long hairs..</li>
            <li> I bought two of these electric razors.   For Christmas gifts.  Both my son and husband are very disappointed in them.  They do not get any of the stubble on their necks, totally useless.  Ok on the face for my husband,  but my son has sensitive skin and it chews up his face too.     Money wasted.</li>
            <li> This shaver works much better than the other electric shavers I have tried, which include a rotary style shaver and an expensive Braun self cleaning shaver. I don&#x27;t know how long the shaver will last, but the price is low enough that it would not be unreasonable to buy a replacement head or an entirely new shaver multiple times per year.</li>
            <li> I had a Panasonic wet/dry shaver that was getting a bit old and noisy so I decided to buy something new.  There were shavers on sale at Macys and I used Amazon for research.  Was impressed with the reviews I saw on Amazon and bought this one online instead.  It was no mistake!  It is quieter and provides better shave quality than the older one (ES8077 wet/dry linear model) at a fraction of the price.  Has to be the best buy if you decide to go the electric route.  The one potential disadvantage is lack of a cord for recharging but that is not a factor for me.</li>
            <li> this shaver does not work very good.  my daughter tried it and reorted the same experience</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this razor. It does fairly well without preshave or shaving cream. I use it in the shower which makes it easy to rinse clean. Although not as close as a razor shave, I feel it does an acceptable job.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ES-SA40 is the third Panasonic shaver that I have owned. After several years of reliable service, my previous unit failed permanently. I replaced that unit with this one and continue to be impressed by my Panasonic purchases.    This unit is a tremendous value for the purchase price. It performs as well as or better than my previous linear shaver from Panasonic at about 1/2 of the price.     I use this unit to shave my face and head so it does double duty and performs very well. If used for double duty or strictly as a facial shaver, I am confident in recommending this shaver.</li>
            <li> I use the ES-SA40-K to shave both my beard and head. Overall, I am happy with the product. Not quite as smooth as the current state of razor blades, but close enough.    I had hoped the wet aspect would provide a closer shave. What I have found is that without keeping a lubricant in place, this razor pulls on wet skin. With lubricant, it does no better than it does as dry. On the plus side, the wet capability means it cleans well after use. I am saving money by not longer shaving in a hot shower. :-)</li>
            <li> My old shaver finally gave out after several years of fine service. I&#x27;d had such good luck with Panasonic in the past that I decided to stick with that brand. I chose the ES-SA40-K because it had a fine price and excellent reviews.    Amazon, as usual, sent the shaver promptly and well-protected from the elements. I was pleased with the very first shave - comfortable, and very close . . . and every shave, thereafter, has been just as good. It works well wet or dry, has a fine trimmer, and it&#x27;s easy to clean.    A great purchase in every respect!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on the basis of good reviews here and that I had never tried a Wet/Dry shaver before.  This is also the first time I used a non-rotary electric shaver.    The shaver simply would not cut my hair properly - long strands and clumps would be left in spots no matter how many times I went over them.  I think this is due to the screen vs rotary heads.  It simply does not do as well.  It may have worked slightly better lathered up in the shower as a wet shaver, but still not great.  Maybe it&#x27;s also the cost, you get what you pay for - but the shaver seems very well designed.    Caveat:  My head hair and facial hair is very fine and dry, which probably made it more difficult for this type of razor to lift and cut the hair.  I know guys that have the thicker hair that can actually grow a beard, and it probably would work well for them.</li>
            <li> Light weight, powerful, reasonably priced, well designed charger, shaves heavy growth well, no skin irritation, very easy to clean with 409 spray cleaner and water.  Only negative is that the trimmer head design makes precision trims difficult. A minor issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very satisfied with this shaver and plan to buy a spare in case this model is discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oct 2012 update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did buy a second shaver in June 2011.  At that time the price was $30.  But now the price is $55 for the exact same model. I thought the rate of inflation was supposed to be less than 2%. What happened?</li>
            <li> Really love this product and unfortunately they don&#x27;t make them any more.  Don&#x27;t like the new ones and wish I could have these back!</li>
            <li> Have not used this shaver on the \\&quot;wet\\&quot; side.  As a dry shaver, I miss a lot of those curly rascals and eventually have to use a razor if I want a really good shave.</li>
            <li> This holds a charge well.  It works as well or better than any electrical shaver I&#x27;ve owned. It cuts the time I&#x27;m shaving in half. Works well wet or dry. I&#x27;ve not owned this long enough to form an opinion on durability. Easy High 4 stars, even a low 5th star. I&#x27;m all too pleased.</li>
            <li> This gives the closest shaves I have had in 40 years of electric razors.  The single head is more than adequate.  This is the first wet/dry razor I have owned.  I won&#x27;t go back.</li>
            <li> I bought this electric shaver because I was out of replacement cartridges for my Gillette. I was hoping that an electric shaver would save time, be more convenient, and be less painful. I was wrong on all three accounts. Instead of cutting hair, the shaver feels like it pulls your hair out. It saved me no time because it didn&#x27;t work. After 10 minutes of trying to shave with this thing, and barely shaving any hair off, I gave up and pulled out my razor. Do not buy this product. I won&#x27;t be trying any other electric shavers in the near future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always bought the \\&quot;basic\\&quot; Panasonic shaver as it always gave a good shave, was very inexpensive and like most shavers disposable as the battery cannot be replaced.  Initially the shaver worked flawlessly but 3 months later the power simply fizzes out even though I keep it charged.  Made in China, no quality control, what do you expect?</li>
            <li> I have been a Norelco user for many years but never seem to get a really close shave even after many passes. When going somewhere I have to use a blade shaver especially on my neck.    I decided to again try a screen shaver and after looking them over decided on the Panasonic ES0-SA40-K. It costs less than a new shaving head for the Norelco.    When it arrived I tried it out sitting the living room out of the box without charging.  I checked in the mirror and even after one pass without looking the shave was almost as close as a blade shave.    I can&#x27;t imagine what the more expensive Panasonics can offer to be better than this shaver.  I am a convert. I do admit that there is a slight burn like any close shave and if this is bothersome a lotion aftershave may be worthwhile.    I am truly amazed by this shaver.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for.. Sounds wise huh?  Well it is wise. This cheap electric shaver turns on and make lovely sounds but it doesnt actually shave. I&#x27;m a regular person, no hard hair or anything and I tried for a while to shave with this item and it wouldnt cut my hair.   I read the instructions and all and tried and tried but it wouldnt do anything besides a sound.   I stopped trying when I cut myself, yes It wouldnt cut my hair but it did cut my skin.   I&#x27;m not saying it wont work for you, but it certainly didnt worked for me.   Save a couple more bucks and go for a good shaver.</li>
            <li> bought this shaver after reading some positive reviews here on amazon.    honestly, i bought this shaver because of the price.  i had a 10yr old remington that was decent, but the mesh was deteriorating, and thought i would just buy a new shaver for about the same price as the new mesh.      this panasonic is surprisingly quiet, and works well, although i have to run it over my face more times than the old remington.  it charges by sitting in a dock that plugs directly into the outlet, so it&#x27;s convenient for some, but makes no difference for me.  holds a charge for a decent amount of time.  i do like the fact that i can run it under water to rinse it clean.  i have only used it dry, not wet or with shaving cream, and it works well dry.    overall i&#x27;m satisfied with this panasonic and for the price, it&#x27;s a good value.</li>
            <li> This is my 6th panasonic single blade shaver. The closest, most comfortable shave in the shower. I&#x27;ve tried multible head shavers, and prefer the single head model.</li>
            <li> Tried this product wet &amp; dry, does not work on the neck or under chin. had to re shave with a razor. I will probably throw this shaver out. At least I&#x27;m not out allot of money. I guess you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> I had an older Panasonic shaver that I had for 7 years and when I needed a new one, I was happy to find the newer improved version of what I had. It works great even in the shower, I love that I can use it without worrying that water will damage it. The shave is great too. Shipping was fast. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Single head-shaves much better than more expensive double or triple head models.Use gel rather than cream.</li>
            <li> if u want clean cut use razor, this trimmer is great dont get me wrong, but it just wont shave my neck hair, i can pretty much on use it to shave off facial hair above the chin, not below, if you are looking to spend $30 and get a mediocre trimmer that does its job, above the chin line, this is for you,. if you are looking for ALL OUT facial hair shaver/trimmer, spend the few hundred bucks to get a mac daddy kind</li>
            <li> I bought this for a relative in a nursing home, but wanted to try it first. I used it dry. It left most of my slightly longer hairs behind. Worse, there was residue all over the shaving head, very messy. It did clean up easily under running water. Back to Braun.</li>
            <li> Due to recent neck surgery, which left several serious and very tender incisions on the part of my neck which has been typically difficult to shave, I was looking for a safe  electric razor option that would:     1. allow me to shave safely in the shower     2. not create a cutting possibility of the incision areas     3. would give sufficient control in an area that was very numb and very tender     4. allowed triming of longer (half-inch) beard growth in areas that had escaped my regular razor for a month (this was accoplished with the very effective sideburn and beard trimming cutter built into the razor).    I am absolutely thrilled with this fine little machine.  It provided a solution to a specialized problem and it has proven to be safe and effective.  The quality of the razor is high grade:  it has sufficient weight and   balance to use it confidently with plenty of control and feedback.  This razor has never cut or irritated either my skin or the wound incisions. The quality of materials is very high, the fit and finish is exceptional.    The battery seems very strong and I recharge after every 3 or 4 uses. This razor is easy to clean and maintain.  I am typically a very picky consumer, but I have never wavered once in my admiration of this razor&#x27;s design   and function.  Highly recommended, particularly in my specialized kind of application.</li>
            <li> This razor is my third one now. The last one is still in great working condition, but has been put away as a backup for me. I love this electric, wet-dry razor! It has never let me down, always runs perfectly, is so easy to hold onto, and will give me a shave that is unsurpassed in comparison to electric razors that are made especially for women. I&#x27;ve tried them all! This razor will give one a close smooth shave on every area of a female&#x27;s body. It&#x27;s wonderful, and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Works great right out the box.  Looks cheap but use great, the charger only works for wall sockets due to its orientation.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful electric shaver. It is fast, it shaves well and it doesn&#x27;t cost a whole lot.  If I might be gross, it is far and away the best inside the ear and inside the nose shaver I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This unit shaves pretty good the drawback I found is trimmer for side burns don&#x27;t cut so easily but don&#x27;t pull hairs either so thats a plus and it does great for nose hair and small amounts of side burn hairs but don&#x27;t expect to cut hair like a hair cutter. Good in the shower also. I still use it and will keep it but not the quality as a Braun shavers.</li>
            <li> when i saw the package it looked very stylish and durable. Even more, it gave me the smoothest shave ever and i hv never used a manual razor on my face so this was my first time using any shaver. I was a little nervous but after it gave me tht smooth shave, it felt really clean. I would recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin because i have sensitive skin and it hasn&#x27;t given me any rash so far. Thank you Panasonic and Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have been using Panasonic razors for many years and was always pleased with them. My last previous Panasonic needed to be replaced due to battery failure. In shopping Amazon I found an Eltron model that outwardly appeared to be a Panasonic and it had a great price. It was not a Panasonic. Because I misunderstood the specs I used it in the shower as I had been doing with my Panasonics. It failed due to moisture in the circuitry.  It was time for a REAL Panasonic. I love it and get very good shaves.</li>
            <li> This is most certainly not the greatest razor, as it does have difficulties with longer hairs. It is however definitely worth the 25 dollars if you&#x27;re on a tight budget. Definitely buy.</li>
            <li> Looking for a inexpensive shaver that will perform great?. Look no more. This shaver feels solid in you hand. It is very well make and durable. More that a year with one. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my boyfriend. He loves it. For the low price I was kind of worried it would not work very well, but it works great. I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I bought this shave because I´ve very sensitive skin and blades were cutting my face every single day. After first use, I can´t believe it! I can get a great shave without any scratch! If you´re looking for a shaver for your sensitive skin this Panasonic ES-SA40-K Pro is your best choice for less money.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for an inexpensive shaver that works very good buy this one.  I&#x27;ve used more expensive shavers and this one is just as good as most of them.  Why spend 2-3xs more if you don&#x27;t have to!!</li>
            <li> Very nice razor for a quick shave.  If you have always used a safety razor, I suggust doing as the manual says and give the razor a 30 day period of use to allow your skin to adjust.  The \\&quot;wet\\&quot; mode was a little disappointing, as it irritated my face more than the dry mode...but that could just be me.  I have found Panasonic products to be quite reliable.</li>
            <li> I waited 4 days to shave knowing this was coming in.  I wanted to put it to the test.  Out of the box, it had a strong charge and shaved great!    Usually you have to wait weeks for your face to get used to an electric razor, it didnt matter.    Great razor!  Great Price!</li>
            <li> I have wanted to get an electric shaver since I am pretty lazy and hate using a straight edge. This shaver was relatively cheap and can be used wet or dry which is nice. However, it takes some time to get a consistent shave. It&#x27;s not the best on the neck, have to spend a decent amount of time to get all the hairs. I would say it hasn&#x27;t sped up my shaving process, but its nice to be able on a whim to get a quick trim, without having to use lather and hot water.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a shaver to replace my old Braun foil shaver.  Braun recently changed their foil design, and the new foil is just terrible.  Luckily, I bought this Panasonic and it works like the old Braun.&lt;br /&gt;June 2013:  Unfortunately, they no longer make this shaver anymore.</li>
            <li> awesome. the price is right for this one. cant beat it for what it does, simple quick shave. i use it to clean up the rest of my face after a line up and i love it..</li>
            <li> Shaver is not worth $ 10 they do not cut the hair I do not know what makes Panasonic products, so</li>
            <li> Razor works great for a single foil cutter. But after about 6 uses the trimmer tugs hair and pulls even with oil and cleaning of trimmer regulary. recommend shaver even though the trimmer is sub par.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean and provides a nice smooth shave for someone who cannot, or does not want to, deal with a high maintenance cordless shaver. So far, so good!</li>
            <li> Bought this in the starting of 2011. It is August end and it is still working like new. Is a little noisy (that&#x27;s why 4 star) otherwise it is the best one can get.</li>
            <li> Does not shave as good as a bigger model but is nice for travel, compact and easy to pack and that is great.</li>
            <li> It has been decades since I&#x27;ve used an electric razor. The battery in my old one died years ago and it was fairly heavy so I threw it out and ordered this one after reading the reviews. I was concerned about the \\&quot;break in\\&quot; period some suggested was needed. However, when I used it for the first time, I felt no pulls or nicks, my skin was not irritated and... to my big surprise... the shave was as close as some of mine with a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tested the battery life yet, but am very pleased with the shaver. It is light and easily taken with me on trips, or used to \\&quot;tidy up\\&quot; if I want to go out without looking like Richard Nixon!</li>
            <li> Got this razor to take care of my facial hair. I found the first time shaving that I needed to shave using the sideburn trimmer first for my entire neck (my hair was maybe half an inch long at the longest) and followed up with the regular razor for a reasonably close shave. I do not recommend using it wet, I found that with wet hair the sideburn trimmer will clog easily and pinch you or tug at your skin. For the price, it does about the same thing as my older (deceased) braun 150 series.</li>
            <li> I have used this shaver now for a number of months and am impressed. I bought this mainly for travel and occasional use at home. For less than one third the price of my fancier Panasonic shaver, I&#x27;d say this one shaves about 90% (or better) as close. And this is based on only using it dry whereas I always use my expensive Panasonic wet. I&#x27;m happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone wanting a low-priced shaver.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband a few months ago.  Decided to purchase this particular one because it good reviews and was easy on the wallet.  My husband has never liked electric shavers, so an inexpensive one was the best way to test if he&#x27;d use it.  To my surprise, he uses almost daily and likes it!  Decent shaver from what I can tell, nothing fancy at all.  Good bang for the buck!  And my husband shaves more often.  Double plus!</li>
            <li> I will be brief as you read all the reviews on here.  I don&#x27;t have a beard so I don&#x27;t need a 2 or more blades to shave.  Charger is somewhat bulky, but, still does a great job.  It does a good job of shaving, quality is solid and doesn&#x27;t take me long to shave.  Done within 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> wow what a sweet shaver this do its job n then some...very very very close shave and very powerful had it for almost a year n still running like new.</li>
            <li> I liked the product was what I expected and very good quality to recommend them all very good product when I can come back to buy</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even tried shaving with this thing yet.  Doesn&#x27;t matter - it could give the best shave in the world and I&#x27;d still give it one star.  \\&quot;But why?\\&quot;, you ask.  I CAN&#x27;T CHARGE IT IN MY BATHROOM!!!!  I have three bathrooms in my house, and in every bathroom, a medicine cabinet is located directly above the outlet.  Pictures don&#x27;t show it, but this shaver plugs directly into the top of the wall wart that plugs into the outlet. There is no cord!  There is no more than 1\\&quot; of clearance between the shaver and the wall when it is plugged into its charging system. My medicine cabinets all stick out farther, by the time you factor in the trim and the door thickness.  I have 4 outlets, and 4 medicine cabinets, and am unable to plug in this shaver in any bathroom outlet in my entire house.  Also, please note (as one other low-score reviewer did) that horizontally mounted outlets are out of the question - the shaver cannot be charged if the wall wart is plugged into a horizontal outlet.  Fortunately, I had no intention of using this - it&#x27;s headed to my son in Afghanistan.  I&#x27;m pretty sure they don&#x27;t have medicine cabinets in tents. I just hope he has access to an outlet!</li>
            <li> Used to be a Remington man, but they discontinued their very good low end model in lieu of a new crappy one. This Panasonic doesn&#x27;t shave quite as close, but it is quieter, more ergonomic, has a better blade cover, and has a unique, effective charger. And for the money, it is a great little shaver. The question is how long it lasts...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this razor for about 5 weeks now and am very satisfied with the performance, especially for the price I paid. I&#x27;m still finding it hard to believe  it cost less than $30, considering the quality. I would definitely recommend this shaver to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The PROS: First, the feel. Don&#x27;t let the light weight of this shaver fool you - despite that, it feels solid in your hand and there&#x27;s almost no vibration transmitted to your wrist. Along with the single foil design, this allows for very precise shaving - that&#x27;s a key for me, since I have a very angular face. Most electric shavers can&#x27;t reach the hairs under my jawbone, but this one can. Second, the comfort level and closeness of the shave is outstanding, especially when using wet. I have to admit, the first time I tried using shaving cream with this razor I was skeptical - but the results were astounding. Most days, I don&#x27;t bother with shaving cream. I just wash my face and leave it wet, then shave and the results are still far better than I&#x27;ve ever had with any other electric shaver. Also, I wear a mustache and chin beard and I find this is able to shave next to it without pulling on the longer hairs. The built-in beard trimmer is a little unusual in design, but it actually works out very well. Finally, the battery life is terrific. I shave nearly every day with this (probably 5-10 minutes per shave) and only need one overnight charge per week. Actually, I charge that often more out of caution than necessity, since the razor still has charge on it when I plug it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CONS: The are a few things about the shaver that could be improved, but really for the price you can&#x27;t complain. Most annoying is the charging base. It&#x27;s so large it takes up both outlets in a standard bathroom. I&#x27;ve overcome this by using an extension cord, but it is annoying. Second, my beard is very thick and tough (I still blame my drill instructors for that!) and in 30+ years of shaving I&#x27;ve never found an electric that shaves as close as the old tried and true blade and water. This gets closer than most, but I still find I need to revert to a manual razor at least one every other week. I suppose a charge level indicator would be nice, but that&#x27;s a feature I&#x27;ve only seen on much more expensive razors.</li>
            <li> At first I said this, \\&quot;This is the only electric shaver I have used that I like.  If you are a blade shaver, you may want to consider it.  It can be used on airline travel.  YOU CAN NOT USE SHAVING CREAMS OR GELS.  Works well for about a week and then the blade goes dull and  then it ain&#x27;t worth s***.  It is on a par with one of those shavers you get at the hospital when your in for several days: a throwaway.</li>
            <li> It does an adequate job on short stubble.  Don&#x27;t even try longer hairs.  No sideburn trimmer.  If you want a really close shave go back to your 5 blade plastic wonders.  I like that it&#x27;s wet dry.  I like that it holds a charge for a weekend.</li>
            <li> I years ago stopped trying to maintain the illusion that I was not going bald by coming over hair from the sides, nose, back, ears, eyelashes, etc.  And with that, I stopped spending the money on haircuts, replacing them with an endless supply of disposable razors and a Remington Rotary Razor that I got several years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The truth is that using a regular razor on my head is slow and tedious.  Not only do you have to be careful about not cutting yourself (which I&#x27;ve done on far too many occasions), but you can spend ten or twenty minutes going over every bit only to find an hour later you&#x27;ve got a little island of hairs on one corner of your head that you&#x27;re convinced everyone spots immediately.  And if you happen to go a day or two without shaving it, you&#x27;re faced with the whole ordeal all over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a relatively ancient three head Remington razor that was relatively useless. The shaver&#x27;s power was weak off battery and the cord it was attached to was not long enough or tight enough to enable me to shave without essentially hugging a wall.  I finally started my quest to find a decent alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic ES-SA40-K Pro Curve Wet/Dry Shaver is the perfect combination of performance and low cost.  After reading reviews for several much more expensive razors, I found this one on Amazon and decided to bite the bullet.  It has been a worthwhile purchase.  Unlike my old rotary razor, I get a lot of coverage on the razor&#x27;s foil with which to run the razor over my head.  This means that I can shave my head more quickly and confidently.  As an added bonus, it works well wet or dry.  The razor is light enough and well contoured enough that I can easily hold it without is falling in the shower.  Its controls are simple and the razor foil gently glides over my head and face and provides an adequate shave for daily maintenance of my head, and for a decent enough facial appearance for the weekends.  While it isn&#x27;t as close or clean as a regular razor, it is perfect for my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  This razor charges by being snapped directly into a wall transformer, so if your bathroom plug is not oriented with one plug under another or is in a tight spot, you may not be able to use this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good performance on a budget&lt;br /&gt;Works well on the scalp&lt;br /&gt;Great for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;Holds a charge for several days.&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper than a few months of razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;Wall transformer/charger keeps razor off of counter.&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable and easy to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long charge time (8 hours)&lt;br /&gt;Essentially disposable since repairing and replacing blade/foil is expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Wall transformer/charger needs more space than other razors&lt;br /&gt;Not as close as a blade.fect for my head.    Note:  This razor charges by being snapped directly into a wall transformer, so if your bathroom plug is not oriented with one plug under another or is in a tight spot, you may not be able to use this razor.    PROS    Good performance on a budget  Works well on the scalp  Great for everyday use.    Holds a charge for several days.    Cheaper than a few months of razor blades.    Wall transformer/charger keeps razor off of counter.    Comfortable and easy to hold.   CONS   Long charge time (8 hours)  Essentially disposable since repairing and replacing blade/foil is expensive.    Wall transformer/charger needs more space than other razors   Not as close as a blade.</li>
            <li> for single blade this is probably the best shaver i have ever had and i have had over 7 shavers.  close and comfortable shave everytime. one drawback is that you must keep it charge. does not come with cord for ac/dc shaving..excellent product nonetheless...</li>
            <li> I used the previous model of this shaver for many years until the battery would no longer hold a charge. The new model has a few cosmetic changes but the same excellent performance.</li>
            <li> I only use my electric shaver on the weekends, so I am not that picky about its performance.  This shaver performs ok, about the same as most, but there are probably ones that shave closer (for more money).  I bought this one because the replacement parts are relatively cheap.  Note that the charger for this shaver is incompatible with outlets with horizontal slots, a very common arrangement here in the Chicago area. Otherwise, the charger is fairly nice - no messy chord.  The shaver plugs directly into the \\&quot;wall wart\\&quot;.  The rechargeable battery is NiMH, which means that it is okay to leave it fully charged most of the time - no need to drain it down like the older NiCad batteries.</li>
            <li> I have worn out 8 of these shavers over the years. They were trouble-free. Unfortunately, it costs too much to replace the cutting head and foil, so I just buy a new one.Heads and foil for most razors are simply overpriced!</li>
            <li> This shaver did not provide the shave I was hoping for.  I was left with a 5 0&#x27;clock shadow and it was 7 am., and it took several minutes to get that.  I tried it for 4 weeks and then sent it back.  The higher end Panasonic shavers may work better.  Back to my Norelco for now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for about a month now and am very pleased with it.  Low price, good shave, and a trimmer that works decently.  What&#x27;s not to like?  My old Braun system 3 probably gave a slightly better shave, but at 1/5th the price it is hard to beat the Panasonic.  The Braun foils seemed to be wearing out much more quickly than they used to also, and the price for a replacement foil and cutter was almost as much as the Panasonic costs.</li>
            <li> I was reading reviews over  and over, and they all were consisted on saying it was the best shaver ever! Well, I made up my mind, and decided to give it a try... The day came, and I received my shaver, nice style, great grip... Not so good at shaving! It took me 20 minutes to removed 5 days beard, and it didn&#x27;t remove it as I wanted it. I had to use a razor, again, to end the job!</li>
            <li> I got this razor after reading the good reviews. And I have to agree, for the price of this razor, it performs very well.   The only drawback I&#x27;ve found is that to get some neck hairs you have to use the trimmer on the side.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor to replace a Panasonic that would no longer hold charge after 10 years of use. This item is a bit noiser than the old model, but performs as well. I do not use an electric razor on a daily basis, but this satisfies my needs. I appreciate the cordless charging feature, allowing it to plug directly into electric receptacle. As usual, ordering and shipment from Amazon was fast and flawless.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shaver (and it&#x27;s almost identical predecessors) for well over ten years. It&#x27;s a simple design and works as advertised. I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else or even trying another brand/type. It&#x27;s that good!    I typically get two years out of the blade set. The razor (on Amazon) is only $5.00 more than these replacements and if I hit the site right shipping is included. With that in mind it&#x27;s simpler to just buy a complete new razor.    The batteries have never failed on any of my razors. The edge trimmer is also well-designed for it&#x27;s intended purpose.    I usually use the razor wet. When the blade set gets older I might use soap from time-to-time if I let my beard go for a few days. A small brush is included and cleaning is simple under running water or dry    Don&#x27;t let the price fool you. This is a high-quality, well-designed and manufactured product.</li>
            <li> This is my third or fourth Panasonic Wet/Dry shaver.  It is the first one of this model.  I have found all of them to be great products and find using an electric shaver with shave cream is the best way for me to shave.  My only ding on any of the models I have owned is the reason I am on my fourth shaver.  The replacement blades and foils are so expensive that once you figure in shipping, it is usually only a couple dollars more to buy a whole new shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought 2,one for my 14 yr. old son and one for me.I have a \\&quot;day and a half beard\\&quot; so each morning it is not ready to shave with an electric razor-until now.It works great with lather and almost as good dry.Also very efective on my son&#x60;s peach fuzz.Very reasonably priced for this high quality.I don&#x60;t think any one would go wrong with this razor.</li>
            <li> The battery life on this thing lasts forever. You have to push hard in order to get a clean shave, but its good enough for a daily trim.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver. Its my second and Its much better than the hand-me-down shaver my dad let me use. Its great, fast, holds a charge nicely, and rinses easily. I only wish that there was an accessory cleaning dock I could get for it. I havent needed to travel with it yet but it looks like it would travel very well, comes with a great cover for the blade. Worth the money I made my parents pay for it.</li>
            <li> It does shave you. It has trouble with the neck curvatures and if you are not careful you will get skin burns. BUT I&#x27;m new to electric shavers and this may be a norm.</li>
            <li> This shaver seems to be working very well, but especially in the first few months.  It has since dulled slightly, but it works fine. Every few days, though, I have to run it under water and let it air dry before using it again. Either way, it was a very good deal, so I&#x27;d recommend it</li>
            <li> I have been using Braun single foil shavers for many years and the one I got a year ago just never cut, so I thought I&#x27;d try the Panasonic ES-SA40-K which got fairly good reviews. I have to say this is the best shaver I have ever used. I have trimmed facial hair so only need to shave neck and around the trimmed areas which is why I like single foils. This shaver shaves on the first pass so in about 15-20 seconds I&#x27;m done. The only thing that might be a little odd is the charger, but it stores nice without the cord. I don&#x27;t impress easily, but I&#x27;m enjoying using this shaver. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Cheaper than the foil and cutter replacement for my Braun Series 7. Feels cheap and the sideburns trimer feels really cheap but thats eclipsed by its ability. Best shave so far. You have to recharge every 3 shaves though. All in all amazing for the price.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I decided to try the less expensive ES-SA40-K shaver and I&#x27;m very pleased that I did. I have what I consider a moderate beard and the shaver works great on all areas of the face and neck. I use it daily and needed to charge it once over the first 4 weeks. If it continues to perform this well, it will certainly retain the 5-star rating I gave it. I had an old Braun ~ 20 years old that worked well, but finally died. I&#x27;m very pleased with the performance and price of the Panasonic. I only use it dry. PS: My father had an older Panasonic and liked it so much (still working) that he asked me to send him one of these.</li>
            <li> Best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;I like it even better than my $80+ panasonic self cleaning shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Smooth and non-irritating on the skin, easy to clean, very fast.&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint is I wish the sideburn trimmer didn&#x27;t stick straight out the back,&lt;br /&gt;because if I lay it flat on a counter it&#x27;s resting right on those blades.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Not as the close shave as I expected out of it. Got it for my boyfriend who needs to have a clean shave daily. Can&#x27;t quite complain for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this as part of a present for my boyfriend. He has used it a couple times, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be working as promised. This razor does not provide a clean shave and he has to go over the same spot 3-4 (+) times for it to actually be effective.  The sideburn trimmer appears to work somewhat more effectively, however, this is going to be returned! Guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> For the closest smoothest shave you cannot go wrong with this. While it does require a few passes in various directions, the end result is comparable to a razor (and less the mess and cleanup). To get an even closer shave this can simply be taken into a hot shower. The beard trimmer is great as well. Excellent product, would recommend to anyone for trimming thick facial or body hair.</li>
            <li> Not that close of a shave and it broke when I dropped it once.  Never got to use it again and went to a Philips brand.</li>
            <li> The trimmer on this shaver cut my skin and pulled my hair regarledd of whether the hairs were short or long. The trimmer was a huge problem for this shaver.  The shaver itself performed OK, but less well than my 2 year old 1-series Braun (which had a working trimmer, btw) I sought to replace with this Panasonic. Even brand new with fresh blades it had a hard time giving me the not-so-close shave my cheap Braun gave me.   I wanted to get away from Braun because the motor died after only two years of irregular use (used a razor, grew a beard, etc.), but Panasonic got my hopes up only briefly before ripping them apart sorta like the trimmer on this shaver did to my neck.  The form factor and design we cheap (as expected) but I could find no major flaws. The foil is not particularly wide, but that&#x27;s not a huge detractor, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used double edge, straight razors and most electric razors over 40 years.Prefer straight razors but they take time and practice.I have switched from Bruan to&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic because they offer better shaves from a selection of lower priced units according to review sites. The Panasonic ES-SA40-K Pro Curve Wet/Dry Shaver took about a week for my face to get used to. Tried it wet shaving at first, but it cut me to the point of bleeding too easily. It does a better job dry shaving me. I&#x27;m in my mid 50&#x27;s with a dry tender face, medium hair strength, multiple napp angles. In a high altitude cooler and dry climate. The shaver leaves some felt stubble right after I&#x27;m done shaving but which turns smooth to the touch after applying after shave. I&#x27;d give this particular unit four stars because it gets the job done and was under $100.00 dollars so it was very afordable with wet/dry use. How long it will last might be another matter as anybody can tell you &#x27;it&#x27;s all planned obsolescents for greater profit per quarter&#x27;. This is my first Panasonic shaver. Remember people, take care of your tools because they just don&#x27;t last as long as they used to!</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my head, for which it works great. Lasts about 3 full shaves in between charges, and still runs after that, but I can feel it getting sluggish. Doesn&#x27;t work worth crap on the face though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like any electric, not as close a shave as a manual shave, but does the job well for me, use it every two days. Works great in and out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of this razor and it charges well.  What I don&#x27;t like is the shave.  I saw several reviews mentioned that it grabbed skin, so I was a little concerned when I bought it.  I never had a problem with it catching skin, but every time I use it there are a half dozen to a dozen hairs left and I go up and down, down and up, left to right, right to left (so basically 4 shaves).  I imagine the skin grabbers probably pushed hard to try to get these errant hairs.  If I&#x27;m going out, I just use a non-electric razor.  I have no problem with the closeness of the shave, where it shaves.</li>
            <li> This thing is an utter waste of money. It is junk. It does not cut facial hair even those that are trim to minute level.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few others over the years, but like my Panasonic single blade the best. The only down side is that the trimmer doesn&#x27;t stick out, it just slides up, which makes it tougher to get it where you want it. My last shaver was a dual blade Panasonic which has a smaller but more useful trimmer that flips out. The dual blade model wasn&#x27;t as durable and the battery would barely last 2 weeks on a charge. The single blade models I have had over the years start with a battery life of approximately 1 month between charges!! I&#x27;ve had my new one for over 3 weeks and it&#x27;s going strong on the first charge (used daily). They have typically have a life span lasting 2-3 years before the battery gives out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one also shaves closer and faster than the dual blade model I had. Some shavers tend to grab and pull a whisker now and then - ouch! The Panasonic has what I call a direct drive design which cuts clean and fast with no pulling. I highly recommend this model!  My \\&quot;beard\\&quot; is light, which helps, but I have never even had to change the blades. Just buy a new shaver every 2-3 years. Great product!</li>
            <li> No, seriously. This doesn&#x27;t shave your face at all. SERIOUSLY. You&#x27;ll be lucky if two hairs get shaved down, and even then the shave on those two hairs will be substandard. I&#x27;ve bought products that were DOA but never in my life bought a product that was fully functional and yet did not perform one iota of its function. It&#x27;s like a high powered computer that includes everything and comes at a great deal, except the one footnote is that it will not allow you to use a mouse or keyboard. But everything else works! I knew I was being a cheapskate when I got this, but somehow I thought I could trust a brand like Panasonic to at least give me a rough shave. I sort of expected that it would at least be able to cut hair. Since then I&#x27;ve learned that to be a miser, instead of buying the cheapest product, you should buy the second cheapest product. The next line up. A cheap razor is criminally expensive if it does not work--it wastes your time, and if you buy it from a store like I did, it wastes two trips of gas.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this purchase for about three months. The second paragraph is my original review and shows my previous endorsement of the product. Unfortunately the shaver no longer holds a charge so I am unable to use it. I failed to notice that this shaver does not have dual voltage unlike my previous Norelco shaver which was roughly the same price. It should also be noted that the shaver does vibrate more than what I am used to and does not possess a corded option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in China, and I cannot find an electric razor of this quality at this price in my city. Previously I have owned Norelco razors with three flexing heads, but I like the ES-SA40-K&#x27;s floating head with a single blade. This Panasonic is a good-looking wet/dry shaver with an outer foil which easily pops off so that it can be rinsed clean with water. As indicated in some other reviews, longer hairs are difficult to cut, but this model contains a slide up full-width trimmer which can be used to groom moustaches and sideburns. The operating instructions do indicate that my face needs one month to adjust to this new razor, and I have only been using it for one week. Unlike my previous razors, this shaver&#x27;s charging adaptor serves as a nice little stand which allows you to complete a charge in eight hours. This gives you approximately 20 minutes of cordless shaving time. Unfortunately there is no corded option so your batteries must always contain some charge in order to use the razor. The limited warranty allows you to exchange defective rechargeable batteries within two years. Panasonic recommends that the outer foil be replaced once every year and the inner blade once every two years. These items cost approximately $10 each. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The prise is good; however, the product is even better! If you are searching for a good shaver, that is strong and last for some time for sure you´ll like it!</li>
            <li> I bought this in May 2010. (It&#x27;s March 2012 now) and this thing is still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;It might benefit from a foil change but it&#x27;s totally usable and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling scratchy like a blunt razor used to.&lt;br /&gt;It is irritating to use at first (for both mind and skin) but once you get the hang of it and brake it in, it&#x27;s much better than a regular razor for day to day use.&lt;br /&gt;I use it dry, usually after a shower, works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is my first electric razor and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Excellently crafted, the shaver holds a charge for weeks. The foil is not irritating and fits the contours of my face well. The pop-up trimmer is easy to use.  Cleaning is a breeze.</li>
            <li> Electrical Plug is for Europe. I live in the US. Returning the product!!  Battery died in first two weeks.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shaver for a week now (dry shaving) and I love it. The motor is powerful, it shaves really closely (almost as good as a razor), it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and it is pretty quiet. Somehow, the foil only needs to be replaced once a year and the blades only need to be replaced every other year. And they only cost $21 together! How cool is that?! The foil and blades on my last shaver needed to be replaced every six months.    It boggles my mind why anyone would spend $100+ for electric shavers when this guy goes for $24 (I bought it off here for $30 - dang!). Get this shaver!</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;shaver\\&quot; works ok on the majority of my face, but under my chin it does nothing but cause pain. I have used it for a couple of weeks now and it has not improved one bit. My chin is in pain and still not shaved. It leaves random hairs everywhere especially if your hair is longer than a day or two of stubble. All in all, don&#x27;t buy this razor unless you&#x27;re into paying for pain. It is such a piece of junk. I had another cheap razor before this one that I lost, which I am going to purchase again after this experience. It worked great. It was a simple rotary shaver, I can&#x27;t remember the brand. Anyway, my main question is: Why would Panasonic release something as horrible as this?</li>
            <li> Charge lasts a long time.  easy to use and charge. love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for about a month now, and it holds a charge well and works well.  No complaints here!</li>
            <li> I ordered this $25 razor because my Remington broke (the trimmer would not retract).  Since I&#x27;m on a serious budget, I looked for one that had decent reviews.  Let me qualify that I am not a caveman or anything, and blonde.  So shaving is not a huge ordeal.  I also am not the kind of guy who needs to have baby smooth face.  Just want it to look shaved.  I am really liking this razor.  It&#x27;s not a super close shave, but it does the job, and the battery lasts me at least a few weeks with daily shaves.  It&#x27;s small, light, and works well.  It may have issues on some thicker, darker hair, but I can&#x27;t answer to that.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price.  Have had it for two months and it needs charging about once a week.  It&#x27;s light and has the extra trimmer.  So far, I&#x27;m pleased with the shaving performance for the price you pay.</li>
            <li> I bought this item, really not expecting for it to be anything other than average.  Well, after using it for a month, I am extremely pleased with this shaver.  I use it every single day, sometimes twice a day.  It is light weight, yet it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap, but rather well built. It is compact and easy to maneuver around my hairline (I have a gotee). The trimmer leaves a bit to be desired, but I didn&#x27;t buy it for that.  It&#x27;s not so bad that I would change my rating to a 4.  Another huge advantage to this thing is that I have had it a month now, and other than the initial overnight charge, I have never charged it once.  Buy this shaver.  I really don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had a much older model of this shaver and it lasted for over a decade. This one seems sleeker and runs faster. It&#x27;s simple and it works well. Mine came charged over a week ago and I have used it everyday with the same charge it came with.</li>
            <li> Only used a few times, but very painless/easy shave, and nice being cordless! Takes quite a while to fully charge, but not a big deal since i&#x27;m only using a few minutes at a time to do a quick shave in the morning. the wet/dry option is really nice too. No way you find a better electric shaver for under $30.</li>
            <li> Review of the Panasonic ES-SA40-K&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to get this razor based on 2 things. firstly, all the great reviews and then of course the low price. It seemed win/win. I have had the [[ASIN:B000050FDQ Braun 7526 Syncro Shaver System with Clean &amp; Charge Storage Stand]] for well over a decade. Braun razors hands down were the best razors that you could get until gillette /proctor-gamble acquired the company in 2005. Then things went downhill. I kept my 7526 alive for as long as I could but it no longer holds a charge. I could use it with the cord but that required me to be tethered and I really missed the portability. The loss of portability and the fact that I needed a new foil and blade, I decided to try this Panasonic ES-SA40-K because the entire shaver cost about the same as a new foil and blade for the Braun. Because the ES-Sa40 can be used wet, I knew full well that it has a cordless charge design and I will not be able to do a quick shave regardless of the current charge status. The Braun was corded so you could plug it in at any time and shave. At the time it did not seem like a big deal to me but I really miss the cord when the charge starts pooping out in the middle of a shave. The motor is very underpowered. I have a light beard with thin hair and the razor sounded like it was mowing 8 inch grass. It would audibly struggle when I would shave. I couldn&#x27;t imagine how this would even work if you are one of those Yeti type hairy guys. The shave is quite average. It takes a long time with repeatedly shaving the same area over and over until achieving an acceptable shave. I have many, many hairs that the shaver will just not get and have to be tweezed. A few tweezed hairs is always acceptable when using electric razors. It comes with the territory. But this was ridiculous. I spent as much time tweezing as I did shaving. There are a few good points. Surprisingly the trimmer is great! It&#x27;s one of the widest trimmers that I have seen. Being able to rinse the razor instead of the expensive cartridge cleaning system that My Braun uses is a HUGE plus. Being able to use it in the shower is nice but in reality I rarely use it it the shower. It has a pretty good battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So ultimately I have yet to find a replacement for my Braun. I may have to just bite the bullet and cough up the 200 bucks and just get the new Braun knowing that it will cost more and is of lower quality than my old 7526. I have already bought and returned the series 7 shaver because it did not compare to the 7526.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still glad that I have the ES-SA40. I keep it in the car for touchup&#x27;s and after-all it&#x27;s only 30 bucks.nstead of the expensive cartridge cleaning system that My Braun uses is a HUGE plus.

            <li> If you want an inexpensive shaver that does it&#x27;s job very well, look no further.  My expectations weren&#x27;t high replacing a high end Panasonic that lasted 10 years. (Battery)  In terms of use and performance, the ES-SA40-K shaves every bit as well, if not better, IMO.  I also purchased the ES-3831-K travel shaver for under $15, and found it uses the same parts.   The WES9979P replacement blade and foil kit costs more than the entire travel shaver itself.  My only complaint is the AC adapter/charger blocks my other wall plug. Aside from that, it&#x27;s PERFECT!!!    Without reservation I highly recommend both of these shavers, and will buy two more as backups.</li>
            <li> My whiskers grow fast. This electric razor, using it everyday, would take me at least 20 minutes to get a semi-close shave. I was disappointed. From all the other reviews I thought this would help me save some time everyday, but boy was I wrong. Hard to get a close, even shave and if I did get a close shave it took at least 20 minutes. It&#x27;s also pretty loud, louder than my trimmer I use for my goatee. It also never gets as clean as other people claim it does or as simply. I&#x27;ll stick with good ol&#x27; shaving cream and a Bic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for about a month and haven&#x27;t needed to charge it. Admittedly I only use it every other day as I&#x27;m bearded and shave just my neck and lower lip area. Still, that&#x27;s pretty impressive in my book. On top of that the shave is close and I don&#x27;t experience any \\&quot;burn\\&quot; or other discomfort.</li>
            <li> This product met my expectations for an electric shaver. I can&#x27;t shave too often or my face will bump up.  This shaver is great as it gives a close shave but is not harsh on your face.  Works great in the shower too.</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s a good electric razor. It doesn&#x27;t get a close shave as a razor blade but the potential cuts are gone.  Very quick cutting , I use it dry and it is  easy to clean. I owned it for over a month and am satisfied with the purchase.   I would buy another when needed.</li>
            <li> Shaves close but has problems with long whiskers. Nice no cord charger, and long run time. It does scare my dog however.</li>
            <li> Got this for my son for xmas. he loves it, especially as it is a wet /dry shaver, definite benefit is the charger that plugs in the wall, the unit does the job when it comes to the in between shaves for sure. Feel like it is a good  product for the price.   Would however not expect for it to be the only shaving unit , if you have normal growth. But for ingrown hairs etc, this is the perfect in between shaver.</li>
            <li> Wow, I was skeptical, but this baby really works. And for only $30 it doesn&#x27;t get much better. Yeah it&#x27;s not \\&quot;one pass\\&quot; and its done but after a couple you&#x27;re good to go - even on the neck! Wet/dry is def. a bonus. It&#x27;s no Braun but like I said, for $30 you can&#x27;t beat this. Used to have a remington dual head foil shaver... this blows it out of the water</li>
            <li> So I used this shaver for the first time and I have to say - wow!  I have been using electric shavers all of my life and this shaver cut my 3 day old hairs effortlessly.  I was looking for a shaver that had a single head, no swivel, and this fit the bill perfectly.  The price (around $28) is also superb.  I am really impressed with this Panasonic shaver.  It feels solid and sturdy.</li>
            <li> Excellent Shaver great for a quick shave. Small, light, portable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mostly use a razor to shave but find this very useful to deal with 5 O&#x27;clock shadow or a quick weekend shave.</li>
            <li> I use it just for around my lips, the regular razor doesn&#x27;t agree with that area for some reason.  The Panasonic works great for small jobs, it doesn&#x27;t do very well on my neck area because my hair lays down flat.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver for the cost!It is quiet and gives a close shave. It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Great little shaver!! Replaced another Panasonic shaver that lasted 14 years with this unit and love this one just as much! Wish it was available again so I could buy one for my son.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor.  It does a good job in a reasonable amount of time.  I bought mine in Apr 2012 and it is still working fine.  I came back to do this review after I bought a different 2-head Panasonic razor which turned out to be very disappointing.  I notice that Amazon no longer fulfills orders for this item.  It is now sold by a third party at a price of $199.  That&#x27;s either a mistake or the vendor is crazy.  If you&#x27;re interested in buying this razor, I recommend it and there are still places which sell it for under $30.</li>
            <li> foil is torn or worn after months... used every other day&lt;br /&gt;but works if you are careful&lt;br /&gt;replacement foil or screen cost 15 bucks but shaver costs 18 or 20 ???&lt;br /&gt;I smell Chineese.. dung</li>
            <li> Junk....did not hold the charge.</li>
            <li> Lasted 3 years before a drop caused a damage to the screen</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement all around electric razor.  I have no complaints after using it over 6 months.  It trims well and am satisified with how it shaves.  Inexpensive too.</li>
            <li> I used this to stay prim and proper throughout the day. I recommend it since it&#x27;s lightweight and portable and runs forever on its batteries</li>
            <li> bought this is a attempt to save on the cost of razor blades but does such a poor job I am back to using razors.</li>
            <li> This shaver gives as good a shave as other more expensive wet/dry Panasonics I&#x27;ve owned. Biggest drawback is it is much louder than the ~$40 shavers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the fanciest razor, but for the money it&#x27;s amazing.  Waterproof and durable, this handy little razor will serve you well.</li>
            <li> I love this Razor - when fully charged it works GREAT - holds a charge for a decent amount of time. For the price it&#x27;s the best on the market. Have had it 3 years and it never fails. Panasonic still makes GREAT Products. Not sure if it&#x27;s made in Japan still but it&#x27;s GREAT. Will get a 2nd as a backup - look no further for electric Razor this is the ONE and GREAT price.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly good performance from such an inexpensive product. Gives a very close shave with some discomfort. After overdoing it in the neck area, there was some burning sensation that is avoided by not overdoing it. Don&#x27;t keep going over an area once it&#x27;s shaved, leave it alone. Seems to work better and is definitely more comfortable in the shower. In my opinion, results are comparable to expensive floating-head models at a fraction of the cost. We&#x27;ll see how it holds up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feb 2013: The shaver did not hold up well. I should have reposted much sooner but I forgot about this product after I threw it in the trash. \\&quot;Some discomfort\\&quot; soon escalates into serious discomfort and abrasion. I stopped using this item soon after buying it. Not recommended.</li>
            <li> Guys, Can you advise how the the trimmer performs?.Or just for the shaver we shall pick this?</li>
            <li> After reading the multitudes of reviews, some which included phrases such as \\&quot;close and comfortable shave every-time\\&quot; and \\&quot;just as close as a razor\\&quot; etc... I was expecting a little more from the ES-SA40. Perhaps my facial hair type is really different (not thick, a little on the light side) but I had to do some work to get all the hair off: going over the hair multiple times, and you will most likely have to use the secondary trimmer to finish up.   So for me it wasn&#x27;t as easy and care free as I thought it would be, but I want to make it clear that it is the first shave and I did not use it wet or with gel as some have recommended.       *edit* After the second shave I wanted to say that is actually a very good shaver for the price you get, actually its better than the price. If your looking to save some $ while getting a descent shave, I would recommend.</li>
            <li> The pop-up trimmer and the shaving head both work well. It doesn&#x27;t shave as closely as husband&#x27;s Gillette Mach3 Turbo razor, but he&#x27;s happy with the overall quality of this shaver.</li>
            <li> The battery on this shaver is one of the best rechargeables I&#x27;ve found.  It outperforms my older Panasonic rechargeable with almost a week more use.  Light in the hand and gives as good a shave as many higher priced products.  I have two and recharge one while using the other.</li>
            <li> I like a shaver I can use wet, and this is the cheapest one I can find. I have been using this model for about 10 years, and typically get 1.5 to 2 years out of each. Seems like a better idea than buying one for 5 times the cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second Panasonic wet-dry shaver.  You can&#x27;t beat them for the price.  First one lasted a long time, until the battery stopped recharging.  The shave is probably not as close as you&#x27;d get from some others, but if I want a really close shave I use a razor.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shaver for well over a year without any problems. I use it dry, and I love it. The battery lasts almost a month it seems shaving every day. It feels nice, has a nice charger that holds it up on the wall. This shaver is easy to clean, and I have tested it in the water. It works fine, no oxidation.</li>
            <li> Had one of these many years ago, and when I needed a new one....I couldn&#x27;t find one as I think they didn&#x27;t make them anymore.  Found this one and just used it the other day......wow.  Like a hot knife thru butter.....and for under $30.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric razor for years, but thought I&#x27;d give this one a try.  Do I get a blade close shave - NO.  But I don&#x27;t cut myself either.  Instructions say to give about a month for beard to adjust, and after 3 weeks it seems to be improving.  I&#x27;ve tried shaving in the shower and with shave creme, but I bought lectra shave lotion, and that seems to help get a closer shave. I like everything about the razor other than not getting a real close shave.  I guess I would recommend this razor, but don&#x27;t expect a real close shave.  At least I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I previously used (and still own) the Panasonic ES3041; which judging by the design similarities, was the precursor for the ES-SA40-K. I purchased the ES-SA40-K based off of my experiences with my previous Panasonic shaver, and the price-point.    Pros:  Quick, easy, and relatively smooth shave  Great battery life (even with extended use)  Wet/Dry (probably the biggest selling point aside from my previous experience)  Easy operation (large on/off switch, ergonomic grip)  Easy cleaning    So-so:  Trimmer (great feature, but semi-shabby construction: the assembly is a bit wobbly and can put up a bit of resistance before locking into place)  AC adapter/charger (a bit large, but doubles as a make-shift counter top stand for your shaver when not in use)  Charging time ( 8 hours)    Cons:  Nothing of note.    All-in-all for the price I don&#x27;t think you can beat it. Panasonic delivered and great product in the past; and I expect nothing less from this razor--I doubt I&#x27;ll be let down.     -E</li>
            <li> This is a great little shaver for the money. It out performs several of the higher dollar shavers that I have owned. I have not had it long but if it lasts just a couple of years it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using similar Panasonic shavers since 2000.  This is the 3rd one and, even though the shape/style and model number has changed slightly over the years, it&#x27;s still the same basic single-blade wet/dry shaver I&#x27;ve used for the past 11 years.  I&#x27;ve used some of the Remington&#x27;s and Norelco&#x27;s, but the extra cost didn&#x27;t produce any better shave than these economical Panasonic models.  I use it &#x27;dry&#x27;, but have, on occasion, used it in the shower with great results.  My beard is not real course or rough, so I can&#x27;t say how this shaver would do for guys with tougher beards...but, it works great for me.  It&#x27;s lightweight and fits my hand fine.  The simple charger &#x27;brick&#x27; plugs directly into the wall socket with the shaver snaping into the brick...and precludes the need for a recharge cord.  The push-up trimmer is also a great feature.  Overall, it&#x27;s a fine little shaver.  Nothing fancy, just reliable shaving with good results.</li>
            <li> This is a very good shaver for the price. I get a close shave, ergonomics are good and with an 8 hour charge it will run about a week. I&#x27;ve had very good luck with Panasonic products in the past. My old shavers were Braun, Wahl, and Panasonic, all being the cheaper models and this one is my favorite. This one is also easy to clean and the foil has a nice fit to the shaver itself.</li>
            <li> This is my second ES-SA40-K purchase. The first one was two years old and the foil finally started getting dull. It was just about as cheap to buy a new one as it was to replace the foil and cutter block. I like shaving in the shower with it because it gives my thick beard a closer shave. I think it&#x27;s funny that one of Panasonic&#x27;s best shavers is the least expensive one!</li>
            <li> really durable and works fine in the shower. Very cheap and I like it.</li>
            <li> Always thought one head would be less of a perfect shave.  Not with this baby!  Everything about this is a PLUS with the exception of the charger block.  It takes up valuable AC outlet space.  I&#x27;m trying to figure out a way to put a small extension cord on it and get it off the wall.  I&#x27;ve purchased at least five of these shavers for our own use and for gifts.  Awesome product!</li>
            <li> Now, I used razors my entire life and this was the first electric razor I have ever owned.  I had considered that I would purchase one of these, but never had.  First I like the plug adapter even though I have to make sure it does not fall out of the plug when you put the razor back in. I like the fact it is easy to clean and the straight cutter is good for sideburns.  BUT, I do not care for the so-called close shave, which is severely lacking. No, this thing takes several passes on day old stubble to pick it up.  No, my razor never let me down there.  I thought maybe I missed it on the first two passes...no, again that was not the case here.  The close shave and this instrument just do not go together.  It is good for a quick shave as long as you are not wanted a \\&quot;CLEAN\\&quot; shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this Panasonic ES-SA40 electric shaver to replace a Remington shaver. I purchase the least expensive shavers because they generally cost about the same or a little more than a replacement foil. Generally in the $30.00 range. I have owned somewhere about 30  electric shavers and have found the one blade shavers do a better job than the 2-3-4 blade shavers (and there cheaper). I have owned mostly Braun as I thought they were the best but the Remington was just as good and now I have tried the Panasonic and I love it. The battery is not quite as good as the others but the shave is and that&#x27;s all that counts along with the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a first cordless shaver for my boyfriend, and he absolutely loves it.  The battery stays charged for weeks.  He can use it in the shower, on the road, or anywhere he wants.</li>
            <li> Excelente producto, funciona muy bien seco o mojado, es perfecta para usar con espuma de afeitar, es de f&amp;aacute;cil limpieza... lo recomiendo 100%</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001CS8BJQ Panasonic ES-SA40-K Pro Curve Wet/Dry Shaver, Black]]. The shaver is what I expected it to be. It is too early to give a complete opinion as I have used for about 10 days. It is a good value.</li>
            <li> This razor is decent, however don&#x27;t expect a top shaving experience from it. Usually I have to use the trimmer after I fully shave as it always leaves areas with hair.</li>
            <li> This shaver does such a good job dry, I don&#x27;t know why anyone would bother fussing with it in the shower.  Actually (and oddly), using shaving cream with it severely irritated my face (like in welts).  Go figure? The only minor glitch was that the first time I popped off the top to clean it, one of the buttons that holds it on, jammed and the top wouldn&#x27;t go back on.  WD-40 to the rescue!</li>
            <li> I had left my first Panasonic shaver at mom&#x27;s house, and began to shave with a disposable twin blade razor--with it, I drew blood twice.  As I prefer donating blood voluntarily, I ordered this shaver.  I like it, simple as that.  My beard/stache growth is short and stubby.  This takes care of it.  I used the previous Panasonic dry, tho I don&#x27;t know why.  With this new one, I decided to shave wet--for me, much safer than using a blade and just as smooth.  So long as I have electricity, the Panasonic wins over the throwaway double blade razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8 hours to recharge poses no problem for me.</li>
            <li> Bought the es-sa40-k since it&#x27;s almost exactly like the older Panasonic model which worked perfectly for six years. I love the flat blade on the back since it&#x27;s so effective on the neck and this is one of the only ones that still has it. Inexpensive shavers are the way to go since you need to replace them every 5 years or so. I&#x27;ve tried a top-of-the-line model and it didn&#x27;t do nearly as good a job on my neck as this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ES-SA40-K works great, holds a good charge. Has a nice wall charger and is easy to clean. Never used it &#x27;wet&#x27; but dry works well. Good shaver for a good price.</li>
            <li> Takes longer to shave with only one head but for the price it does shave smooth and a charge lasts just about a week</li>
            <li> My husband is working on his fourth one of these. he really likes it for the price works well and it fits the hand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying this because I&#x27;ve always had good luck with Panasonic products. Whether this one in particular deserves 4 stars, I have no idea. I&#x27;m replacing a Panasonic shaver given to me 3 years ago as a gift. It worked great until the other day when I dropped it and it quit completely. It cost 3 times as much as this shaver. I wanted to get it repaired. I went online, called Panasonic 800# support, etc, etc... forget it. There is no support for such a \\&quot;personal care\\&quot; item. What&#x27;s more, phone \\&quot;support\\&quot; is an endless loop of aggravating nonsense. And no third party I could find will repair a Panasonic shaver. If you buy such a product, just be aware that if it fails after the warranty period, you gotta buy a new one. Ya takes ya chances. Such is life.</li>
            <li> First let me say the pics posted on this page are not of the shaver that this page is for.   Wet dry shavers are for light water use and in the instructions tell you the proper way to use these with water. I just got this and it cuts nice and close. It doesnt work great with longer hair but it is a great little guy for the price. a good first shaver. Simple to use and cheap.</li>
            <li> This simple shaver works well, especially so wet,  better than my much more expensive, arguably technically superior dry-shave only Braun.   My only slight disappointment is that it takes longer to do a good job than a razor blade, but that said, if I spend the time it seems to shave as close as the outrageously-priced Power Fusion blade, ONE 8-pack of which currently costs ($27.99) more than this machine ($25.99)!   However, shaving is personal, what works for one may not for another.  Razor blades very quickly lose their edge with me, after 2 shaves a Power Fusion blade feels rough, while friends get 6 or more very satisfactory shaves from them</li>
            <li> Strong motor, lots of zooms.  Provides a decent shave with the option to go wet or dry.  Clean up a breeze, and that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> Very good rechargeable shaver used for weekend shaves when a super close blade shave not needed. Trimmer excellent and quality very high. Don&#x27;t expect this to be the equal of a new blade shave but for low cost very good results beyond my expectations. Panasonic quality shows well in the shaver.</li>
            <li> I would not use this as your primary shaver. It works well at trimming but does not give a close shave around the neck.</li>
            <li> Love it but cannot find ability to order another on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I read other online reviews of this product and I had my reservations, but without a big price increase this was the only electric shaver I could afford that would work in the shower.  First the good, the item shipped quickly, was well packaged, and appears stylish.  I had never used a micro-screen shaver before and found it to be easier on my skin than the rotating heads of a Remington shaver.  Even the instructional manual states that it takes a little while getting used to a micro-screen.  Other reviewers have complained about how the recharger cradle for this shaver sits vertically in the power outlet so nothing must be immediately above the plug.  Well in my situation, the problem is even worse.  This is a two prong plug and the weight of shaver causes it to hang away from the wall.  If I slam a door on the same wall as the where this is recharging, then the shaver and charger unit tumbles out of the socket.  In other words the center of gravity of the shaver in the recharger is too high.  This shaver is LOUD, it sends out a high frequency buzz that is most unpleasant.  I would said the noise is approaching that of a dentist&#x27;s drill.  I have only used this in a Dry mode and not when wet, but it does NOT shave.  The only thing worse than enduring the noise from this is that I have leave the thing turned on for a long time to perform even minimal grooming.  I can&#x27;t return this but I will use this when necessary until it breaks while I search for a quieter shaver that works in the shower and can actually trim without cutting.  I won&#x27;t be buying another one.  Update:  After trying it a few times in the shower, I can pretty much conclude it doesn&#x27;t work either wet or dry.</li>
            <li> I had a Panasonic as my next to last razor, and really liked it, couldn&#x27;t replace it at the time (discontinued) and had Braun for 4 or 5 years that eventually slowed down so much new foils and blades didn&#x27;t even help. Plus, the entire time I owned it (it worked fine for most of it&#x27;s life) it was as noisy as a weedeater. I got this razor for Christmas, charged it, turned it on and was so happy about the reduction in noise level it could have produced a lousy shave and I wouldn&#x27;t have cared. Now that I&#x27;ve been using it long enough for it and my face to come to an agreement, I like the closeness of the shave, and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t bog down even if I blow off shaving all weekend. The wet shave option might be a bonus to anyone who wanted to shave in the shower or use a shave cream. I just turn it on and mow my face without the neighbors thinking I&#x27;m running a table saw at 6 in the morning. Great razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, this is still a great razor. But the replacement foils and cutter blades are now MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE RAZOR!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stupid, stupid, stupid. One more thing to research before purchasing. Sheesh.</li>
            <li> This is good for a quick shave/touchup, but it isn&#x27;t great for everyday shaving. I have pretty thick growth, and this left behind longer hairs. I was hoping for a little better. It also gave me a bit of a rash on the bottom of my neck- but I might have been trying too hard to get the neck done(this is where it works the least).  overall- ok.</li>
            <li> It lasted only 10 weeks before it went to shaver heaven. I really don&#x27;t recommend this shaver for daily or even occasional use. Pulls, snags, bites and then breaks.</li>
            <li> I have always been very happy with my previous Panasonic wet/dry shavers, but this one did not indicate that the side trimmer (for sideburns) would work only on sideburns.  The \\&quot;side trimmer\\&quot; didn&#x27;t engage when partially extended to facilitate shaving under the chin as my previous shavers did.  The product description should have indicated this!</li>
            <li> i really love this thing, it cuts the hair good and it doesnt feel like its pulling the hair out like alot of other cheap razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also, i really like the wet/dry feature. You can even use shaving cream with it if you want. my skin is super sensitive and this feels great. also i love the little trimmer thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for about 4 years now, and still love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just stumbled across this listing on Amazon while shopping for something newer, and thought I would leave a review. I bought it on a whim because I got it for about half price and figured what the heck, maybe it would be neat to shave in the shower. However, it quickly became my favorite razor. I had a couple Brauns previously. This thing kicks their tail! Battery lasts forever, and after 4 years I&#x27;m still on my original head and foil.  You read that right.  I used to replace the Braun head and foil about once a year.  Now, I primarily shave with a blade in the shower, and then follow up with this in front of the mirror.  I mention this because perhaps that&#x27;s why I haven&#x27;t had to replace anything on this razor.  The razor works great in the shower too if you prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After an overnight charge, the battery still lasts a month or so with light daily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer does it&#x27;s job, but I don&#x27;t have a beard or mustache, so maybe that&#x27;s why it works fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s sturdy.  For travel, I just throw it in the suitcase.  No protective this or case that.  Stick it in my shoes and that&#x27;s that.  For work, when I know I will have an important meeting late in the day, I can throw this in my briefcase and know I&#x27;m covered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admittedly, the shave is not as close as what I got with the Brauns, but for me this is a fantastic compliment to blade shaving, and the perfect travel and mid-day business razor.  If you buy one, I&#x27;m sure you will enjoy it, and you may find yourself wishing everything was made this well.</li>
            <li> For me, the value/performance is very good for the price. There may be equal or even better shavers for a much higher price, but this is my best experience.  The trimmer is so-so performance, but that&#x27;s of minimal importance to me.  If it&#x27;s important to you (??). The outlet mount charger is better for me, but may not work for others.  All in all I recommend and would buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son who needed a power shaver that would not irritate his face, which is prone to breakouts.  This is a nice model for a teenager to use at the dorms.  It&#x27;s not too expensive, withstands wear and tear, is easy on his skin, and does the job well enough for his needs.  Maybe when he goes out into the professional world he will want and need a higher-end model, but this is perfect for now.</li>
            <li> I got this razor based on the low price and all the positive reviews, but it just doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me. It also hurts my face more than a manual razor would.</li>
            <li> This electric shaver is nice for the price. It provides a decently close shave and you can get it as wet as you like. Battery life is decent too, I&#x27;d say you get about solid 8 minutes of maximum RPM&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beard trimmer is not up to par. I find that it often tugs on my facial hair which is quite uncomfortable. There have been a few times when the shaver has burned my face as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That aside, you aren&#x27;t going to do much better for the price. The Panasonic ES-SA40-K Pro shaver will provide a decently close shave for the fraction of the cost when compared to higher end electric shavers. If you&#x27;re like me and you don&#x27;t always shave every morning and require a beard trimmer, you will definitely want to purchase a separate beard trimmer. I recommend the [[ASIN:B000FED5DU Philips Norelco G370 All-in-1 Grooming System]] if you&#x27;re looking for the full package.</li>
            <li> I saw so many good reviews I decided to take a chance on this shaver. I really like it.  Shaves good either wet or dry, light weight and so far holds a charge well.  Don&#x27;t let the price throw you - this one works better than my triple header ever did, for a lot less money.</li>
            <li> I have tried like 5 different razors and I was about to give up. The last one was a Braun 7 series at $300. I figured it had to be good if it cost $300 bucks right? Well not so fast. I don&#x27;t think I am that hard to please and my beard can&#x27;t be any tougher than most. I always have trouble just under my jaw on my neck, can&#x27;t get a clean shave in less that like 6 or 7 minutes. The Braun did good but I don&#x27;t have 10 minutes each morning to shave! And my beard seemed to grow back heavier and faster, I didn&#x27;t have a 5 oclock shadow, I had 5 oclock black out. I gave it to my son who wants a thicker beard, have at it dude. Back to my old Remington once again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I found these reviews and figured $40, what the heck, worth a shot. At first I was like, OK does about as good as my old Remmy but gave it a week anyway to see if things might improve. Gotta tell you folks, what a difference a week makes. I am down to like 3 or 4 minutes and can&#x27;t believe it is so smooth. Oh and by the way, this is dry saving, not into the foamy stuff much. Like I read on someone elses review, you can hear it cutting the hairs, it is so cool! Love the charger, love the feel of the unit, love it all. Can&#x27;t believe they don&#x27;t charge more for these. 3 baldes, 4 blades, pfffff. This 1 blade unit does the trick, nuff said.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews...but...this razor is wothless...it doesn&#x27;t work if you have more than a minimum soft beard.  When I tried to return it I was told that I could not return a \\&quot;personal item\\&quot; after I opened the package.  Amazon directs the customer to Panasonic so there is no recourse except the garbage bag. Panasonic was a great company when they manufactured in Japan but now they offshore much of their work and the result is often bad.  Do not buy this razor and beware any product that refuses returns.</li>
            <li> Amazing little shaver. Perfect for travel. Holds a charge a long time and cuts through three-day beards.</li>
            <li> Great for the day to day shaving if a razor is too harsh.  Easy to clean!</li>
            <li> I have had this more than a year and still shaving like it&#x27;s supposed to.  The wall-mount charger reduces bathroom counter clutter. Using a duplex to 6 outlet adapter, the charger takes up 2 of the 6 outlets, leaving 4 free.  The trimmer works well too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use it wet the spaces between the blades will load up and it will no longer shave well.  You then have to clean it carefully to recover function.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my teenage nephew, he loved it.  Says it works well no complaints.  Good value was a lot cheaper than others and does the same job</li>
            <li> 20 years ago this was my favorite razor, then it seemed to disappear from the market. It works best as a wet razor provided that you don&#x27;t use thick shaving cream, rather preapply a skin lotion, (I use Eucerin Smooth Repair Dry Skin lotion.)</li>
            <li> This product is a great value:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s good:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holds a charge for many many shaves&lt;br /&gt;compact&lt;br /&gt;easy to hold and use&lt;br /&gt;waterproof... really&lt;br /&gt;good charger system&lt;br /&gt;inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s OK/Not so good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beard trimmer cuts slow and hurts when you speed up.&lt;br /&gt;shaver guard constantly falls off</li>
            <li> I like this product very much except you have to be sure to clean it frequently. For the price it has many good features.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old Panasonic ES4025 when the battery finally died after 4 years.  Pricewise this was close to my old shaver.  It does not shave as close as my old shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use in the shower for my face and other trimming as needed.  First use produced some nasty razor burns on my neck, no way was I going to trim the nuts with this shaver!  Dropped it in the trash on the first day.</li>
            <li> My young boys love this razor I bought two of them, so long as you can get it when on offer for under $26 should last them a few years</li>
            <li> This shaver really does a great job shaving very close to the skin and it seems to run for a very long time before it needs a charge.</li>
            <li> This shaver cuts close without any irritation. Of all the electric  shavers I&#x27;ve tried this is the best one blade. I urge anyone that wants a great shave, this is  one you should buy.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this item, I read numerous reviews here on Amazon. Some reviews claimed that it was great while others seemed to think that it was only so-so. I purchased this shaver because I was tired of having to buy replacement razor-blades that cost a third of this shaver. One of the main complaints was that this product did not provide a close shave and, after using this product for a few weeks, I would have to agree. The shaver is good for a trim but does not provide the close shave that I typically get from a manual razor. This is not to say that I am disappointed with the product but that it does not work as well as I expected.</li>
            <li> it is beautifully built by panasonic and it has never failed to give peak performance even though i have been  using it for several years.G&amp;#62;F&amp;#62;Greene</li>
            <li> I have paid as much as $150.00 for electric shavers in my battle against razor bumps, but this by far the best shaver that I&#x27;ve owned.You cannot beat this product for the price and replacing the blades/ screen is very simple.</li>
            <li> was a gift to my grandson. He enjoys it.</li>
            <li> If you are in a hurry and need an ok shaver... this is the one.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing fancy and not a close shave.  Battery life is ok.</li>
            <li> Only have one comment....AWESOME! Every time I shave I wish I would have replaced my old one a long time before.</li>
            <li> This looked like a great idea - and some things really work:  the shape is nice, the recharger is nice, battery life is good after a year&#x27;s use.  But I&#x27;m unimpressed with the closeness - it shaves OK, but not as good as other electric dual-head shavers.  I probably will chose something else when it comes time to replace it.</li>
            <li> Not quite as powerful but does the job,</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this razor. I have a mustache, and this shaves and trims accurately and closely. I like it also because it DOESN&#x27;T have the awkward, wobbly head, which is so prevalent in many more expensive razors. Clean, close, inexpensive, and seems to last forever. I&#x27;ve had it over a year and still haven&#x27;t had to replace the foil yet! GREAT RAZOR!!</li>
            <li> Bought this razor for my sons who are in High School.  They like it, and it seems to hold a charge for a long time.  Definitely recommend this razor to anyone.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shaver.  It operates in both wet/dry conditions, and always produces a very clean and close shave, and for me ALWAYS without any razor burn.  It can be cleaned in 30 seconds with a tiny bit of soap and hot water, recharges on a base station quickly, and has an edging slide up blade perfect for finishing touches.  I recommend this already to all of the guy friends I have who complain about using stick razors.  Combine it with the iStubble and you are Styling!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t really do the job.</li>
            <li> The razor was great until I put a small dent in the foil screen, now it was to cut skin or rip hair.  I need to find a new screen!</li>
            <li> I get this item because of high rating and the golden name of Panasonic but I had it for 3 months now and it never give smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;every time I use it I get skin irritation, bleed and never gave close shaving leaving complete areas of hair !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;maybe I should get the 3 blades model :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line NOT Recommended.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a low cost shaver, this one it&#x27;s perfect. Simple, without many useless features. Does the same job as the expensive shavers.</li>
            <li> I have been buying panasonic shavers for a number of years now ranging from $40 to over $100, double blade, triple blade etc. I never normally expected a clean shave so I always used a razor to finish off so this time time around I decided to go for the cheapest one and I am pleasantly surprised. I think most people are dissapointed because they expect a $30 shaver to give them a shave normally expected from one well over $100. Nevertheless this $30 shaver gives me a very clean shave. I could hardly find any any hair to remove using the razor afterwards. The battery last a very long time too. Very Very pleased. Well worth the money I paid for it.</li>
            <li> This is better than razors that cost twice as much. I had a 4 head microscreen that did not do as good a job.</li>
            <li> Battery lasts forever.  Easy to clean.  The motor doesn&#x27;t seem to wind down in power even after multiple uses without recharging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charger is a bit strange, but I suppose its a safety thing since its wet/dry.</li>
