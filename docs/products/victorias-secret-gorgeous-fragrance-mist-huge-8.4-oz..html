    <ol>
            <li>SHE FEELS VERY HAPPY WHIT</li>
            <li>So I think it is very pleasant and not like those perfumes that deter people and make them sneeze or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Happy Happy Happy!</li>
            <li>great scent</li>
            <li>All in all, it is a great purchase</li>
            <li>I am mostly happy just to have this scent since VS quit carrying it.</li>
            <li>My favorite mist!</li>
            <li>I thought it smelled amazing when she let me wear some for a dance I attended.</li>
            <li>It is probably nice to wear out to a movie, to dinner, a dance, some event that you&#x27;re not stuck at for too long.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it smells really nice</li>
            <li>I recommend placing this in the fridge as this is more of a spring or summer fragrance &amp; will feel great when you spray it on yourself while it&#x27;s hot out</li>
            <li>so I am glad I was able to find it here.  </li>
            <li>and you should consider buying it if you&#x27;re looking for a sexy scent.</li>
            <li>AND SHE LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>This perfume is perfectly lovely.</li>
            <li>It is feminine, sexy, fruity, and flowery.</li>
            <li>LOVE the spray :)</li>
            <li>It was a good price and it did ship very fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great news is that original price is $25, so buying it from Amazon is a steal!</li>
            <li>my boyfriend hasn&#x27;t had a chance to smell it and give his opinion on it yet, but I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;ll thoroughly enjoy it.</li>
            <li>It does scratch easily though</li>
            <li>this body mist is one of my favorites it doesnt have that strong of a smell</li>
            <li>I was super exited to find it online, because VS doesn&#x27;t sell it anymore!</li>
            <li>She will continue to purchase as log as it is available.</li>
            <li>A light floral scent.</li>
            <li>It is also lightly fragranced, which is something I always look for in a perfume.</li>
            <li>but when I got it, I was super excited to see that it was the real deal!!!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my order it was shipper super fast and was delivered just as fast!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clean and sweet, not overpowering</li>
            <li>Very light, but smells AMAZING and lasts a long time!</li>
            <li>She has her own bottle, that has lasted her quite a while, and uses it frequently.</li>
            <li>Luckily, perfume dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>First off this perfume is a Must have!</li>
            <li>For some reason, instead of spraying a mist of the fragrance, it sprays more of a direct stream.</li>
            <li>That has been my go-to scent for a while, but this one might be tied for first.</li>
            <li>This was the exact product I wanted in every aspect except for the spray nozzle.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I love it!</li>
            <li>i absolutely love this smell, but it only lasts minutes.</li>
            <li>At first I was thinking it might be a knock off</li>
            <li>Its not too strong and not too lite, you are able to smell it while not overwhelming the noses of others.</li>
            <li>i am very upset with the quality/length of the smell</li>
            <li>I was very statisfied with the purchse.</li>
            <li>Given as a greatly appreciated gift.</li>
            <li>She even writes a little thank you with the order: too cute \\&quot;)</li>
            <li>I thought this was a brand new bottle.  </li>
            <li>This is the bigger bottle and for half the cost, got to love that.</li>
            <li>IT IS VEEEERY SOFTLY.</li>
            <li>It looked old and used.  </li>
            <li>But I think it is a pretty bottle you can leave out on your makeup counter, with its pink sleek rectangular bottle and gem-like cap with \\&quot;gold\\&quot; accents.</li>

            <li> great scent, my hubby loves it!!</li>
            <li> Bottle was scratched.  There was no plastic covering or shrink wrap to protect it.  It looks &amp;#34;used&amp;#34;.  Very disappointed as this is a gift.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this spray! But, this product is discontinued at Victoria Secrets so I am glad I was able to find it here.  She will continue to purchase as log as it is available. Happy Happy Happy!</li>
            <li> First off this perfume is a Must have! Its not too strong and not too lite, you are able to smell it while not overwhelming the noses of others.

            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this a little over a year now however I can no longer find it at the store. This is the bigger bottle and for half the cost, got to love that.</li>
            <li> bottle scratched very used, name rubed off, sent very faint, like the product is old or watered down. It was a good price and it did ship very fast. Thank You.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t go to Victoria&#x27;s Secret a lot, so I actually heard about this perfume from my roommate. She has her own bottle, that has lasted her quite a while, and uses it frequently. I thought it smelled amazing when she let me wear some for a dance I attended. It&#x27;s clean and sweet, not overpowering and-- I don&#x27;t know how to explain it but-- I just feel sexy-smelling! I just got it, so my boyfriend hasn&#x27;t had a chance to smell it and give his opinion on it yet, but I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;ll thoroughly enjoy it. We like my Warm &amp; Cozy perfume from Victoria&#x27;s Secret. That has been my go-to scent for a while, but this one might be tied for first. Even my mother likes the smell and complimented me on it today. So I think it is very pleasant and not like those perfumes that deter people and make them sneeze or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great news is that original price is $25, so buying it from Amazon is a steal! Downside is that I don&#x27;t think the scent lasts very long. It wore off in less than an hour? Unless you dig your nose in your scarf or shirt, where ever you might have sprayed it, the smell will disappear. That being said, I don&#x27;t recommend it for long-wear use like to work or school... unless you want to reapply every so often. It is probably nice to wear out to a movie, to dinner, a dance, some event that you&#x27;re not stuck at for too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is simple yet fancy enough and is made of plastic so there are no worries about shattering the bottle if you drop it. It does scratch easily though and that was how it came shipped to me! But I think it is a pretty bottle you can leave out on your makeup counter, with its pink sleek rectangular bottle and gem-like cap with \\&quot;gold\\&quot; accents. All in all, it is a great purchase and you should consider buying it if you&#x27;re looking for a sexy scent.</li>
            <li> A light floral scent.I recommend placing this in the fridge as this is more of a spring or summer fragrance &amp; will feel great when you spray it on yourself while it&#x27;s hot out</li>
            <li> This was the exact product I wanted in every aspect except for the spray nozzle. For some reason, instead of spraying a mist of the fragrance, it sprays more of a direct stream. This isn&#x27;t much of a problem about 5 minutes after I spray some on myself, but it initially leaves round, wet spots on my clothes. I&#x27;ve tried holding the bottle as far from my body as my arms would allow, but I still get wet spots. Luckily, perfume dissipates quickly. Other than that, I love it! I am mostly happy just to have this scent since VS quit carrying it. I&#x27;ve though about just switching the nozzle with another bottle of perfume once one is empty since that is the only issue I have with it.</li>
            <li> i absolutely love this smell, but it only lasts minutes. I dont know if it is suppose to last only that long or it may be fake and mixed with mostly water i am very upset with the quality/length of the smell</li>
            <li> I was very statisfied with the purchse. It smells grest, not too over powering. My next purchse wil be the purfume.</li>
            <li> Given as a greatly appreciated gift.</li>
            <li> Y BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FOR MY WIFE AND SHE LOVE IT. SHE FEELS VERY HAPPY WHIT THIS FRANGANCE IT IS VEEEERY SOFTLY. I RECOMEND THIS ITEM IT CAME TO MY HOUSE ON TIME.</li>
            <li> Bottle not in any packaging or shrinkwrap. Liquid missing from bottle. Definitely was used. Was supposed to be a gift.</li>
            <li> My favorite mist! Very light, but smells AMAZING and lasts a long time! I was super exited to find it online, because VS doesn&#x27;t sell it anymore! I would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> This perfume is perfectly lovely. It is feminine, sexy, fruity, and flowery. It is also lightly fragranced, which is something I always look for in a perfume.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a brand new bottle.  It looked old and used.  Not happy and will not use this vendor again!</li>
            <li> this body mist is one of my favorites it doesnt have that strong of a smell but you can smell it, it smells really nice</li>
            <li> At first I was thinking it might be a knock off but when I got it, I was super excited to see that it was the real deal!!! LOVE the spray :)</li>
