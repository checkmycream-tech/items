            <li>I love the fact this eye sunscreen doesn&#x27;t sting like regular sunscreen does around the eyes, it is also not grease and smells nice, However I think it is a bit pricey.</li>
            <li>My skins absorb it quickly, and it&#x27;s not greasy at all</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>but it goes on quickly.</li>

            <li>but I found it leaves some white residue on my skin and may not be a good fit for someone darker than very pale</li>
            <li>I use it on my whole face.</li>

            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to know that it doesn&#x27;t irritate the eyes at all!</li>
            <li>I live in a very hot and humid climate, so even when my face is beaded with perspiration, and the sweat is gliding down my face like Niagra Falls, the sunblock doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes.</li>

            <li> My wife needed this because her eyelids were sensitive to sun exposure.  After quite a bit of research, this was the only one I could find that promised to cause no irritation of the eye once applied.    My wife approves - FIVE STARS.    Recommended!</li>
            <li> Must have for any sunscreen freak like me. Highest SPF I could find in a quality affordable eye cream.Fast absorbing,moisturizing,great under makeup,unscented and leaves no visible white residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are few other SPF 30 or close eye creams I tried:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Denese SPF 30 Defense Eye Cream&lt;br /&gt;and&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena Healthy Defense Daily Eye Cream SPF 30&lt;br /&gt;are both tinted that I do not mind, but also both of them after couple weeks use changed consistency from smooth cream to chunky goop and ended up in a trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lancome Bienfait Multi-Vital Eye SPF 28&lt;br /&gt;is OK but I found it leaves some white residue on my skin and may not be a good fit for someone darker than very pale complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHISEIDO SUN PROTECTION EYE CREME SUNSCREEN spf 32 PA++&lt;br /&gt;is a great cream but at $30 for 0.5 oz. it is more money for less product.</li>
            <li> Bought this item a few weeks ago and been using it everyday. It&#x27;s not too greasy and didn&#x27;t cause and uncomfortable to my skin. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> Wrong merchandise!!&lt;br /&gt;I ordered eye-cream but received something different.  Very disappointed!!</li>
            <li> I&amp;#34;ve been searching for great eye protection and I&#x27;ve found it.  THis doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes at all!  NOw I feel like my delicate eye area is protected as well as the rest of me.</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen for my sensitive eyes. It rubs on a little creamy but will absorb in quickly!!! Love all of Clarins sunscreen products. This is great for sensitive and acne prone skin!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try!!!</li>
            <li> Best eye sunscreen around! Goes great under concealer or looks good alone. Non irritating and doesn&#x27;t burn the sensitive skin around your eyes. My favorite stuff!</li>
            <li> I love the fact this eye sunscreen doesn&#x27;t sting like regular sunscreen does around the eyes, it is also not grease and smells nice, However I think it is a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> Best eye cream ever!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased it for my eyes protection under the sun during water sports.  I have used it few times, and i like it a lot.  My skins absorb it quickly, and it&#x27;s not greasy at all even it has SPF30.  During summer, i think i will use it under the foundation as well.</li>
            <li> goes on smoothly. no greasy feel. Can apply makeup immediately over it. I deducted one star because there is no expiration date.</li>
            <li> Not so good did nothing for wrinkles or bags under eyes !!!!</li>
            <li> Have used it for years because it&#x27;s the only sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t make my eyes sting.  I use it on my whole face.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen for the delicate eye area. Any other I have used breaks me out.</li>
            <li> Wow I just tried this and it is so smooth and not irritating to  my delicate eye skin. I have loved many Clarins products and really am happy to have found this at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Eye cream with SPF....what a relief ladies!!&lt;br /&gt;Buy it and enjoy it, four seasons of a year...we can&#x27;t stop aging, we can slow it down, by using good products, 365 days of a year.&lt;br /&gt;And this is a totally amazing product.  I had tried K...&#x27;s, it didn&#x27;t work (their nice sales manager at Nordstrom helped me to do the return).&lt;br /&gt;This works!  Yay~!</li>
            <li> Love it but a bit greasy looking</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly. Not shiny. Doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes. Great product for my sensitive skin. Love SPF 30. Use it everyday. A lot less expensive than prior product I used. Bought 7 tubes for a big saving. Gave 2 to my sister. She loves it as well.</li>
            <li> I have an olive skin tone and have been wearing sunblock since my late-teens (I&#x27;m a thirty-year-old woman today). I used to wear American sunblocks, but after a thorough research, I&#x27;ve discovered that European sunblocks are more superior in its protection. The American products aren&#x27;t as photo-stable and degrade in the sun as opposed to its European counterparts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I began searching for the right product that gives maximum protection without irritating my eyes and skin (I have very sensitive eyes and skin). I&#x27;ve tried Murad&#x27;s sunblock (even though it is an American product) for the eyes and upon its application, my eyes began to sting and water excessively. After a few trial and errors, I came across Clarins sunblock for the eyes. I was pleasantly surprised to know that it doesn&#x27;t irritate the eyes at all! I apply it before going swimming, and yet I haven&#x27;t experienced any irritation. I live in a very hot and humid climate, so even when my face is beaded with perspiration, and the sweat is gliding down my face like Niagra Falls, the sunblock doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes. This product doesn&#x27;t reverse any existing wrinkles, but it can potentially prevent your skin from aging prematurely. It glides smoothly on your skin upon its application. It is absorbent and meshes well with concealer/eye makeup. Even though the tube is small, it goes a long way. If you&#x27;re looking for a product that gives great protection against the UVA and UVB rays, then I recommend this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Important note: the SPF protects against the UVB rays and not the UVA rays. Many people have a common misconception that the SPF protects against the UVA rays (which is responsible for skin-aging).  When shopping for sunscreens, please check to see if the sunblock offers broad-spectrum protection and is photo-stable. The PPD (which stands for Persistent Pigment Darkening) is responsible for the UVA rays.</li>
            <li> This cream works well as a sunscreen for the delicate skin around the eyes. I had been using Neutrogena&#x27;s version most recently, and have tried multiple other brands over years, but these always caused eye discomfort &amp; irritation, especially if I sweated while outside. Not Clarins, thankfully! Plus, it has a higher SPF than other versions I&#x27;ve tried, so this cream has better protection for the area around the eyes. I use a small amount, enough to cover the area but not leave excess, and haven&#x27;t had issues with shininess; it absorbs well enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for other reviewers who expected it to do more than advertised, like take care of wrinkles or dark circles -- that is not what it is designed for, but by protecting the skin surrounding eyes from sun damage, it will prevent further wrinkles over time. I spent more on this eye cream than any other brand before, but it was worth it -- highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> I started out just using it under my eyes but started using it for my face too. It looks white coming out of the tube but it goes on quickly. It&#x27;s lightweight and it vanishes when applied. I have light to med skin tone. It may be more noticeable with the darker skin tones but it works well for mine.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent performance, superior product quality, giving a sense of comfort when using bright eye-catching package design.Very good</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen for the eye area.  I use for running and haven&#x27;t had any problems with eye irritation.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;ve never been allergic to any eye lotion/cream/etc. i don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to find an eye cream with such a high SPF, that does not irritate the eyes. I applied it all around my eyes, and never felt any stinging. The only downfall is this product does contain parabens. I doubt I will be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> I like Clarins&#x27; products, but this cream is not good for my eyes.</li>
    </ol>
