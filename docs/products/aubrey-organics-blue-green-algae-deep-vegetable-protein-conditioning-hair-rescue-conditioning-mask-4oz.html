            <li>(I don&#x27;t mind paying more for good product that works for my hair.</li>
            <li>Aubrey Organics makes a glycerin protein conditioner that is just as good but at a way better value.  </li>
            <li>I really liked this mask.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy and am trucking along on my transitioning journey with this new discovery!!!!</li>
            <li>Love this product - why more people don&#x27;t buy this is a mystery to me!  </li>
            <li>Purchased it after reading reviews -- supposedly this is really great for curly hair and makes a visible difference after the very first use.  </li>
            <li>It is the best mask I&#x27;ve used SO FAR.  </li>
            <li>WOW this stuff is great &amp; it works fantastically!!</li>
            <li>I am a true product junkie (PJ), but this is a keeper and will significantly decrease my search for products that are organic and that  work!!!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s the next best thing to making your own cleansing and conditioning product/</li>
            <li>on a plus side it is easy to wash off, smells nice.</li>
            <li>I love love love Aubrey products and use the conditioners and shampoos faithfully.  </li>
            <li>and it worked like magic.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I am now confident that this product will keep my hair from breaking</li>
            <li>This is the best deep conditioner I have ever used.</li>
            <li>but my hair aren&#x27;t damaged, maybe it would work better for somebody else.</li>
            <li>cinnamon and honey homemade mask works a lot better for me or even coconut oil mask.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this stuff.</li>
            <li>If you want to use it more than once a month it will add up (granted</li>
            <li>+ Aubrey GPB combo exclusively for DT, which I still love,</li>
            <li>Natu Shampoos &amp; Conditioners (safe for color treated</li>
            <li>I love Aubrey&#x27;s product line.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I have better results with my homemade hair masks,but if you don&#x27;t have the time to do the &amp;#34;homemade&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>FYI be sure to use a hydrating mask after any protein treatment.</li>
            <li>I too am a fan of Aubrey Organics &amp; use just about most of their shampoos &amp; conditioners.</li>
            <li>(I use their BGA Protein + Shampoo &amp; I love this shampoo too).</li>
            <li>It does work though and it has an interesting smell, reminds me of maple and brown sugar oatmeal.</li>
            <li>It was just okay.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>The most I can do for the damaged hair is wait for it to grow out.  </li>
            <li>(what more could you ask for).</li>
            <li>I normally use Aphogee protein treatments to take care of my breakage, but decided to take a break from it and bought this item because I heard so many great things about it.</li>
            <li>My hair looks great; soft &amp; shiny, after I used the mask.</li>
            <li>I will say, oddly, I really like the texture of this stuff - slimy IN A GOOD WAY?</li>
            <li>This mask made this weeks take-downs easy.</li>
            <li>Afterwards my hair feels manageable and strong.</li>
            <li>The only con about this product is that its only good for 2 uses &amp; it would be awesome if I could use it every 2 weeks</li>
            <li>I have fine, wavy/curly hair, prone to frizz, and this gave me a the moisture and frizz control</li>
            <li>Huge fan of Aubrey Organics products.</li>
            <li>Huge amounts of breakage and my hair looked like straw.  </li>
            <li>go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High marks to yet another fantastic Aubrey Organics</li>
            <li>go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High marks to yet another fantastic Aubrey Organics</li>
            <li>It is pricey (which is way I make the jar last awhile lol)</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s amazing, really</li>
            <li>I like this hairconditioner very much, makes a difference for sure.</li>
            <li>All I can say is Aubrey Organics conditioners (original 2001 formulas)</li>
            <li>I like to add my hair oils first and then layer this on top and let it sit in my hair.</li>
            <li>But since I love what it does, love that it is all natural, I will buy it again.</li>
            <li>Amazing product, makes my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>are getting really stingy with their (better) products.</li>
            <li>, it is worth every penny)--You really should get more product for</li>
            <li>wow!!!!!  </li>
            <li>Although it is pricey, it&#x27;s worth the money if you want to pamper your hair with more natural products.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price, and</li>
            <li>The next day my hair is always so much softer, thicker &amp; fuller, it just keeps getting better &amp; better.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it if you have thin/fine/damaged hair.</li>
            <li>and then there was enough for one more light coverage use.</li>
            <li>It is just so soft and healthy looking (</li>
            <li>well on its own or layered over other ingredients for super rich DT&lt;br /&gt;(as in with honey, olive oil,</li>
            <li>I also have an issue with products weighing my hair down and making it greasy - this product is perfect if you have the same issues!</li>
            <li>your hair is dry, damaged, chemically treated, straight, natural or somewhere in between, if you are looking for a great conditioning product that will leave you with super soft hair, then, Aubrey&#x27;s Blue-Green Algae Conditioning Mask is for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its really moisturizing and leaves hair feeling soft but strong.</li>
            <li>This past year I decided to invest in some hair thickening products, as well as masks to help my hair get strong and healthy again.</li>
            <li>Will keep buying it for sure, it is hard to find it in the stores, so thanks for amazon. :-)</li>
            <li>You need quite a lot because you put it on dry hair, but it is healthy for your hair, no chemicals.</li>
            <li>Also, I died my hair super blue black, bleached sections and applied ultra violet dye to the bleached sections, so I guess you could say my hair is fairly processed.    </li>
            <li>I have thin, fine relaxed hair &amp; when I use these products they always make my hair SO full &amp; thick afterwards, I love it!!!</li>
            <li>, it reminds me a little of GPB, (I was using warm honey</li>
            <li>It is  hard to use it as I am accustomed to use a product more freely instead of sparingly.</li>
            <li>Aubrey Organic Blue Green Algae Hair Mask in my opinion made a great deal of difference in the health of my hair.  </li>
            <li>It really strenghtened my hair.</li>
            <li>Great if you don&#x27;t like the after-shampoo deep conditioners that make you have to wait 15 minutes only to have to go back into the shower to rinse it off if you don&#x27;t like bending over the sink.</li>
            <li>Smell you have to get used too, do not like it that much.</li>
            <li>Thanks Aubrey for making such a fabulous product, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m putting on too much</li>
            <li>Not only did it look healthy after a treatment, but my hair was so soft.  </li>
            <li>I use it as a protein deep conditioner for my fine, highly porous 4a/b hair.  </li>
            <li>your hair is oily or very fine, apply it to damp hair (layered over a little aloe vera) and shampoo out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to say, it DOES make my hair nice and soft and a little stronger.</li>
            <li>I like to use this stuff because it&#x27;s a deep conditioning alternative that isn&#x27;t super oily, so you don&#x27;t have to risk having greasy hair after one wash or stripped hair after 2.</li>
            <li>I have high expectations when it comes to a hair mask.  </li>
            <li>I like this product because it made my hair feel very soft after using it, but I won&#x27;t be buying it again because I personally can&#x27;t afford this price for something that runs out so quickly.</li>
            <li>your hair is very dry, damaged or chemically treated, cleanse hair first and layer it over olive oil for a super intense Deep Treatment and warm-water rinse OR</li>
            <li>I found the Aubrey Organics - Blue Green Algae Hair Mask, okay; it did not do any more for my hair than other hair masks I have used, I do recommend, however, that this review does not deter you from trying it, I believe in Aubrey Organics products .....</li>
            <li>My hair was so silky soft after and noticeably thicker as I ran my fingers through it!</li>
            <li>Natural Way</li>
            <li>I look product and it soft my hair as soon as I placed on hair.i</li>
            <li>was and still is so soft.  </li>
            <li>about 6 months post relaxer  and am transitioning  to natural and</li>
            <li>Made my 4C hair soft &amp; easier to comb.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell good and too expensive for the amount you get.</li>
            <li>I applied this stuff to my hair, put a shower cap on, and then I wrapped my head in a hot wet towel.</li>
            <li>but I think I have a new alternate for switching up products!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ethnically mixed (Japanese, Native American and Mexican) and it really didn&#x27;t do that much for my hair.</li>
            <li>The only negative is that you if you have longer hair, you will use most if not all of it in one</li>
            <li>The only negative is that you if you have longer hair, you will use most if not all of it in one</li>
            <li>Used it once and left my hair very soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>Only thing is that with my long (middle of my back) hair I go through it really quick.</li>
            <li>and I think you will like it a lot for general use.&lt;br /&gt;In color and appearance</li>
            <li>applied half the jar to my long, fine hair and left it overnight (at the suggestion of another commenter).  </li>
            <li>I would most certainly recommend this to anybody wit thin, dry, flat hair.</li>
            <li>My locks came out moisturized and the loose hair near my scalp was really soft.</li>
            <li>Only gave it four stars as the jar is tiny for the price and being a natural with a head full of thick hair</li>
            <li>Am barely getting a second treatment out of the jar.   </li>
    </ol>

            <li> your hair is dry, damaged, chemically treated, straight, natural or somewhere in between, if you are looking for a great conditioning product that will leave you with super soft hair, then, Aubrey&#x27;s Blue-Green Algae Conditioning Mask is for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its really moisturizing and leaves hair feeling soft but strong.</li>
            <li> This past year I decided to invest in some hair thickening products, as well as masks to help my hair get strong and healthy again.</li>
            <li> Will keep buying it for sure, it is hard to find it in the stores, so thanks for amazon. :-)</li>
            <li> You need quite a lot because you put it on dry hair, but it is healthy for your hair, no chemicals.</li>
            <li> Also, I died my hair super blue black, bleached sections and applied ultra violet dye to the bleached sections, so I guess you could say my hair is fairly processed.    </li>
            <li> I have thin, fine relaxed hair &amp; when I use these products they always make my hair SO full &amp; thick afterwards, I love it!!!</li>
            <li> , it reminds me a little of GPB, (I was using warm honey</li>
            <li> It is  hard to use it as I am accustomed to use a product more freely instead of sparingly.</li>
            <li> Aubrey Organic Blue Green Algae Hair Mask in my opinion made a great deal of difference in the health of my hair.  </li>
            <li> It really strenghtened my hair.</li>
            <li> Great if you don&#x27;t like the after-shampoo deep conditioners that make you have to wait 15 minutes only to have to go back into the shower to rinse it off if you don&#x27;t like bending over the sink.</li>
            <li> Smell you have to get used too, do not like it that much.</li>
            <li> Thanks Aubrey for making such a fabulous product, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m putting on too much</li>
            <li> Not only did it look healthy after a treatment, but my hair was so soft.  </li>
            <li> I use it as a protein deep conditioner for my fine, highly porous 4a/b hair.  </li>
            <li> your hair is oily or very fine, apply it to damp hair (layered over a little aloe vera) and shampoo out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to say, it DOES make my hair nice and soft and a little stronger.</li>
            <li> I like to use this stuff because it&#x27;s a deep conditioning alternative that isn&#x27;t super oily, so you don&#x27;t have to risk having greasy hair after one wash or stripped hair after 2.</li>
            <li> I have high expectations when it comes to a hair mask.  </li>
            <li> I like this product because it made my hair feel very soft after using it, but I won&#x27;t be buying it again because I personally can&#x27;t afford this price for something that runs out so quickly.</li>
            <li> your hair is very dry, damaged or chemically treated, cleanse hair first and layer it over olive oil for a super intense Deep Treatment and warm-water rinse OR</li>
            <li> I found the Aubrey Organics - Blue Green Algae Hair Mask, okay; it did not do any more for my hair than other hair masks I have used, I do recommend, however, that this review does not deter you from trying it, I believe in Aubrey Organics products .....</li>
            <li> My hair was so silky soft after and noticeably thicker as I ran my fingers through it!</li>
            <li> Natural Way</li>
            <li> I look product and it soft my hair as soon as I placed on hair.i</li>
            <li> was and still is so soft.  </li>
            <li> about 6 months post relaxer  and am transitioning  to natural and</li>
            <li> Made my 4C hair soft &amp; easier to comb.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell good and too expensive for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> I applied this stuff to my hair, put a shower cap on, and then I wrapped my head in a hot wet towel.</li>
            <li> but I think I have a new alternate for switching up products!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ethnically mixed (Japanese, Native American and Mexican) and it really didn&#x27;t do that much for my hair.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that you if you have longer hair, you will use most if not all of it in one</li>
            <li> The only negative is that you if you have longer hair, you will use most if not all of it in one</li>
            <li> Used it once and left my hair very soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> Only thing is that with my long (middle of my back) hair I go through it really quick.</li>
            <li> and I think you will like it a lot for general use.&lt;br /&gt;In color and appearance</li>
            <li> applied half the jar to my long, fine hair and left it overnight (at the suggestion of another commenter).  </li>
            <li> I would most certainly recommend this to anybody wit thin, dry, flat hair.</li>
            <li> My locks came out moisturized and the loose hair near my scalp was really soft.</li>
            <li> Only gave it four stars as the jar is tiny for the price and being a natural with a head full of thick hair</li>
            <li> Am barely getting a second treatment out of the jar.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other similar products before and could see at least some effect, some products lasted longer or wore out quickly -- but this mask didn&#x27;t do anything at all.  </li>
            <li> so i can keep my long hair and stop having to grow it back all the time.</li>
            <li> I usually deep condition with this mask on dry hair &amp; leave it on overnight.</li>
            <li> I used it 2 days ago following the directions on the jar, and didn&#x27;t see any improvement at all -- my hair is as dry as always.  </li>
            <li> I put the product into my dry hair, work it through before bed, wrap it and wash it out the next morning.  </li>
            <li> I am not really sure if I have scab hair within my 4b, but after trying all kinds of items and remedies, these three products definitely and noticeably softened my new growth and relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> but I will only use only when hair is really dry (will use other deep conditioners in between times)</li>
            <li> I also try some of the skin care products and I read the reviews hoping that this would do the trick for my very coarse, thick, dry natural African American hair, but it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> My hair was really long</li>
            <li> First off, it smells pretty awful, but I was willing to overlook this for potential improvement to the body of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not impressed but not bad...</li>
            <li> One just puts it on starting at the scalp and massaging down to the ends and keeps it on for fifteen minutes before rinsing.  </li>
            <li> tried it on dry hair, on wet hair, walked around with it for 2 hours and nothing.</li>
            <li> have very dry hair 4a/b type of curly hair.</li>
            <li> The smell went away after washing, but the results were minimal.  </li>
            <li> It is slightly expensive but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> However my hair is long and down to my waist</li>
            <li> The jar lasts me awhile because I don&#x27;t use a lot (a little goes a long way for me).</li>
            <li> This product only lasted for 2 uses and my hair is about two inches past my shoulders.</li>
            <li> I ended up using this other stuff I picked up from CVS for about 6$</li>
            <li> 4 years of dying my hair pink, purple, blue AND bleaching it only made the problem worse.</li>
            <li> The smell was different, not very pleasant.</li>
            <li> This product is so affordable, the only negative aspect is the amount you are getting.</li>
            <li> No grease, and weighed down hair.</li>
            <li> My hair condition is some dryness on the ends, slightly wavy, and medium thickness.</li>
            <li> I use it weekly and it softens and thickens my hair after putting it on before shampooing for 15 minutes to half an hour.</li>
            <li> Also noticed less shedding when combing.</li>
            <li> I have thick long hair so it provided one heavy coverage</li>
            <li> Green People Organics</li>
            <li> ; on the mind body green website, so I thought I would give it a try.&lt;br</li>
            <li> product was a waste of time and money for me.  </li>
            <li> I keep my hair in small braids which I take down 3 or 4 times weekly.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thin, about two inches past my shoulders, and it only lasted about 3 treatments.</li>
            <li> In the morning I shampooed and blow dried as usual, but did not see or feel any improvement in my hair all.  </li>
            <li> I got 4-5 treatments and my hair is fairly long but thin.  </li>
            <li> not sure what i benefited from this product</li>
            <li> Unbelievable results</li>
            <li> I have very thin, FLAT hair.</li>
            <li> This product looked and smelled weird and by weird I am trying to be polite by not saying gross, but that doesn&#x27;t deter me from using anything.  </li>
            <li> Plus I had to use half of a jar in just one application for shoulder-length curly hair... too expensive for the quantity and no effect.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li> Not too crazy about this.</li>

            <li> This product looked and smelled weird and by weird I am trying to be polite by not saying gross, but that doesn&#x27;t deter me from using anything.  I tried the product on 3 occasions.  I have a lot of hair and the product was only 4oz.  I wasn&#x27;t impressed at all.  I love love love Aubrey products and use the conditioners and shampoos faithfully.  I also try some of the skin care products and I read the reviews hoping that this would do the trick for my very coarse, thick, dry natural African American hair, but it didn&#x27;t.  The smell went away after washing, but the results were minimal.  My hair wasn&#x27;t any softer or shinier than with anything else I have ever used including olive oil.</li>
            <li> I found the Aubrey Organics - Blue Green Algae Hair Mask, okay; it did not do any more for my hair than other hair masks I have used, I do recommend, however, that this review does not deter you from trying it, I believe in Aubrey Organics products .....</li>
            <li> I like this hairconditioner very much, makes a difference for sure. You need quite a lot because you put it on dry hair, but it is healthy for your hair, no chemicals. Will keep buying it for sure, it is hard to find it in the stores, so thanks for amazon. :-)</li>
            <li> This product only lasted for 2 uses and my hair is about two inches past my shoulders. I&#x27;m ethnically mixed (Japanese, Native American and Mexican) and it really didn&#x27;t do that much for my hair. My hair condition is some dryness on the ends, slightly wavy, and medium thickness. Also, I died my hair super blue black, bleached sections and applied ultra violet dye to the bleached sections, so I guess you could say my hair is fairly processed.    I applied this stuff to my hair, put a shower cap on, and then I wrapped my head in a hot wet towel. This stuff did almost nothing. I noticed no change at all, but it did grease the heck out of my scalp. I ended up using this other stuff I picked up from CVS for about 6$ and it worked like magic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff on and off for years. It&#x27;s amazing and strengthens hair. Ideally using it every 1-2 weeks will yield the best results.</li>
            <li> This works!! However my hair is long and down to my waist and I only got 2 uses out of it.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, makes my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> I am not going to make pretenses, I am a fan of the entire Aubrey Organics line through and through.  This is an exceptional product of theirs.  One just puts it on starting at the scalp and massaging down to the ends and keeps it on for fifteen minutes before rinsing.  The results are visible the very next day.  And what results are there!  My hair is immediately thicker and fuller and healthier.  It definitely helps with the split ends. I fully recommend.</li>
            <li> My hair was really long but it broke off. My hair does grow but i have a problem with breakage.It really strenghtened my hair. I love this stuff. I am now confident that this product will keep my hair from breaking so i can keep my long hair and stop having to grow it back all the time. I have ethnic hair so it works well for all hair types.  It will be forever in my routine.</li>
            <li> Been using for years. Always revitalizes my hair! Great if you don&#x27;t like the after-shampoo deep conditioners that make you have to wait 15 minutes only to have to go back into the shower to rinse it off if you don&#x27;t like bending over the sink.</li>
            <li> I normally use Aphogee protein treatments to take care of my breakage, but decided to take a break from it and bought this item because I heard so many great things about it. I have to say, it DOES make my hair nice and soft and a little stronger. I may have to use this with their shampoo and conditioner to get the best of both worlds, though.</li>
            <li> This is the best deep conditioner I have ever used. It strengthens the hair beautifully and doesn&#x27;t drip. Although it is pricey, it&#x27;s worth the money if you want to pamper your hair with more natural products.</li>
            <li> Does wonders for my hair. Brings my hair back to life. This is one of my staple products my Aubrey Organics!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t notice ANY difference. tried it on dry hair, on wet hair, walked around with it for 2 hours and nothing. but my hair aren&#x27;t damaged, maybe it would work better for somebody else. cinnamon and honey homemade mask works a lot better for me or even coconut oil mask. on a plus side it is easy to wash off, smells nice.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this stuff. Used it once and left my hair very soft and hydrated. It is the best mask I&#x27;ve used SO FAR.  People say that John Masters Organics masks match or even beat Aubreys.  I may might be compelled to try JMO in the future (to see what the heck they&#x27;re raving about) but for now Aubreys for me is staple, staple, staple in my regimen.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, FLAT hair. 4 years of dying my hair pink, purple, blue AND bleaching it only made the problem worse. This past year I decided to invest in some hair thickening products, as well as masks to help my hair get strong and healthy again. This Aubrey mask did WONDERS for my hair! My hair was so silky soft after and noticeably thicker as I ran my fingers through it! I also have an issue with products weighing my hair down and making it greasy - this product is perfect if you have the same issues! No grease, and weighed down hair. If anything my hair has very nice bounce to it! Totally worth the price, and I would most certainly recommend this to anybody wit thin, dry, flat hair.</li>
            <li> All I can say is Aubrey Organics conditioners (original 2001 formulas) have become staple products to the masses for good reason, and they do not disappoint with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your hair is dry, damaged, chemically treated, straight, natural or somewhere in between, if you are looking for a great conditioning product that will leave you with super soft hair, then, Aubrey&#x27;s Blue-Green Algae Conditioning Mask is for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*Works well on its own or layered over other ingredients for super rich DT&lt;br /&gt;(as in with honey, olive oil, aloe)&lt;br /&gt;*It is an awesome product!&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;*They are getting really stingy with their (better) products. It only came in a teensy-weensy 4oz jar--I used about 3oz of it when I conditioned my (below-shoulder-length hair)&lt;br /&gt;* If you want to use it more than once a month it will add up (granted, it is worth every penny)--You really should get more product for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;User Tips:&lt;br /&gt;If your hair is oily or very fine, apply it to damp hair (layered over a little aloe vera) and shampoo out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your hair is very dry, damaged or chemically treated, cleanse hair first and layer it over olive oil for a super intense Deep Treatment and warm-water rinse OR co-wash out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a great protein conditioner and I think you will like it a lot for general use.&lt;br /&gt;In color and appearance, it reminds me a little of GPB, (I was using warm honey + Aubrey GPB combo exclusively for DT, which I still love, but I think I have a new alternate for switching up products!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the next best thing to making your own cleansing and conditioning product/s!&lt;br /&gt;-----------&lt;br /&gt;Other Great Recommended Shampoo &amp; Conditioner Products:&lt;br /&gt;1.

            <li> I look product and it soft my hair as soon as I placed on hair.i have very dry hair 4a/b type of curly hair. I was they sold in bigger jar. It will only b enough for 1more application for my hair.(I use a heating cap and sat for 30mins and shampoo out. (I don&#x27;t mind paying more for good product that works for my hair. Will order again. (Direction said use once a week but I will only use only when hair is really dry (will use other deep conditioners in between times)</li>
            <li> I love Aubrey&#x27;s product line.  GREAT STUFF and the quality is very good for the price point.  This however, just didn&#x27;t do it for me.  I have high expectations when it comes to a hair mask.  It takes time and patience but when I rinse it, I LIKE TO FEEL THE DIFFERENCE.  I will say, oddly, I really like the texture of this stuff - slimy IN A GOOD WAY? :)  I have better results with my homemade hair masks,but if you don&#x27;t have the time to do the &amp;#34;homemade&amp;#34; thing, then you will probably be quite happy with this product.</li>
            <li> My hair looks great; soft &amp; shiny, after I used the mask. Only thing is that with my long (middle of my back) hair I go through it really quick. Am barely getting a second treatment out of the jar.   But since I love what it does, love that it is all natural, I will buy it again. Smell you have to get used too, do not like it that much.</li>
            <li> You have to use a ton of this product to get it through your hair.  Aubrey Organics makes a glycerin protein conditioner that is just as good but at a way better value.  FYI be sure to use a hydrating mask after any protein treatment.</li>
            <li> WOW this stuff is great &amp; it works fantastically!! I LOVE this stuff! And I love the smell too! I too am a fan of Aubrey Organics &amp; use just about most of their shampoos &amp; conditioners. (I use their BGA Protein + Shampoo &amp; I love this shampoo too). I have thin, fine relaxed hair &amp; when I use these products they always make my hair SO full &amp; thick afterwards, I love it!!! I usually deep condition with this mask on dry hair &amp; leave it on overnight. The next day my hair is always so much softer, thicker &amp; fuller, it just keeps getting better &amp; better. My hair isn&#x27;t breaking and it&#x27;s getting healthier. The jar lasts me awhile because I don&#x27;t use a lot (a little goes a long way for me). However like everyone else, I wish it were bigger though. It is pricey (which is way I make the jar last awhile lol) but it&#x27;s worth it if you have thin/fine/damaged hair. Thanks Aubrey for making such a fabulous product, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I like this product because it made my hair feel very soft after using it, but I won&#x27;t be buying it again because I personally can&#x27;t afford this price for something that runs out so quickly. My hair is thin, about two inches past my shoulders, and it only lasted about 3 treatments. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m putting on too much, I put just enough to cover all of my hair. It does work though and it has an interesting smell, reminds me of maple and brown sugar oatmeal.</li>
            <li> Aubrey Organics is an awesome line. I don&#x27;t care for all of their products but they have a lot of winners and this one is a winner.</li>
            <li> This product gives an excellent shine and strength to your hair. It is slightly expensive but worth every penny. I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> This is a good product. I just wish that it was a larger container. It is  hard to use it as I am accustomed to use a product more freely instead of sparingly.</li>
            <li> Love this product - why more people don&#x27;t buy this is a mystery to me!  I think it&#x27;s amazing, really</li>
            <li> but! follow the instructions and use a great moisturizing conditioner afterwards. i rinsed out instead of shampooing and had somewhat crunchy hair for days. it was stronger...but crunchy.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this conditioner!! Huge fan of Aubrey Organics products. Only gave it four stars as the jar is tiny for the price and being a natural with a head full of thick hair this jar only gives me two treatments.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in addition to the Blue Chamomile Shampoo and Glycogen Conditioner. I applied the blue algae and  put on a conditioning cap underneath my no heat, heating cap and 100% polyester beanie and let it set for about 1 hr (even though the label said 15 min). I washed it out using the blue chamomile shampoo, followed by the glycogen conditioner and my hair was and still is so soft.  I am about 6 months post relaxer  and am transitioning  to natural and wow!!!!!  I am a true product junkie (PJ), but this is a keeper and will significantly decrease my search for products that are organic and that  work!!!  I am not really sure if I have scab hair within my 4b, but after trying all kinds of items and remedies, these three products definitely and noticeably softened my new growth and relaxed hair. I am so happy and am trucking along on my transitioning journey with this new discovery!!!!</li>
            <li> I really liked this mask.  I have thick long hair so it provided one heavy coverage and then there was enough for one more light coverage use.</li>
            <li> I have fine, wavy/curly hair, prone to frizz, and this gave me a the moisture and frizz control I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish there was a larger container.</li>
            <li> I guess it can&#x27;t have everything. Its really moisturizing and leaves hair feeling soft but strong. Doesn&#x27;t smell good and too expensive for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> Not impressed but not bad... smelly</li>
            <li> Thank you for this hair mask.  I use it weekly and it softens and thickens my hair after putting it on before shampooing for 15 minutes to half an hour.</li>
            <li> Purchased it after reading reviews -- supposedly this is really great for curly hair and makes a visible difference after the very first use.  Well.  I used it 2 days ago following the directions on the jar, and didn&#x27;t see any improvement at all -- my hair is as dry as always.  I&#x27;ve used other similar products before and could see at least some effect, some products lasted longer or wore out quickly -- but this mask didn&#x27;t do anything at all.  Plus I had to use half of a jar in just one application for shoulder-length curly hair... too expensive for the quantity and no effect. Not buying again.</li>
            <li> This product was suggested as part of the &amp;#34;things we love&amp;#34; on the mind body green website, so I thought I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was a waste of time and money for me.  First off, it smells pretty awful, but I was willing to overlook this for potential improvement to the body of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied half the jar to my long, fine hair and left it overnight (at the suggestion of another commenter).  In the morning I shampooed and blow dried as usual, but did not see or feel any improvement in my hair all.  And now my hair smells like the product :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest is going in the trash.</li>
            <li> not sure what i benefited from this product - i do not know what this product did for my hair, so i would not purchase again</li>
            <li> I like to use this stuff because it&#x27;s a deep conditioning alternative that isn&#x27;t super oily, so you don&#x27;t have to risk having greasy hair after one wash or stripped hair after 2.</li>
            <li> I use it as a protein deep conditioner for my fine, highly porous 4a/b hair.  I like to add my hair oils first and then layer this on top and let it sit in my hair. Afterwards my hair feels manageable and strong. You should give it a try.</li>
            <li> Buying again and again and again. Made my 4C hair soft &amp; easier to comb. Also noticed less shedding when combing. I keep my hair in small braids which I take down 3 or 4 times weekly.  This mask made this weeks take-downs easy.</li>
            <li> Not too crazy about this. The smell was different, not very pleasant. I didn&#x27;t get the hype after I used it either. It was just okay. For my thick long naturally kinky curly hair, it was only enough for ONE application which really bothered me! I can&#x27;t spend money on a product that I can only use once, and it doesn&#x27;t blow my mind.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  Several months ago my hair was bascially destroyed through overprocessing.  Huge amounts of breakage and my hair looked like straw.  After switching hairdressers I had a keratin treatment, deep conditioning treatment and purchased several rounds of organic keratin shampoo, conditioner and leave in treatment.  The Keratin products put out by Loma are excellent, however I will say this, Aubrey Organic Blue Green Algae Hair Mask in my opinion made a great deal of difference in the health of my hair.  Not only did it look healthy after a treatment, but my hair was so soft.  I am in my 40&#x27;s and my friend was floored when she felt my hair.  It is just so soft and healthy looking (even though the ends still had a great deal of breakage-you couldn&#x27;t tell). The most I can do for the damaged hair is wait for it to grow out.  This product is so affordable, the only negative aspect is the amount you are getting. I got 4-5 treatments and my hair is fairly long but thin.  I wish it came in a bigger size, I would definitely buy.  I put the product into my dry hair, work it through before bed, wrap it and wash it out the next morning.  Unbelievable results and it&#x27;s organic (what more could you ask for).</li>
            <li> I was looking for a deep conditioner to put on my locks after bleaching them, because I knew my hair would be damaged/dry. I used this immediately after washing the bleach out and left it on for an hour. My locks came out moisturized and the loose hair near my scalp was really soft. The only con about this product is that its only good for 2 uses &amp; it would be awesome if I could use it every 2 weeks but it&#x27;s expensive. (My hair type is 4b)</li>
