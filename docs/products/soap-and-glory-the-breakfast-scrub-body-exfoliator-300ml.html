            <li>This stuff is great and makes your skin very soft.</li>
            <li>Agreeably very strong sweet frangrance&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>I still love the Sugar Crush, but this is an equally fantastic product.</li>
            <li>After my first use my skin felt amazing.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s so sweet:)</li>
            <li>This scrub just makes me feel SMOOTH.</li>
            <li>Buy this stuff and enjoy your combo breakfast shower experience.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used scrubs before that made me feel like I had a film left on my skin...not pleasant.</li>
            <li>and I saw it is really a full of its jar.</li>
            <li>It is cheap and it works amazing at the same time !</li>
            <li>, I highly recommend this :)</li>
            <li>It works better than any other scrub I&#x27;ve tried, honestly.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the buy.</li>

            <li>I used it before shaving, and my legs haven&#x27;t felt so smooth since I was 16 years old.</li>
            <li>Lastly, this scrub rinses away without leaving my skin oily, but instead moisturized, which is my favorite aspect of this product.</li>
            <li>I like several others better, like Flake Away, and this stuff smells like maple syrup, pancakes and maybe bacon.</li>
            <li>it makes my body so soft and smooth...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin (or tub) greasy but effectively sloughs off dry skin and makes me feel soft and fresh.</li>

            <li>I absolutely love the pink scent.</li>
            <li>It not only smells good enough to eat, it makes my skin so soft.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend the body butter</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li>The only thing that is kind of bad, is the smell doesn&#x27;t last as long on your skin as I&#x27;d like, but other than that it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>Secondly, the amount of product needed to cover my is not excessive at all.</li>
            <li>The breakfast scrub is equally addicting, but the scent is a little too sweet for me.</li>
            <li>Exfoliates without being super drying, doesn&#x27;t leave a slick film in the tub or shower, and is quite hydrating.</li>

            <li> Other scrubs I&#x27;ve used in the past force me to use a quarter of the entire product in one setting and then leaves my skin so oily, I may as well have jumped into a vat of baby oil and that makes me feel so dirty.</li>

            <li> Amazing scrub! I have sensitive skin and this scrub cleans impurity meanwhile leaving a velvety skin.  Oh and it smells delightful.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this in the past for myself.  This year I purchased more for me!,  and as gifts!</li>
            <li> This exfoliating scrub smells amazing (sort of like warm brown sugar, yum!) and moisturizes while it exfoliates.  It leaves my skin super soft and glowing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m officially obsessed with this product! After my first use my skin felt amazing. So much smoother and softer. I&#x27;ve always had an issue finding a scrub that I felt like actually works. The Aveno daily scrub never felt like it was actually working and other scrubs left my face feeling waxy. This was perfect. It rinses clean and it has a delicious light fragrance. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> One of the best scrub I&#x27;ve ever used. Smell is not overwhelming just be careful so it wouldn&#x27;t get in your eyes.</li>
            <li> Wow, this is a great scrub for rough elbows and the backs of my upper arms. Makes my skin smooth and soft. Plus it smells like maple syrup and oatmeal...basically I stand in the shower and sniff the jar for about 5 minutes before I even get around to using it! A must buy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used scrubs before that made me feel like I had a film left on my skin...not pleasant. This scrub just makes me feel SMOOTH. I used it before shaving, and my legs haven&#x27;t felt so smooth since I was 16 years old. This is GOOD STUFF. I love the smell, too.</li>
            <li> I am admitting I am obsessed with the Soap and Glory Line. the righteous body butter is a must, the smell is amazing and I could put it on all day long. I just recently purchased flake away and am waiting in excitement. I absolutely love the pink scent. The breakfast scrub is equally addicting, but the scent is a little too sweet for me. Highly recommend the body butter</li>
            <li> I have always used the Sugar Crush Body Scrub, but I saw the reviews on the Breakfast Scrub so I decided to give it a try.  I&#x27;m so glad I did!  I absolutely love this scrub.  It not only smells good enough to eat, it makes my skin so soft.  I still love the Sugar Crush, but this is an equally fantastic product.</li>
            <li> This is the best scrub I&#x27;ve ever used. First, it smells delicious: sweet and warm. Secondly, the amount of product needed to cover my is not excessive at all. Lastly, this scrub rinses away without leaving my skin oily, but instead moisturized, which is my favorite aspect of this product. Other scrubs I&#x27;ve used in the past force me to use a quarter of the entire product in one setting and then leaves my skin so oily, I may as well have jumped into a vat of baby oil and that makes me feel so dirty. Soap and Glory&#x27;s scrub is the perfect combination of scent, texture, and moisture. I&#x27;ll be repurchasing!</li>
            <li> This is not my favorite scrub. I&#x27;ll tell you why...I like several others better, like Flake Away, and this stuff smells like maple syrup, pancakes and maybe bacon. For breakfast? Yes....In the shower, no. Just makes me hungry and sad I&#x27;m not eating breakfast. Like all Soap and Glory, this is a well made, quality product. But the scent is just not for me. If it&#x27;s for you? Buy this stuff and enjoy your combo breakfast shower experience.</li>
            <li> After I received it and I saw it is really a full of its jar.I love it&#x27;s aroma and that&#x27;s so sweet:) after I have used it and I suddenly felt my skin become slippery:D. It is magical and I hope it will give me a more wonderful feeling:) love it!</li>
            <li> Agreeably very strong sweet frangrance&lt;br /&gt;but if you love maple youll love this</li>
            <li> Awesome scrub, and smells heavenly.  Exfoliates without being super drying, doesn&#x27;t leave a slick film in the tub or shower, and is quite hydrating.</li>
            <li> Seriously best scrub ever. Smells so damn amazing and makes my skin feel so smooth! I use it every second day in the shower and I want to eat it every time I open the jar!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great and makes your skin very soft. The maker&#x27;s motto is, &amp;#34;if scrubbing you is bad, then we don&#x27;t want to be good!&amp;#34; I will be ordering again for sure.</li>
            <li> I like this...it makes my body so soft and smooth...i need to another one soon becuz im running out.</li>
            <li> yummy smell!  Great smooth skin afterwards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really used body scrubs, but this winter was so tough on my skin and I knew I needed something to help smoothe my dry skin. This scrub is the most delicious smelling stuff ever! It makes my skin sooo smoothe, I love it!! The only thing that is kind of bad, is the smell doesn&#x27;t last as long on your skin as I&#x27;d like, but other than that it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
