            <li> I got ripped off because i could have just waited and bought it here in amazon and paid half the price for the same size!</li>

            <li> I simply adore this perfume. Jadore is wonderful, this perfume is even a step better in many ways. I wear it most for myself because I just simply love the scent.</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance in an easy to hold container at a great value. I much prefer this size to the 3 oz version which is too heavy and hard to hold.</li>
            <li> I bought this one for my girlfriend. She is really enjoying it and happy with the product. It is the best perfume. She absolutely loves it and me too.&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, the service delivery is very good, it took only 2 days instead of 3-5 working days. So that, I received earlier than my expectation. I would rate 5 stars for the service and also 5 stars for the product. I will buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li> Have had so many complements. I would highly recommend this.  I have also purchased for gifts.  Buying on line was the best price.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this fragrance.  Very light and refreshing and clean smelling.  Seems to stay with me for a long time.  Have gotten many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> This scent is lovely and light,  but as others have pointed out, it doesn&#x27;t last.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for..Eau de Parfum , what you can&#x27;t  smell ... in the big bottle. I&#x27;m so disappointed</li>
            <li> My daughter would come in my room every morning to spray mine and I knew that it would be an excellent Christmas gift</li>
            <li> Got it so my wife doesn&#x27;t smell like like a dead dog festering in a subway tunnel during a heat wave.</li>
            <li> I think this Eau de Parfum  spray smelled good. Shipped quickly and got it for a great price. I would recommend this to every one</li>
            <li> This perfume has no scent.  I have bought other Calvin Kline perfumes and love their scents . I have Eternity which is nice light fresh scent. I have Obsession and  Euphoria. All long lasting and pretty. This bottle of Beauty has no scent of flowers or anything. More like an alcohol scent if anything. I won&#x27;t order perfumes again as is not returnable.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Too strong and heavy.</li>
            <li> This was a personal request for this perfume from a lady friend of mine while i was in the USA.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky when it comes to perfumes and colognes because I&#x27;m very sensitive on smells but this one is mild and sweet for my senses. I like flowery sweet and fresh scents. This is not my most favorite but I enjoyed wearing this and lasts all day.  I purchased mine at duty free from South Korea international airport. I paid about $60.00 plus for 1.7 fl oz.  I got ripped off because i could have just waited and bought it here in amazon and paid half the price for the same size! no more duty free purchases for me!</li>
            <li> Love it ...Beautiful smell</li>
            <li> This was a birthday gift for my wife and she really loved it. I thought the scent was very good as well. Not overpowering at all.</li>
