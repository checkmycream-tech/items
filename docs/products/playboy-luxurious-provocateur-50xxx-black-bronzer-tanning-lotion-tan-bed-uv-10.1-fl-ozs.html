            <li> gives you a dark tan without staining your hands after applying.</li>
            <li> it is sometimes it leaves a little orange/brownish residue on my hands, but if you wipe your hands down well after using the lotion it shouldn&#x27;t be an issue.</li>
            <li> I would recommend for someone who already has a decent base tan</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry it</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s tolerable not like sickening</li>

            <li> This item is the best tanning lotion I have used in a long time. It really does give you a nice even tone bronze look! This lotion does not give you that orangey look that many different lotions give you when it has the high number of bronzers in it. I will buy this lotion again!

            <li> Good color, great smell.  The smell is thr best part actually not like most lotions</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing! You will see instant results after using it your first time. I do recommend waiting until you have a good base tan before using it however. I love how the lotion squirts out of the bottle with the perfect amount. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is sometimes it leaves a little orange/brownish residue on my hands, but if you wipe your hands down well after using the lotion it shouldn&#x27;t be an issue. The delivery was fast and exactly as shown. Great lotion.</li>
            <li> Keeps you tan for days after tanning! Skin felt softer and smells great too.  Would definitely recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion! After the first time using it you can see a difference and it does don&#x27;t turn you orange! My husband even uses it and he is Irish so he is white and it even gives him a great color and does not turn him orange! If you are looking for a good tanning lotion this would be the one to get you won&#x27;t be disappointed!! :)</li>
            <li> I liked this product except for it didn&#x27;t make me as dark as i had hoped. I would recommend Hottie by Playboy instead.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great! This is the 3rd lotion by Playboy that I have used and I won&#x27;t be switching any time soon. The scent is not overpowering and it still smells fine after tanning. The result is a nice, deep, natural looking tan that intensifies with use.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a more of a tingle and not just bronzing lotion. I would not suggest buying. Thats all</li>
            <li> Really good bronzer,The lotion didn&#x27;t turn me orange, Which is always a plus!  The smell after you finish tanning is kinda funky and does last for a good 3-4 hours but it&#x27;s tolerable not like sickening stink just a different smell. I would recommend for someone who already has a decent base tan</li>
            <li> This lotion was pretty good! I have never used it before and it has totally helped me get darker! And it smells so good!!</li>
            <li> gives you a dark tan without staining your hands after applying.Bought 2, 1 for me 1 for daughtr-in-law. Will buy more.</li>
