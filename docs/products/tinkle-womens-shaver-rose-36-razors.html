            <li>kinda look like tiny straight razors but on further review they have little grooves that help cut off the peach fuzz.  </li>

            <li> Great product.  Hate to admit this... But shaving your Face... Makeup goes on so! Much smoother.&lt;br /&gt;These do not nick or cut and fold so you can safely put them into a drawer.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast !</li>
            <li> Be sure to watch the video. Exfoliates too. I am hooked. Goodbye cream hair removers!</li>
            <li> Just started using and am very satisfied. Very gentle on skin and does not cut or abrase.</li>
            <li> I found the razor to do an excellent job wet and or dry.&lt;br /&gt;Depending on your situation they gave me a nice clean smooth shave on my head.</li>
            <li> As time has gone on, I have been gifted with a peach fuzz on my face.  Women are NOT supposed to grow beards as they get older!  At any rate, I searched through the internet to find the best technique to get rid of this unwanted hair and stumbled across a lady with a very good shaving technique using the Tinkle razors.  So I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They kinda look like tiny straight razors but on further review they have little grooves that help cut off the peach fuzz.  In addition, this razor is very good at removing dead skin cells.  So when you are finished, your skin will be much softer.  At least mine was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should give fair warning.  This is a razor and therefore needs to be used with respect.  But if you are careful, hopefully you will see the great results I did.  I only have to shave about every two weeks and I no longer dread it.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a US citizen currently living in Australia. I have used this product for years in the US but I haven&#x27;t been able to find these in Australia. They work perfectly as they always did. Great for shaping eyebrows and for removing fuzzy facial hair.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these razors!  This is the first time I have tried them  I had read about them and wanted to try them,  I was hesitate to purchase a box of 36, but so happy I did.  Great product.</li>
            <li> So far so good, easy to use and gentle on the face. Making it apart of my routine.</li>
            <li> I saved a lot of money with this product instead of going into the beauty supply stores and paying a dollar per razor. They are wonderful and you can get more than one use out of them. They last forever. I will definitely buy again.</li>

            <li> Bought these for my face and eyebrows and I love love love these products! I decided to just go big and buy a large amount so I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about it for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product is great and fast shipping!</li>
