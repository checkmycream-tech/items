            <li>A+++ amazing pallet!</li>
            <li>amazing!</li>
            <li>I think it is amazing!</li>
            <li>This is the best and most convenient palette I have purchased, it holds so many pans of makeup perfectly and if the product is not magnetic, it comes with magnetic stickers to attach.</li>
            <li>I love my Z palette and the best part of it</li>
            <li>If you love make up and don&#x27;t like having a bunch of singles around, this is perfect.</li>
            <li>but I doubt I&#x27;d do that anyway.everything in great shape, but it&#x27;s a fair warning to be patient when depotting shadows and things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I depot all my products so that I can put them all in one handy place - this Z palette!</li>
            <li>Packaged Nicely, Sturdy, Beautiful.</li>
            <li>They are easy to store and great to travel with!</li>
            <li>Works awesome and love having all of my favorite makeup pans in one palette!</li>
            <li>Z Palette website has a lot of great information about how many pans each palette size holds, so if you are unsure what size to get, it&#x27;s a great resource.&lt;br</li>
            <li>that I figured I needed a good place to combine them all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Loved the z palette that I bought 2.  </li>
            <li>This is so great for creating your own makeup pallet.</li>
            <li>Good quality</li>
            <li>This product is good if you need to organize your make-up.  </li>
            <li>good premise, subpar materials and construction (made of cardboard).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super convenient and perfect for traveling.</li>
            <li>So excited to make my own custom palette with it!!</li>
            <li>I love Z palettes if you have not purchased one before they are great</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s great for the price &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>The best way I can describe the materials are -- a full slate magnate, cardboard, plastic, and some kind of paper(ish) material.</li>
            <li>Great way to free up space!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this purchase.    </li>

            <li>Love the Z Palettes!</li>
            <li>I ordered this one, and I love it!</li>
            <li>This is adorable!</li>
            <li>They are so convenient for so many reason!</li>
            <li>I love the Z palette!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be ordering another one soon!</li>
            <li>Will be great for traveling easily</li>
            <li>Nice and sleek and saves a lot more room!</li>
            <li>The Z palette is amazing.</li>
            <li>I am loving this product so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This came fast and it works great!</li>
            <li>I kind of wish it had a mirror instead of a transparent cover, but that would have just been for convenience.</li>
            <li>I bought these cases while I was in the process of creating my own palette.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have the metal stickers to use if your product isn&#x27;t magnetic.</li>
            <li>I never realized how having everything in one place is just so handy whether I&#x27;m at home or traveling.</li>
            <li>Not broken, totally great for make up geek make up!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;d be nice if it just came with a cuttable magnetic strip like I think the Unii palettes do.</li>
            <li>When I contacted the manufacturer they seemed aware that this was an issue and the best they could do was to offer me a 20% discount and encouraged me to repurchase more palettes.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly for all my depotted shadows, love the clear top, great magnetic closure.</li>
            <li>This is great I was able to fit all shape eyeshadow in this container.</li>
            <li>The magnet on both the lid and the bottom (where the pans stick to) are both very strong.</li>
            <li>i ordered 2 more and they are in the way:)!</li>
            <li>But I am so glad I did because I love it!</li>
            <li>I have things from my childhood that are comparable in quality to this that are still around and work just fine, in good condition, so just treat it with respect and</li>
            <li>You can see all your colors that you can use, and honestly I like being able to arrange the colors I like to coordinate together.  </li>
            <li>It was secure, in good shape.</li>
            <li>AMAZING, I love it and use it every day.</li>
            <li>Best part is that there is a clear cover.</li>
            <li>Came with the magnets and everything, great condition, and I know it will be amazingly useful.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery and great product from Amazon :)</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE my Z Palette!</li>
            <li>( but zpalettes are great the first one I bought was on eBay</li>
            <li>Great price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>De-potting is fun &amp; so handy!</li>
            <li>The magnets work amazing with makeup geek eye shadows and the metal rounds work pretty good with the MAC shadows I have.</li>
            <li>magnetic patch is nice and strong, stronger than those craft magnetic patches you can buy are</li>
            <li>The magnet on the bottom and the magnetic closure are nice and strong.</li>
            <li>But it is a fabulous tool for most make-up!</li>
            <li>I love my zpalettes.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say enough great things about this!</li>
            <li>I love the z palette</li>
            <li>You can put your favorite eyeshadow, blushes, and many more.</li>
            <li>Now you can just bring your favorite colors.</li>
            <li>As a makeup artist I love these things to no end.</li>
            <li>i need to get more</li>
            <li>Received mine today and I love it already.</li>
            <li>Went from carrying around nine palettes to fitting seven of those into this z palette.</li>
            <li>I even got some magnets with my z palette which I will have more within a week.  </li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>But I love it.  </li>
            <li>I was able to reduce clutter from bulky makeup packaging.</li>
            <li>I love my palette, it reduced the space my makeup takes up dramatically.</li>
            <li>(None of the hints about heating the cases to loosen the glue worked on many brands also)</li>
            <li>The bottom is magnetic and most makeup pans will be able to stick, but this comes with some metal pieces to affix to the bottom of your pans if they aren&#x27;t magnetic</li>
            <li>The interior of the palette is magnetic, and there is a transparent cover in the top.</li>
            <li>It is better than buying a MAC or Make Up For Ever palette.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I will be buying more when needed!&lt;br</li>
            <li>only downside to this palette is that it isn&#x27;t made out of the BEST material.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t sure it was just what she wanted</li>
            <li>falling in love &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>I would buy more if they were cheaper.</li>
            <li>I have mostly MAC eye shadows, but also some MUG pans.</li>
            <li>i wish it was not pricey as it is, but i love it  anyway</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I ruined so many trying to use this palette.  </li>
            <li>The Z Palette is changing how we store make up for the better.</li>
            <li>I have never travelled with it, it mostly sits on my makeup desk and gets used maybe once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the size.  </li>
            <li>I look more organized</li>
            <li>notice that it&#x27;s not the most durable product</li>
            <li>So convenient, would&#x27;ve gotten more stars if the magnets were stronger.</li>
            <li>Most of my make up was already magnetic</li>
            <li>It is made of recyclable materials, but it sure feels sturdy.  </li>
            <li>It is an actual Z Palette brand and came in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>So glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>I wanted a palette that offered more freedom</li>
            <li>I was able to depot it all</li>
            <li>and it all fit!</li>
            <li>I love my Z Palettes.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love my Z Palette.</li>
            <li>I just keep wanting more</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>And I love that it comes with magnets for the pots that aren&#x27;t magnetized.</li>
            <li>I love all the color and pattern choices it comes</li>
            <li>Just have to get more palettes to finish them all.</li>
            <li>That makes it even better.</li>
            <li>I found cheaper alternatives to the Z palette, such as magnetic craft boxes, but the design of the Z palette is perfect for makeup application.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s able to keep all of her shadows in here and with lots of room to add more shadows.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have more space in my stash now.</li>
            <li>Love having all my depotted shadows in one place.</li>
            <li>I love this pallet better than the MAC pro pallet (which i also have).</li>
            <li>This palette seems more lightweight than the others I ordered before.</li>
            <li>It has made my eye make up area more organized</li>
            <li>so I was worried they wouldn&#x27;t fit in the palette, but they do!</li>
            <li>I love it for traveling, which I do a lot.</li>
            <li>Love thiS</li>
            <li>I love this palette.</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m able to see the colors that I don&#x27;t use often.</li>
            <li>I ended up buying some magnet tape at Michael&#x27;s, which has a much tackier/stickier backing and works great</li>
            <li>Perfect for de-potting some Urban Decay Shadows.  </li>
            <li>I like the window on the top</li>
            <li>Love this palette</li>
            <li>it just helps me keep my makeup more organized</li>
            <li>and I reach more for colors</li>
            <li>Lol it helps organize your makeup very well.</li>
            <li>I wish the larger palettes came in more colors, but the Z palette is just the best thing ever.</li>
            <li>I have the official MK Compact Pro but wanted something that made better use of the space.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>I love that the palettes also come with adhesive metal disks to help with non-magnetic pans.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love them for my pressed shadows.</li>
            <li>I have so much more room in my makeup area now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute and practical.</li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>but I plan to buy more</li>
            <li>Will definitely purchase more!!!</li>
            <li>Very worth the purchase!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my absolute favorite thing that I own!</li>
            <li>Super convenient to be able to personalize everything you need/want into one place!</li>
            <li>My favorite uses for them are making custom palettes, and to condense bulkier palettes into something more easily to store.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it claims, good quality.</li>
            <li>This product is pretty good.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re very careful, I&#x27;m sure you can keep everything in great shape, but it&#x27;s a fair warning to be patient when depotting shadows and things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so easy it even helped me get inspired and use more colors that I used to do in one</li>
            <li>Most powder makeup products can be de-potted easily (check youtube for tutorials).</li>
            <li>The material is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>works perfectly for all the loose blushes or shadows a have depotted.</li>
            <li>These hold the pans securely and are better than I imagined.</li>
            <li>I used to use Mac Palettes since I use their shadows a lot, but they don&#x27;t offer all of these features and didn&#x27;t fit as many.</li>
            <li>These empty palettes are the best.</li>
            <li>when I finally received it &amp; transferred my favorite eyeshadows, I feel more organized &amp; happy.</li>
            <li>perfect, just as expected</li>
            <li>I feel they are more secure in the MAC Palette.</li>
            <li>Very slim... good find</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sturdy and easy to clean!</li>
            <li>and if you think it&#x27;s a bummer dropping one of your compacts, try dropping a z-palette full!  </li>
            <li>Now my gf has some of all her make up in this palette, and no need to have a bag full of lil make up containers !</li>
            <li>so it makes it super easy when de-potting my shadows!</li>
            <li>I picked up my first Z-Palette at IMATS NY 2013 and immediately fell in love!</li>
            <li>The magnetic bottom of the Z-Palette is super strong so my shadows don&#x27;t move around, but I can take them out and rearrange them with ease!</li>
            <li>On the other hand, the Z Palette would be perfect for eyeshadows like Makeup Geek.  </li>
            <li>It was easy and it came with directions.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great because I was able to add different size eyeshadows and even blushes.</li>
            <li>It makes it easy to change out eyeshadows</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to change them around.</li>
            <li>So easy to use.</li>
            <li>They r easy to find</li>
            <li>the colors is easy but the colors stay where you put them.</li>
            <li>The magnet is strong it fits a lot</li>
            <li>and it is still going strong</li>
            <li>so you can see your products and the strong magnet.</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t bother tryung to dupe unless you have some strong magnets and are building it</li>
            <li>This is my first Z palette and I must say that I am loving it.</li>
            <li>,I feel super organized now!</li>
            <li>It looks very pretty!</li>
            <li>Love my purchase and fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t have one yet GET IT, then giggle at how your huge set of make up</li>
            <li>It feels sturdy and secure and I have not had any issues with it.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic,  z palatte😃</li>
            <li>It really is a great thing to have if you want to have a variety of colors on hand, rather than looking through all you individual eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li>You can fit both products in the palette and it minimizes the amount that you need to carry.</li>
            <li>Rugged and fantastic quality.</li>
            <li>Totally secure.</li>
            <li>So I just attached the included magnets to the bottom of the MAC shadows and now they are just as secure.</li>
            <li>Great product however only fit 27 morphe brushes eyeshadows whereas on the morphe brushes website it claimed to fit 28.</li>
            <li>Great Help For a Family of 6 with extra to spare</li>
            <li>I primarily use the z palettes to hold my eyeshadows.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a great size, especially for traveling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great that you can put different size products in it as well.</li>
            <li>Great if you have several palettes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a puzzle but they will fit and once placed</li>
            <li>25ct magnetic pans (available on Amazon for cheap!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;See through lid is great so I don&#x27;t have to open it to see what colors I&#x27;d like to</li>
            <li>Smaller ones great for travel too.</li>
            <li>Overall, great product.</li>
            <li>saved all my MAC containers and will be turning them in for free products.</li>
            <li>and honestly it&#x27;s too much work in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>i suppose you could secure it with a ghetto rubberband.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not perfect because for me a perfect would be handmade by a loved one.</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t like the disk being larger than the shadow pan), and a price reduction (just because I love a good bargain).</li>
            <li>It holds more than I have right now</li>
            <li>None of my other palettes are able to do this and it has been a great thing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The bottom magnet isn&#x27;t super strong so changing out</li>
            <li>high quality with a nice magnetic surface.  </li>
            <li>Filled it up right away!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure of the exact size on these palettes</li>
            <li>They declutter your makeup and honestly the palettes remind you of colors you Dont normally use.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money!</li>
            <li>De-potting can be a bit of work, so be sure to watch some tutorials first.</li>
            <li>This palette is exactly what I was looking for because I needed to have an easier way to access my favorite makeup.</li>
            <li>I am having so much fun customizing my pallet!</li>
            <li>Extremely useful product!</li>
            <li>Hundreds of dollars worth of eyeshadows were ruined!</li>
            <li>The hardest thing is, is fitting the shadows in the pallet to make them look pretty.</li>
            <li>Before I bought this, I decided to do a &amp;#34;DIY Z Palette&amp;#34; and I was so excited to make one</li>
            <li>and I would be willing to buy this again to use for more shadows as I get them.</li>
            <li>So much fun to add my pans to the palette and have them all organized and in one place!  </li>
            <li>it saved so much space in my makeup storage and makes an easy access!</li>
            <li>allowed me to clean up my bathroom/makeup area</li>
            <li>Also love the clear top.</li>
            <li>Love that you can see what colors you have through the clear top, and that it comes with adhesive discs so that you can depot your product and use a disc to magnetize it to the pallett.</li>
            <li>I love the clear top</li>
            <li>My zpalette came fast and loved it so much</li>
            <li>I can honestly say my collection wouldn&#x27;t be complete without them!</li>
            <li>This softened the glue pretty well and most popped out pretty easily.</li>
            <li>The clear window on the front is also really nice</li>
            <li>Overall, I am content with this product, and I think that it was a good purchase.</li>
            <li>Z Palette has received such good reviews, both from gurus and reviewers, so I have to imagine that my experience is probably just a one-off, but I thought I would share it</li>
            <li>very recommendable if you want to organize your makeup more efficiently.  </li>
            <li>Removing the one and two from the billions of palettes i have make it some much easier to find the colors i love.</li>
            <li>I bought this palette to hold some eyeshadows that were taking up too much room and this palette holds all 15 of them with room for more.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Z palette and after an evening with a candle, screwdriver and all of my potted makeup, I soon had a full Z palette of unpotted makeup.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems to be sturdy, but take good care of it like anything else and it will last.</li>
            <li>You can easily arrange how you want the colors and fit over 20 MAC shadows in one large Z Palette.</li>
            <li>i love clear lid which makes it easy for me to see what shadows are in what pallet.</li>
            <li>The closure on these is very nice although if traveling I would recommend putting it under clothes in a suitcase to keep it closed.</li>
            <li>Its also great for depotting other eyeshadows to declutter your stash…</li>
            <li>this is a great thing way to store blushes, powders, and any other types of makeup that comes in pans.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very travel friendly!</li>
            <li>and I love being able to see my products without having to open it.</li>
            <li>Love it would buy more in the future</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and just as described.  </li>
            <li>I also had to super glue a couple magnets to the product.</li>
            <li>Overall, great idea and very sturdy design.</li>
            <li>All MK products are magnetic and they fit exactly.</li>
            <li>The palette itself is very light and easy to open</li>
            <li>The black is sleek and the magnetic closure is great.  </li>
            <li>This is the first z palette I&#x27;ve ever gotten, and it&#x27;s so much fun!  </li>
            <li>This is my first empty palette of any sort, but so far I&#x27;m very happy.  </li>
            <li>and I will definitely continue to buy more Z Palettes!</li>
            <li>More room!&lt;br /&gt;The magnetic back is really strong.</li>
            <li>Love that I was able to consolidate all of my single shadows into one spot.</li>
            <li>And my prayers were answered when I got it yesterday with not cracks and with the sticky magnets and bonus magnets is came packaged very well and SUPER FAST!!!</li>
            <li>My large one fit 2 blushes, 1 bronzer, 1 pressed powder, and about 12 eye-shadows.  </li>
            <li>The lid also has a light magnetic closure to keep it from flying open and has a translucent window to see inside which is great if you have multiple of these..</li>
            <li>Very slim profile, but not too cheap feeling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The magnetic lid is amazing and it stays shut to matter what happens (unless you open it, of course).</li>
            <li>so I could use them more frequently.</li>
            <li>Make sure you cover the pot completely or it will break while releasing it.  </li>
            <li>A couple of my shadows got fractured in the process, but it was still worth it.  </li>
            <li>It is 100% worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I rarely ever use it.</li>
            <li>really well - one has been on multiple 1000+ mile road trips and looks just as good as the one that stays at home.</li>
            <li>I love the design of it with the clear plastic</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for design or it being colorful or girlie.</li>
            <li>The slim design will also useful for traveling.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it.</li>
            <li>I did think it was going to be a bit bigger to be honest</li>
            <li>Nice palette but such a hassle having to put glue on the magnets they supposedly come with it but doesnt work!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for the true makeup collector!</li>
            <li>I got this pretty quickly even though I ordered it on a holiday weekend.</li>
            <li>The small square magnets fit perfect on Urban Decay shadows and Nars.</li>
            <li>Its pretty sturdy, but I do wish they would make a palette that is not made out of cardboard.. but overall, still a nice product.</li>
            <li>Instead, I popped my shadows out of their primary case if I could and put them under my blow dryer on high for a minute and pried them out with a metal makeup spatula.</li>
            <li>great, comes in many colors, thin, light weight, durable (so far), saved me lots of space.</li>
            <li>Holds so many more eyeshadow pots than my old MAC palettes, that finally wore out and broke.</li>
            <li>The large really doesn&#x27;t fit a lot of eyeshadows.</li>
            <li>It is a simple and easy way to put your makeup in one palette without having to worry about pre-cut shapes!</li>
            <li>The large size held all my makeup!</li>
            <li>I have had mine for a few months now, and even after daily use, it keeps up great!  </li>
            <li>This palette comes with nickel size round magnets (perfectly fits MAC eyeshadows) and smaller square magnets.</li>
            <li>so I just ordered a new one and prayed it came not cracked!!!</li>
            <li>It really is handy for all your single eyeshadows and blushes or whatever else</li>
            <li>I received it very fast.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product and concept, even though I am sure it is not original to Z palette.</li>
            <li>I am now planning to order several more</li>
            <li>looks &amp;#34;normal.&amp;#34;  ;)</li>
            <li>so glad I finally got this z palette!</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s the only thing they could do better.  </li>
            <li>You can stick so many different things in there.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>Looks exactly like online pictures.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a makeup artist and this helps so much with saving space!</li>
            <li>this saves so much space!</li>
            <li>It definitely feels cheap!  </li>
            <li>THANKS!</li>
            <li>Macs palette is 16 dollars and hold 15, and MUFE sells their palette for $20 and only holds 10, and here you can just throw what you&#x27;ve got, whatever size, and it&#x27;ll hold a lot more.  </li>
            <li>I love my z palette, the only thing was most of my shadows didnt have the proper metal to stick to the magnet</li>
            <li>I know you can purchase more, but that seems like a rip off to me, they should include enough to fully use the palette</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s magnetic and can hold  many colors and in different sizes.</li>
            <li>Sturdy, spacious, exactly as described.</li>
            <li>It was my first time trying this out for myself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a makeup artists and these were very helpful!</li>
            <li>With this you create exactly what you want.  </li>
            <li>and now I use more of the makeup i already had, because I can finally see it all!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I decided to buy one because I&#x27;ve used MAC palettes for years since I first started getting into makeup.</li>
            <li>Z Palettes are the way to go and they really have helped me utilize all of the makeup that I have and not foret about them stored in some drawer!</li>
            <li>Exactly what it is...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many times to consolidate palettes, finally some one made one!  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Very convenient!</li>
            <li>I bought my first Z Palette and depotted all of my MAC eyeshadows into it.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li>pretty close.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall I love it</li>
            <li>I had to glue the magnet to the shadow, other than that I love it!</li>
            <li>Not only do I have more space</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and worth the money.</li>
            <li>and I love the different prints you can pick out also!</li>
            <li>&amp; they look so pretty together.</li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>Z Palettes are an absolute must have for anyone who loves, wears, or owns any makeup!</li>
            <li>The Z palette is nice and works as expected.  </li>
            <li>I mostly depotted an Urban Decay book of shadows hoping to save space.  </li>
            <li>The Z palette would be advantageous if you wanted to put both eyeshadows and blushes on the same palette, then the Z palette would be much better.</li>
            <li>mine was a blue black and super great quality.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased my first and was able to organize a large amount of my eyeshadows into one palette.</li>
            <li>While, I did consolidate products and clear up space in my make-up collection, I broke some products trying to pry them out of original containers.</li>
            <li>Completely environmentally friendly.</li>
            <li>specific palette is not the domed one--you most likely won&#x27;t be able to place your baked shadows (or as I tried, bronzers and blush) into this particular one.</li>
            <li>It seems to be better quality than my Leopard print Z Palette which is strange</li>
            <li>so I thought this small sample size would be a good way to try these products</li>
            <li>It makes it so easy to take on trips and select only the ones you need.  </li>
            <li>I loved the concept, but the GlamRX is too small to hold much of anything.</li>
            <li>I have all my shadows in 2 large Z palettes now.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for when I travel and do not want to take all my palettes with me but certain colors.  </li>
            <li>Does not look large at all but works well and does the job.</li>
            <li>I purchased the large pallet (not for traveling)</li>
            <li>I purchased a few more Z-palettes to use with ALL my makeup!</li>
            <li>I was a little nervous about getting one these from a few reviews I read, but I think its perfect for what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Easy peasy with a flat iron.</li>
            <li>These work really well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sleek and well made.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a makeup artist and have  a sooooo much stuff.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s cardboard, but I see this holding up very well to it purpose- keeping my b-string, horse show makeup in one thingy, instead of chasing around a dozen separate compacts.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this seller for ZPalettes!</li>
            <li>Made things SO much easier for me and plan on ordering another one soon.</li>
            <li>Now the ones I really like and need are in one place.</li>
            <li>My shadows and blushes feel secure and I&#x27;ll save money in the future by buying shadows in pan form.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very durable.</li>
            <li>Makeup packaging takes up so much room and these palettes allow you to de-pot and save a lot of space.</li>
            <li>This thing is literally falling apart on me and the real kicker?</li>
            <li>, you&#x27;ll need to be gentle with it.</li>
            <li>Very practical</li>
            <li>Works better than I expected it to.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>you fill the whole palette</li>
            <li>Very sturdy.</li>
            <li>All my individual eye shadows fit into this case.</li>
            <li>but it has held up really well.</li>
            <li>recommend you purchase a stainless steel cosmetic spatula to help with the de-potting process so that you don&#x27;t ruin your makeup</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaper than buying an empty MAC palette and much more convenient.</li>
            <li>The design of the whole pallet is slim and doesn&#x27;t take up allot of room.</li>
            <li>Makes it so much easier having all my eyeshadows in one place.</li>
            <li>It is really convenient to have all of my favorites in one palette.</li>
            <li>Also, for this price, I really don&#x27;t feel like I can complain too much.  </li>
            <li>Also, for this price, I really don&#x27;t feel like I can complain too much.  </li>
            <li>The Z Palettes are much sturdier too.</li>
            <li>They have held up reasonably well and kept my makeup protected.</li>
            <li>but I really really like it.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve really helped me condense my makeup collection.</li>
            <li>Even though they are made of cardboard with a plastic window, they are really sturdy.</li>
            <li>It has saved me so much room in my makeup collection</li>
            <li>I really like having all my makeup in ONE container with a window.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard so much about these palettes and when my makeup collection exceeded their space</li>
            <li>that being said, still very sturdy well built product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like this...</li>
            <li>and this really did the trick combining</li>
            <li>My matte Urban Decay shadows did NOT like this at all and most cracked which I fixed with rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li>other great thing about this palette is that you can flip the cover over completely to the opposite side and hold the palette in one hand when using it.  </li>
            <li>The only tricky part can be getting the shadows out of their original containers, but I found that an xacto knife, and some rubbing alcohol (to loosen / dissolve the glue)</li>
            <li>Better than expected!</li>
            <li>I had purchased a special palette from urban decay but it came in a cardboard box and was very bulky and cumbersome.</li>
            <li>It really helped me declutter - all my older makeup is now in one place.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having this palette made it easy for me to depot my single ones and put them all in one place.</li>
            <li>It was large enough to fit all of my single eye shadows in and I still have room for more and extra magnets.</li>
            <li>This palette came with a small baggie full of circle and square magnet stickers, so the eye shadows I had that didn&#x27;t have any glue left on them or weren&#x27;t already magnetic are super easy to convert</li>
            <li>I love the little metal stickers that comes with it, it secures my shadows very securely.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>so I am completely confident my expensive shadows are safe</li>
            <li>Although I love this Z palettes and this is my second purchase I have had the same problem with this twice already.</li>
            <li>Sturdy, and larger than I had expected, which is nice.</li>
            <li>Most likely will get my 2nd palette soon.</li>
            <li>I definitely have used my BoS shadows more recently because of the fact that I can immediately see the shadows through the lid and don&#x27;t have to fuss with UD&#x27;s packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I can really nudge them in the corners and right next to each</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I highly recommend a zpalette if you want to depot any of your makeup and save some space.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly unrecommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to all of my MUA friends and everyone that wears makeup.</li>
            <li>I love that it came with little magnets in case your shadows aren&#x27;t magnetic.</li>
            <li>I love that little magnets are provided.  </li>
            <li>I wish it was just a little more sleek though</li>
            <li>so I tried to make the best out of a bad situation I coved the palette with zebra duck tape and used it</li>
            <li>These palettes are great for organizing random shadows and saving room in your kit.</li>
            <li>I was worried that the clear window would be too flimsy, but it&#x27;s much sturdier than I thought and hasn&#x27;t been a problem.</li>
            <li>Saves space since I pressed my Concrete Minerals and Shiro Cosmetics shadows, and my depotted NYX shadows.</li>
            <li>and i find that Im using things i normally didnt reach for.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this palette if you are looking to de-clutter and free up space on your vanity or other makeup storage area.</li>
            <li>Not only can you instantly see what is inside, the lid flips underneath completely, so it is easy to hold while applying makeup.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Magnet in the back feels strong enough to keep my things in place (however, I wouldn&#x27;t be throwing this thing around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the large one holds about 20 and the extra large holds about 27</li>
            <li>Unit slides right into my make up bag which hangs on the back of the bathroom door.</li>
            <li>Right now I only have my Inglot shadows in it</li>
            <li>and I plan on getting a few more plus a small one more for day to day carry around.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a must-have for anyone looking to make their collection a little more professional and streamlined.  </li>
            <li>and it still feels like new.</li>
            <li>It looks brand new in the morning.</li>
            <li>fits my new shadows</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new, just stick the magnetic stickers to your pans and set them in the Z-Palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want something this big, TKB trading has a smaller one that&#x27;s really cheap and people tend to like it.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first because of some other reviews I saw mentioned that this one was made of cardboard and there were other brands out there that did not use cardboard but a more sturdier plastic.  </li>
            <li>Not my first Z Palette and definitely not my last.</li>
            <li>I have tried several of the empty magnetic palettes and this one is my favorite by far.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest having pure acetone to remove the glue residue off the back.</li>
            <li>Were smaller than I expected so I was glad that I bought the extra large as well.</li>
            <li>so I worry a little about how long it will hold up, but for now it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s easily fixed with new ones from a hardware or craft store.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe I just got a lemon, but for half the price I can get one of the new palettes from MAC and they are infinitely better quality (actual plastic rather than plastic-coated cardboard!).</li>
            <li>If it was about half an inch taller, it would fit 28</li>
            <li>This is my second large z palette</li>
            <li>The clear window lets you see what&#x27;s inside, and the lid flips under</li>
            <li>The only thing I dont like is the stickers that come with it dont really stick.</li>
            <li>Overall though I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I anticipated a flimsy front cover, but was pleasantly surprised to find a sturdy piece of plastic.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t want to go through the whole process of sending it back</li>
            <li>While I wish it weren&#x27;t so much work to depot the shadows, I will definitely purchase this product again to condense my makeup collection.</li>
            <li>only issue is that makeup (shadow or blush) that is domed us too high for the lid to shut!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been doing make up professionally for 10 years and this palette is genius.</li>
            <li>Also very affordable and comes in different colours and sizes.</li>
            <li>but so far I have no complaints.</li>
            <li>Some pans are naturally compatible with the Z Palette&#x27;s magnets and some aren&#x27;t, so</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m surprised this wasn&#x27;t taken into account during the design process.</li>
            <li>I buy a lot of individual pans of eye shadows and blushes and this palette keeps everything looking very neat and organized.</li>
            <li>n wild shadows into these.</li>
            <li>But I much prefer these to the Uniis because you can actually see what&#x27;s inside.</li>
            <li>I love the Z Palette, and I have a few in different colors.</li>
            <li>I took all my bulky and broken blush and eye shadow containers and depotted the metal trays by setting them on my warm straightener on a piece of wax paper to protect them.</li>
            <li>It was also large enough to fit my Naked palette in along with other items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My first impression was that it was heavy, I expected it to be somewhat light and flimsy, but that was not the case.  </li>
            <li>It love how much it cut down on excess packaging, the included magnets are pretty weak and I put extras on the items that needed them.</li>
            <li>As a result, one of the eyeshadows (the darkest one no less) broke, ruining the case and all the colors within.</li>
            <li>(Plus, you can &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34; a fractured shadow back together with some rubbing alcohol and a bit of light pressing down).</li>
            <li>I never traveled with, or kept the palettes in a high humidity area such as a bathroom.</li>
            <li>along with 3 single mac shadows that i had laying around; i rarely use my naked palettes but when I organized them here ive been using this alot!</li>
            <li>the round magnets fit MAC shadows and larger blushes.</li>
            <li>I have no other palettes to compare this to, though.  </li>
            <li>If you have some cosmetics that are rounded on top, they may not fit!!!</li>
            <li>heard there are a lot of fake z palettes on amazon, I highly doubt this is fake but even if it is its a great product and worth the $.</li>
            <li>Much sturdier than I expected....</li>
            <li>When you purchase a pallet that is already full of shadows and blushes there is usually around 1\4 of the colors that you will never use.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so hard to get the makeup out of the original packaging.  </li>
            <li>few things that I would love to see in the future: a larger palette size (the pro size isn&#x27;t much bigger than the large), smaller adhesive metal disks for small shadows</li>
            <li>seriously, once I was done with the messy part... I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>The only downside is that getting your makeup OUT of its ORIGINAL cases is really hard.</li>
            <li>I bought my Z Palette directly from the manufacturer after collecting so many random eyeshadow samples and individual pots that I wanted to depot</li>
            <li>I did save space, but not sure the effort is worth it.</li>
            <li>The only con is that there seems to be a warp on the lid so that it doesn&#x27;t close exactly as it should unless you give it a little push.</li>
            <li>black Z-Palette looks very sleek.  </li>
            <li>A lot harder to get the pots out at first than expected</li>
            <li>go ahead and spend a little more for the hard plastic case of the UNII.</li>
            <li>I felt like it was just such a waste that I wasn&#x27;t using the shadows because of Urban Decay&#x27;s frivolous packaging, so I decided to invest in this Large Z Palette.</li>

            <li> amazing!</li>
            <li> I think it is amazing!</li>
            <li> This is the best and most convenient palette I have purchased, it holds so many pans of makeup perfectly and if the product is not magnetic, it comes with magnetic stickers to attach.</li>
            <li> I love my Z palette and the best part of it</li>
            <li> If you love make up and don&#x27;t like having a bunch of singles around, this is perfect.</li>
            <li> but I doubt I&#x27;d do that anyway.everything in great shape, but it&#x27;s a fair warning to be patient when depotting shadows and things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I depot all my products so that I can put them all in one handy place - this Z palette!</li>

            <li> that I figured I needed a good place to combine them all.&lt;br</li>

            <li> This product is good if you need to organize your make-up.  </li>
            <li> good premise, subpar materials and construction (made of cardboard).</li>

            <li> So excited to make my own custom palette with it!!</li>
            <li> I love Z palettes if you have not purchased one before they are great</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s great for the price &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> The best way I can describe the materials are -- a full slate magnate, cardboard, plastic, and some kind of paper(ish) material.</li>
            <li> Great way to free up space!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase.    </li>

            <li> I will be ordering more of these!</li>
            <li> Love the Z Palettes!</li>
            <li> I ordered this one, and I love it!</li>
            <li> This is adorable!</li>
            <li> They are so convenient for so many reason!</li>
            <li> I love the Z palette!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be ordering another one soon!</li>
            <li> Will be great for traveling easily</li>
            <li> Nice and sleek and saves a lot more room!</li>
            <li> The Z palette is amazing.</li>
            <li> I am loving this product so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This came fast and it works great!</li>
            <li> I kind of wish it had a mirror instead of a transparent cover, but that would have just been for convenience.</li>
            <li> I bought these cases while I was in the process of creating my own palette.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have the metal stickers to use if your product isn&#x27;t magnetic.</li>
            <li> I never realized how having everything in one place is just so handy whether I&#x27;m at home or traveling.</li>
            <li> Not broken, totally great for make up geek make up!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;d be nice if it just came with a cuttable magnetic strip like I think the Unii palettes do.</li>
            <li> When I contacted the manufacturer they seemed aware that this was an issue and the best they could do was to offer me a 20% discount and encouraged me to repurchase more palettes.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for all my depotted shadows, love the clear top, great magnetic closure.</li>
            <li> This is great I was able to fit all shape eyeshadow in this container.</li>
            <li> The magnet on both the lid and the bottom (where the pans stick to) are both very strong.</li>
            <li> i ordered 2 more and they are in the way:)!</li>
            <li> But I am so glad I did because I love it!</li>
            <li> I have things from my childhood that are comparable in quality to this that are still around and work just fine, in good condition, so just treat it with respect and</li>
            <li> You can see all your colors that you can use, and honestly I like being able to arrange the colors I like to coordinate together.  </li>
            <li> It was secure, in good shape.</li>
            <li> AMAZING, I love it and use it every day.</li>
            <li> Best part is that there is a clear cover.</li>
            <li> Came with the magnets and everything, great condition, and I know it will be amazingly useful.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and great product from Amazon :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE my Z Palette!</li>
            <li> ( but zpalettes are great the first one I bought was on eBay</li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> De-potting is fun &amp; so handy!</li>
            <li> The magnets work amazing with makeup geek eye shadows and the metal rounds work pretty good with the MAC shadows I have.</li>
            <li> magnetic patch is nice and strong, stronger than those craft magnetic patches you can buy are</li>
            <li> The magnet on the bottom and the magnetic closure are nice and strong.</li>
            <li> But it is a fabulous tool for most make-up!</li>
            <li> I love my zpalettes.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say enough great things about this!</li>
            <li> I love the z palette</li>
            <li> You can put your favorite eyeshadow, blushes, and many more.</li>
            <li> Now you can just bring your favorite colors.</li>
            <li> As a makeup artist I love these things to no end.</li>
            <li> i need to get more</li>
            <li> Received mine today and I love it already.</li>
            <li> Went from carrying around nine palettes to fitting seven of those into this z palette.</li>
            <li> I even got some magnets with my z palette which I will have more within a week.  </li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> But I love it.  </li>
            <li> I was able to reduce clutter from bulky makeup packaging.</li>
            <li> I love my palette, it reduced the space my makeup takes up dramatically.</li>
            <li> (None of the hints about heating the cases to loosen the glue worked on many brands also)</li>
            <li> The bottom is magnetic and most makeup pans will be able to stick, but this comes with some metal pieces to affix to the bottom of your pans if they aren&#x27;t magnetic</li>
            <li> The interior of the palette is magnetic, and there is a transparent cover in the top.</li>
            <li> It is better than buying a MAC or Make Up For Ever palette.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I will be buying more when needed!&lt;br</li>
            <li> only downside to this palette is that it isn&#x27;t made out of the BEST material.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t sure it was just what she wanted</li>
            <li> falling in love &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I would buy more if they were cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have mostly MAC eye shadows, but also some MUG pans.</li>
            <li> i wish it was not pricey as it is, but i love it  anyway</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I ruined so many trying to use this palette.  </li>
            <li> The Z Palette is changing how we store make up for the better.</li>
            <li> I have never travelled with it, it mostly sits on my makeup desk and gets used maybe once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the size.  </li>
            <li> I look more organized</li>
            <li> notice that it&#x27;s not the most durable product</li>
            <li> So convenient, would&#x27;ve gotten more stars if the magnets were stronger.</li>
            <li> Most of my make up was already magnetic</li>
            <li> It is made of recyclable materials, but it sure feels sturdy.  </li>
            <li> It is an actual Z Palette brand and came in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> So glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> I wanted a palette that offered more freedom</li>
            <li> I was able to depot it all</li>
            <li> and it all fit!</li>
            <li> I love my Z Palettes.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my Z Palette.</li>
            <li> I just keep wanting more</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> And I love that it comes with magnets for the pots that aren&#x27;t magnetized.</li>
            <li> I love all the color and pattern choices it comes</li>
            <li> Just have to get more palettes to finish them all.</li>
            <li> That makes it even better.</li>
            <li> I found cheaper alternatives to the Z palette, such as magnetic craft boxes, but the design of the Z palette is perfect for makeup application.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s able to keep all of her shadows in here and with lots of room to add more shadows.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I have more space in my stash now.</li>
            <li> Love having all my depotted shadows in one place.</li>
            <li> I love this pallet better than the MAC pro pallet (which i also have).</li>
            <li> This palette seems more lightweight than the others I ordered before.</li>
            <li> It has made my eye make up area more organized</li>
            <li> so I was worried they wouldn&#x27;t fit in the palette, but they do!</li>
            <li> I love it for traveling, which I do a lot.</li>
            <li> Love thiS</li>
            <li> I love this palette.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m able to see the colors that I don&#x27;t use often.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying some magnet tape at Michael&#x27;s, which has a much tackier/stickier backing and works great</li>
            <li> Perfect for de-potting some Urban Decay Shadows.  </li>
            <li> I like the window on the top</li>
            <li> Love this palette</li>
            <li> it just helps me keep my makeup more organized</li>
            <li> and I reach more for colors</li>
            <li> Lol it helps organize your makeup very well.</li>
            <li> I wish the larger palettes came in more colors, but the Z palette is just the best thing ever.</li>
            <li> I have the official MK Compact Pro but wanted something that made better use of the space.</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> I love that the palettes also come with adhesive metal disks to help with non-magnetic pans.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love them for my pressed shadows.</li>
            <li> I have so much more room in my makeup area now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute and practical.</li>
            <li> and i love it.</li>
            <li> but I plan to buy more</li>
            <li> Will definitely purchase more!!!</li>
            <li> Very worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my absolute favorite thing that I own!</li>
            <li> Super convenient to be able to personalize everything you need/want into one place!</li>
            <li> My favorite uses for them are making custom palettes, and to condense bulkier palettes into something more easily to store.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it claims, good quality.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re very careful, I&#x27;m sure you can keep everything in great shape, but it&#x27;s a fair warning to be patient when depotting shadows and things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so easy it even helped me get inspired and use more colors that I used to do in one</li>
            <li> Most powder makeup products can be de-potted easily (check youtube for tutorials).</li>
            <li> The material is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> works perfectly for all the loose blushes or shadows a have depotted.</li>
            <li> These hold the pans securely and are better than I imagined.</li>
            <li> I used to use Mac Palettes since I use their shadows a lot, but they don&#x27;t offer all of these features and didn&#x27;t fit as many.</li>
            <li> These empty palettes are the best.</li>
            <li> when I finally received it &amp; transferred my favorite eyeshadows, I feel more organized &amp; happy.</li>
            <li> perfect, just as expected</li>
            <li> I feel they are more secure in the MAC Palette.</li>
            <li> Very slim... good find</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy and easy to clean!</li>
            <li> and if you think it&#x27;s a bummer dropping one of your compacts, try dropping a z-palette full!  </li>
            <li> Now my gf has some of all her make up in this palette, and no need to have a bag full of lil make up containers !</li>
            <li> so it makes it super easy when de-potting my shadows!</li>
            <li> I picked up my first Z-Palette at IMATS NY 2013 and immediately fell in love!</li>
            <li> The magnetic bottom of the Z-Palette is super strong so my shadows don&#x27;t move around, but I can take them out and rearrange them with ease!</li>
            <li> On the other hand, the Z Palette would be perfect for eyeshadows like Makeup Geek.  </li>
            <li> It was easy and it came with directions.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great because I was able to add different size eyeshadows and even blushes.</li>
            <li> It makes it easy to change out eyeshadows</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to change them around.</li>
            <li> So easy to use.</li>
            <li> They r easy to find</li>
            <li> the colors is easy but the colors stay where you put them.</li>
            <li> The magnet is strong it fits a lot</li>
            <li> and it is still going strong</li>
            <li> so you can see your products and the strong magnet.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t bother tryung to dupe unless you have some strong magnets and are building it</li>
            <li> This is my first Z palette and I must say that I am loving it.</li>
            <li> ,I feel super organized now!</li>
            <li> It looks very pretty!</li>
            <li> Love my purchase and fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t have one yet GET IT, then giggle at how your huge set of make up</li>
            <li> It feels sturdy and secure and I have not had any issues with it.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic,  z palatte😃</li>
            <li> It really is a great thing to have if you want to have a variety of colors on hand, rather than looking through all you individual eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li> You can fit both products in the palette and it minimizes the amount that you need to carry.</li>
            <li> Rugged and fantastic quality.</li>
            <li> Totally secure.</li>
            <li> So I just attached the included magnets to the bottom of the MAC shadows and now they are just as secure.</li>
            <li> Great product however only fit 27 morphe brushes eyeshadows whereas on the morphe brushes website it claimed to fit 28.</li>
            <li> Great Help For a Family of 6 with extra to spare</li>
            <li> I primarily use the z palettes to hold my eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a great size, especially for traveling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great that you can put different size products in it as well.</li>
            <li> Great if you have several palettes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a puzzle but they will fit and once placed</li>
            <li> 25ct magnetic pans (available on Amazon for cheap!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;See through lid is great so I don&#x27;t have to open it to see what colors I&#x27;d like to</li>
            <li> Smaller ones great for travel too.</li>
            <li> Overall, great product.</li>
            <li> saved all my MAC containers and will be turning them in for free products.</li>
            <li> and honestly it&#x27;s too much work in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> i suppose you could secure it with a ghetto rubberband.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect because for me a perfect would be handmade by a loved one.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t like the disk being larger than the shadow pan), and a price reduction (just because I love a good bargain).</li>
            <li> It holds more than I have right now</li>
            <li> None of my other palettes are able to do this and it has been a great thing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The bottom magnet isn&#x27;t super strong so changing out</li>
            <li> high quality with a nice magnetic surface.  </li>
            <li> Filled it up right away!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure of the exact size on these palettes</li>
            <li> They declutter your makeup and honestly the palettes remind you of colors you Dont normally use.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money!</li>
            <li> De-potting can be a bit of work, so be sure to watch some tutorials first.</li>
            <li> This palette is exactly what I was looking for because I needed to have an easier way to access my favorite makeup.</li>
            <li> I am having so much fun customizing my pallet!</li>
            <li> Extremely useful product!</li>
            <li> Hundreds of dollars worth of eyeshadows were ruined!</li>
            <li> The hardest thing is, is fitting the shadows in the pallet to make them look pretty.</li>
            <li> Before I bought this, I decided to do a &amp;#34;DIY Z Palette&amp;#34; and I was so excited to make one</li>
            <li> and I would be willing to buy this again to use for more shadows as I get them.</li>
            <li> So much fun to add my pans to the palette and have them all organized and in one place!  </li>
            <li> it saved so much space in my makeup storage and makes an easy access!</li>
            <li> allowed me to clean up my bathroom/makeup area</li>
            <li> Also love the clear top.</li>
            <li> Love that you can see what colors you have through the clear top, and that it comes with adhesive discs so that you can depot your product and use a disc to magnetize it to the pallett.</li>
            <li> I love the clear top</li>
            <li> My zpalette came fast and loved it so much</li>
            <li> I can honestly say my collection wouldn&#x27;t be complete without them!</li>
            <li> This softened the glue pretty well and most popped out pretty easily.</li>
            <li> The clear window on the front is also really nice</li>
            <li> Overall, I am content with this product, and I think that it was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Z Palette has received such good reviews, both from gurus and reviewers, so I have to imagine that my experience is probably just a one-off, but I thought I would share it</li>
            <li> very recommendable if you want to organize your makeup more efficiently.  </li>
            <li> Removing the one and two from the billions of palettes i have make it some much easier to find the colors i love.</li>
            <li> I bought this palette to hold some eyeshadows that were taking up too much room and this palette holds all 15 of them with room for more.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Z palette and after an evening with a candle, screwdriver and all of my potted makeup, I soon had a full Z palette of unpotted makeup.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems to be sturdy, but take good care of it like anything else and it will last.</li>
            <li> You can easily arrange how you want the colors and fit over 20 MAC shadows in one large Z Palette.</li>
            <li> i love clear lid which makes it easy for me to see what shadows are in what pallet.</li>
            <li> The closure on these is very nice although if traveling I would recommend putting it under clothes in a suitcase to keep it closed.</li>
            <li> Its also great for depotting other eyeshadows to declutter your stash…</li>
            <li> this is a great thing way to store blushes, powders, and any other types of makeup that comes in pans.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very travel friendly!</li>
            <li> and I love being able to see my products without having to open it.</li>
            <li> Love it would buy more in the future</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and just as described.  </li>
            <li> I also had to super glue a couple magnets to the product.</li>
            <li> Overall, great idea and very sturdy design.</li>
            <li> All MK products are magnetic and they fit exactly.</li>
            <li> The palette itself is very light and easy to open</li>
            <li> The black is sleek and the magnetic closure is great.  </li>
            <li> This is the first z palette I&#x27;ve ever gotten, and it&#x27;s so much fun!  </li>
            <li> This is my first empty palette of any sort, but so far I&#x27;m very happy.  </li>
            <li> and I will definitely continue to buy more Z Palettes!</li>
            <li> More room!&lt;br /&gt;The magnetic back is really strong.</li>
            <li> Love that I was able to consolidate all of my single shadows into one spot.</li>
            <li> And my prayers were answered when I got it yesterday with not cracks and with the sticky magnets and bonus magnets is came packaged very well and SUPER FAST!!!</li>
            <li> My large one fit 2 blushes, 1 bronzer, 1 pressed powder, and about 12 eye-shadows.  </li>
            <li> The lid also has a light magnetic closure to keep it from flying open and has a translucent window to see inside which is great if you have multiple of these..</li>
            <li> Very slim profile, but not too cheap feeling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The magnetic lid is amazing and it stays shut to matter what happens (unless you open it, of course).</li>
            <li> so I could use them more frequently.</li>
            <li> Make sure you cover the pot completely or it will break while releasing it.  </li>
            <li> A couple of my shadows got fractured in the process, but it was still worth it.  </li>
            <li> It is 100% worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I rarely ever use it.</li>
            <li> really well - one has been on multiple 1000+ mile road trips and looks just as good as the one that stays at home.</li>
            <li> I love the design of it with the clear plastic</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for design or it being colorful or girlie.</li>
            <li> The slim design will also useful for traveling.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I did think it was going to be a bit bigger to be honest</li>
            <li> Nice palette but such a hassle having to put glue on the magnets they supposedly come with it but doesnt work!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for the true makeup collector!</li>
            <li> I got this pretty quickly even though I ordered it on a holiday weekend.</li>
            <li> The small square magnets fit perfect on Urban Decay shadows and Nars.</li>
            <li> Its pretty sturdy, but I do wish they would make a palette that is not made out of cardboard.. but overall, still a nice product.</li>
            <li> Instead, I popped my shadows out of their primary case if I could and put them under my blow dryer on high for a minute and pried them out with a metal makeup spatula.</li>
            <li> great, comes in many colors, thin, light weight, durable (so far), saved me lots of space.</li>
            <li> Holds so many more eyeshadow pots than my old MAC palettes, that finally wore out and broke.</li>
            <li> The large really doesn&#x27;t fit a lot of eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> It is a simple and easy way to put your makeup in one palette without having to worry about pre-cut shapes!</li>
            <li> The large size held all my makeup!</li>
            <li> I have had mine for a few months now, and even after daily use, it keeps up great!  </li>
            <li> This palette comes with nickel size round magnets (perfectly fits MAC eyeshadows) and smaller square magnets.</li>
            <li> so I just ordered a new one and prayed it came not cracked!!!</li>
            <li> It really is handy for all your single eyeshadows and blushes or whatever else</li>
            <li> I received it very fast.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product and concept, even though I am sure it is not original to Z palette.</li>
            <li> I am now planning to order several more</li>
            <li> looks &amp;#34;normal.&amp;#34;  ;)</li>
            <li> so glad I finally got this z palette!</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s the only thing they could do better.  </li>
            <li> You can stick so many different things in there.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Looks exactly like online pictures.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a makeup artist and this helps so much with saving space!</li>
            <li> this saves so much space!</li>
            <li> It definitely feels cheap!  </li>
            <li> THANKS!</li>
            <li> Macs palette is 16 dollars and hold 15, and MUFE sells their palette for $20 and only holds 10, and here you can just throw what you&#x27;ve got, whatever size, and it&#x27;ll hold a lot more.  </li>
            <li> I love my z palette, the only thing was most of my shadows didnt have the proper metal to stick to the magnet</li>
            <li> I know you can purchase more, but that seems like a rip off to me, they should include enough to fully use the palette</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s magnetic and can hold  many colors and in different sizes.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, spacious, exactly as described.</li>
            <li> It was my first time trying this out for myself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a makeup artists and these were very helpful!</li>
            <li> With this you create exactly what you want.  </li>
            <li> and now I use more of the makeup i already had, because I can finally see it all!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I decided to buy one because I&#x27;ve used MAC palettes for years since I first started getting into makeup.</li>
            <li> Z Palettes are the way to go and they really have helped me utilize all of the makeup that I have and not foret about them stored in some drawer!</li>
            <li> Exactly what it is...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many times to consolidate palettes, finally some one made one!  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Very convenient!</li>
            <li> I bought my first Z Palette and depotted all of my MAC eyeshadows into it.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> pretty close.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall I love it</li>
            <li> I had to glue the magnet to the shadow, other than that I love it!</li>
            <li> Not only do I have more space</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and worth the money.</li>
            <li> and I love the different prints you can pick out also!</li>
            <li> &amp; they look so pretty together.</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> Z Palettes are an absolute must have for anyone who loves, wears, or owns any makeup!</li>
            <li> The Z palette is nice and works as expected.  </li>
            <li> I mostly depotted an Urban Decay book of shadows hoping to save space.  </li>
            <li> The Z palette would be advantageous if you wanted to put both eyeshadows and blushes on the same palette, then the Z palette would be much better.</li>
            <li> mine was a blue black and super great quality.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased my first and was able to organize a large amount of my eyeshadows into one palette.</li>
            <li> While, I did consolidate products and clear up space in my make-up collection, I broke some products trying to pry them out of original containers.</li>
            <li> Completely environmentally friendly.</li>
            <li> specific palette is not the domed one--you most likely won&#x27;t be able to place your baked shadows (or as I tried, bronzers and blush) into this particular one.</li>
            <li> It seems to be better quality than my Leopard print Z Palette which is strange</li>
            <li> so I thought this small sample size would be a good way to try these products</li>
            <li> It makes it so easy to take on trips and select only the ones you need.  </li>
            <li> I loved the concept, but the GlamRX is too small to hold much of anything.</li>
            <li> I have all my shadows in 2 large Z palettes now.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for when I travel and do not want to take all my palettes with me but certain colors.  </li>
            <li> Does not look large at all but works well and does the job.</li>
            <li> I purchased the large pallet (not for traveling)</li>
            <li> I purchased a few more Z-palettes to use with ALL my makeup!</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about getting one these from a few reviews I read, but I think its perfect for what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Easy peasy with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> These work really well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sleek and well made.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a makeup artist and have  a sooooo much stuff.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s cardboard, but I see this holding up very well to it purpose- keeping my b-string, horse show makeup in one thingy, instead of chasing around a dozen separate compacts.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this seller for ZPalettes!</li>
            <li> Made things SO much easier for me and plan on ordering another one soon.</li>
            <li> Now the ones I really like and need are in one place.</li>
            <li> My shadows and blushes feel secure and I&#x27;ll save money in the future by buying shadows in pan form.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very durable.</li>
            <li> Makeup packaging takes up so much room and these palettes allow you to de-pot and save a lot of space.</li>
            <li> This thing is literally falling apart on me and the real kicker?</li>
            <li> , you&#x27;ll need to be gentle with it.</li>
            <li> Very practical</li>
            <li> Works better than I expected it to.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> you fill the whole palette</li>
            <li> Very sturdy.</li>
            <li> All my individual eye shadows fit into this case.</li>
            <li> but it has held up really well.</li>
            <li> recommend you purchase a stainless steel cosmetic spatula to help with the de-potting process so that you don&#x27;t ruin your makeup</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper than buying an empty MAC palette and much more convenient.</li>
            <li> The design of the whole pallet is slim and doesn&#x27;t take up allot of room.</li>
            <li> Makes it so much easier having all my eyeshadows in one place.</li>
            <li> It is really convenient to have all of my favorites in one palette.</li>
            <li> Also, for this price, I really don&#x27;t feel like I can complain too much.  </li>
            <li> Also, for this price, I really don&#x27;t feel like I can complain too much.  </li>
            <li> The Z Palettes are much sturdier too.</li>
            <li> They have held up reasonably well and kept my makeup protected.</li>
            <li> but I really really like it.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve really helped me condense my makeup collection.</li>
            <li> Even though they are made of cardboard with a plastic window, they are really sturdy.</li>
            <li> It has saved me so much room in my makeup collection</li>
            <li> I really like having all my makeup in ONE container with a window.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard so much about these palettes and when my makeup collection exceeded their space</li>
            <li> that being said, still very sturdy well built product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like this...</li>
            <li> and this really did the trick combining</li>
            <li> My matte Urban Decay shadows did NOT like this at all and most cracked which I fixed with rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> other great thing about this palette is that you can flip the cover over completely to the opposite side and hold the palette in one hand when using it.  </li>
            <li> The only tricky part can be getting the shadows out of their original containers, but I found that an xacto knife, and some rubbing alcohol (to loosen / dissolve the glue)</li>
            <li> Better than expected!</li>
            <li> I had purchased a special palette from urban decay but it came in a cardboard box and was very bulky and cumbersome.</li>
            <li> It really helped me declutter - all my older makeup is now in one place.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having this palette made it easy for me to depot my single ones and put them all in one place.</li>
            <li> It was large enough to fit all of my single eye shadows in and I still have room for more and extra magnets.</li>
            <li> This palette came with a small baggie full of circle and square magnet stickers, so the eye shadows I had that didn&#x27;t have any glue left on them or weren&#x27;t already magnetic are super easy to convert</li>
            <li> I love the little metal stickers that comes with it, it secures my shadows very securely.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> so I am completely confident my expensive shadows are safe</li>
            <li> Although I love this Z palettes and this is my second purchase I have had the same problem with this twice already.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, and larger than I had expected, which is nice.</li>
            <li> Most likely will get my 2nd palette soon.</li>
            <li> I definitely have used my BoS shadows more recently because of the fact that I can immediately see the shadows through the lid and don&#x27;t have to fuss with UD&#x27;s packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I can really nudge them in the corners and right next to each</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I highly recommend a zpalette if you want to depot any of your makeup and save some space.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly unrecommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to all of my MUA friends and everyone that wears makeup.</li>
            <li> I love that it came with little magnets in case your shadows aren&#x27;t magnetic.</li>
            <li> I love that little magnets are provided.  </li>
            <li> I wish it was just a little more sleek though</li>
            <li> so I tried to make the best out of a bad situation I coved the palette with zebra duck tape and used it</li>
            <li> These palettes are great for organizing random shadows and saving room in your kit.</li>
            <li> I was worried that the clear window would be too flimsy, but it&#x27;s much sturdier than I thought and hasn&#x27;t been a problem.</li>
            <li> Saves space since I pressed my Concrete Minerals and Shiro Cosmetics shadows, and my depotted NYX shadows.</li>
            <li> and i find that Im using things i normally didnt reach for.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this palette if you are looking to de-clutter and free up space on your vanity or other makeup storage area.</li>
            <li> Not only can you instantly see what is inside, the lid flips underneath completely, so it is easy to hold while applying makeup.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Magnet in the back feels strong enough to keep my things in place (however, I wouldn&#x27;t be throwing this thing around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the large one holds about 20 and the extra large holds about 27</li>
            <li> Unit slides right into my make up bag which hangs on the back of the bathroom door.</li>
            <li> Right now I only have my Inglot shadows in it</li>
            <li> and I plan on getting a few more plus a small one more for day to day carry around.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a must-have for anyone looking to make their collection a little more professional and streamlined.  </li>
            <li> and it still feels like new.</li>
            <li> It looks brand new in the morning.</li>
            <li> fits my new shadows</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new, just stick the magnetic stickers to your pans and set them in the Z-Palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want something this big, TKB trading has a smaller one that&#x27;s really cheap and people tend to like it.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first because of some other reviews I saw mentioned that this one was made of cardboard and there were other brands out there that did not use cardboard but a more sturdier plastic.  </li>
            <li> Not my first Z Palette and definitely not my last.</li>
            <li> I have tried several of the empty magnetic palettes and this one is my favorite by far.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest having pure acetone to remove the glue residue off the back.</li>
            <li> Were smaller than I expected so I was glad that I bought the extra large as well.</li>
            <li> so I worry a little about how long it will hold up, but for now it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s easily fixed with new ones from a hardware or craft store.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe I just got a lemon, but for half the price I can get one of the new palettes from MAC and they are infinitely better quality (actual plastic rather than plastic-coated cardboard!).</li>
            <li> If it was about half an inch taller, it would fit 28</li>
            <li> This is my second large z palette</li>
            <li> The clear window lets you see what&#x27;s inside, and the lid flips under</li>
            <li> The only thing I dont like is the stickers that come with it dont really stick.</li>
            <li> Overall though I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I anticipated a flimsy front cover, but was pleasantly surprised to find a sturdy piece of plastic.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want to go through the whole process of sending it back</li>
            <li> While I wish it weren&#x27;t so much work to depot the shadows, I will definitely purchase this product again to condense my makeup collection.</li>
            <li> only issue is that makeup (shadow or blush) that is domed us too high for the lid to shut!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing make up professionally for 10 years and this palette is genius.</li>
            <li> Also very affordable and comes in different colours and sizes.</li>
            <li> but so far I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Some pans are naturally compatible with the Z Palette&#x27;s magnets and some aren&#x27;t, so</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m surprised this wasn&#x27;t taken into account during the design process.</li>
            <li> I buy a lot of individual pans of eye shadows and blushes and this palette keeps everything looking very neat and organized.</li>
            <li> n wild shadows into these.</li>
            <li> But I much prefer these to the Uniis because you can actually see what&#x27;s inside.</li>
            <li> I love the Z Palette, and I have a few in different colors.</li>
            <li> I took all my bulky and broken blush and eye shadow containers and depotted the metal trays by setting them on my warm straightener on a piece of wax paper to protect them.</li>
            <li> It was also large enough to fit my Naked palette in along with other items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My first impression was that it was heavy, I expected it to be somewhat light and flimsy, but that was not the case.  </li>
            <li> It love how much it cut down on excess packaging, the included magnets are pretty weak and I put extras on the items that needed them.</li>
            <li> As a result, one of the eyeshadows (the darkest one no less) broke, ruining the case and all the colors within.</li>
            <li> (Plus, you can &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34; a fractured shadow back together with some rubbing alcohol and a bit of light pressing down).</li>
            <li> I never traveled with, or kept the palettes in a high humidity area such as a bathroom.</li>
            <li> along with 3 single mac shadows that i had laying around; i rarely use my naked palettes but when I organized them here ive been using this alot!</li>
            <li> the round magnets fit MAC shadows and larger blushes.</li>
            <li> I have no other palettes to compare this to, though.  </li>
            <li> If you have some cosmetics that are rounded on top, they may not fit!!!</li>
            <li> heard there are a lot of fake z palettes on amazon, I highly doubt this is fake but even if it is its a great product and worth the $.</li>
            <li> Much sturdier than I expected....</li>
            <li> When you purchase a pallet that is already full of shadows and blushes there is usually around 1\4 of the colors that you will never use.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so hard to get the makeup out of the original packaging.  </li>
            <li> few things that I would love to see in the future: a larger palette size (the pro size isn&#x27;t much bigger than the large), smaller adhesive metal disks for small shadows</li>
            <li> seriously, once I was done with the messy part... I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> The only downside is that getting your makeup OUT of its ORIGINAL cases is really hard.</li>
            <li> I bought my Z Palette directly from the manufacturer after collecting so many random eyeshadow samples and individual pots that I wanted to depot</li>
            <li> I did save space, but not sure the effort is worth it.</li>
            <li> The only con is that there seems to be a warp on the lid so that it doesn&#x27;t close exactly as it should unless you give it a little push.</li>
            <li> black Z-Palette looks very sleek.  </li>
            <li> A lot harder to get the pots out at first than expected</li>
            <li> go ahead and spend a little more for the hard plastic case of the UNII.</li>
            <li> I felt like it was just such a waste that I wasn&#x27;t using the shadows because of Urban Decay&#x27;s frivolous packaging, so I decided to invest in this Large Z Palette.</li>
            <li> I had a whole bunch of small little palette that I don&#x27;t use since I forget I have certain colors.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s definitely worth getting this one over the small one !</li>
            <li> so I went ahead and ordered the large and it is more than enough for all my random small sized drugstore eye shadows.</li>
            <li> I currently have 5 large Z Palettes and 2 small ones.</li>
            <li> It flat enough I can even slide it into my purse for those days when I need to go day to night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having some problems with a few of my de-potted shadows with adhesive not sticking very well, all this despite extensively cleaning the back prior to careful application.</li>
            <li> Seriously, if you want to condense your shadows and powders, buy this right now.</li>
            <li> but when i buy palettes i usually use one or two in the whole collection.</li>
            <li> They are pretty thick</li>
            <li> Keep the curling iron onthe old one until it frees the pot then release it with your hands on it as your turn it upside down .  </li>
            <li> Which is flat!</li>
            <li> I bought one of these to store my MUG and Urban Decay single eye shadows.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing another z palette to store the rest of my single eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> Also, it is a little hard to keep clean.</li>
            <li> the glue gets loose and a thin knife can slide in and pop the metal trays of product out quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not poorly made or shoddy at all.  </li>
            <li> We all know how bulky and inconvenient most eyeshadow palettes are, and this fixes all of that.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting one of these for so long and when I saw this price I couldn&#x27;t pass it up.</li>
            <li> Much bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had mine for too long</li>
            <li> I was smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> This product worked like a charm as long as I kept it at home.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I was going on vacation and didn&#x27;t want to drag 15 different eyeshadow pans with me.</li>
            <li> The pallet was smaller than i expected.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it too long</li>
            <li> I depot all my urban decay, too faced and wet</li>
            <li> palette is very durable, sturdy, and made from a thick cardboard.</li>
            <li> Definitely has helped clear up clutter on my vanity and would recommend this size if you travel a lot but can&#x27;t seem to dial down and only bring a few things.</li>
            <li> may also want to use some &amp;#34;Goo Gone&amp;#34; or solvent to remove the glue on the bottom of the metal trays before putting them on the palette, or you&#x27;ll just be giving yourself a huge gluey mess for the</li>
            <li> But in the end, I needed a larger palette than the other plastic ones I purchased, so I bought this one</li>
            <li> It only took about 3 days and came with my other purchases.</li>
            <li> Oh and be careful using a flat iron to loosen it up off the box because the plastic can melt.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I haven&#x27;t purchased something like this a long time ago!</li>
            <li> I also have a large cheetah, two small black ones, and a pro size on order.</li>
            <li> Only down fall is that it only holds 27 standard round shadows and the palette I was depotting came with 28</li>
            <li> I purchased these to get rid of bulky packaging ( I&#x27;m looking at you UD) and condense my single products</li>
            <li> i use it every single day.</li>
            <li> I use this z palette to hold my single eye shadows.</li>
            <li> I had a lot of single eyeshadows that I kept in a makeup bag</li>
            <li> need to get another one to finish depotting my single makeup products.</li>
            <li> and I use it every single day.</li>
            <li> Amazon had the large for the same price as the small size retails for normally, I&#x27;m not sure if it was a glitch or a flash sale type of thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a bunch of NYX single eyeshadwos taking up a lot of space in my drawer.</li>
            <li> I have about 20 eyeshadows in there, 16 from the BoS, and a couple of single pots I had around, along with a powder).  </li>
            <li> I expected this product to be a little bit bigger, but overall it does the job.</li>
            <li> I had a lot of old small shadow packages with some of the shadows already used, but with some still there.</li>
            <li> I had a bunch (like 50) loose pans</li>
            <li> I can turn the palette upside down and wiggle with the lid open and nothing even moves</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it for Mac eyeshadows but it will hold less than 40 shadows because the pans are bigger in size.&lt;br</li>
            <li> personally prefer something with a snap closure, but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s possible</li>
            <li> personally prefer something with a snap closure, but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s possible</li>
            <li> (there are many magnets included in the packaging--both small square and round): it&#x27;s not great.</li>
            <li> Although this one was &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34; i know it would only handle so much jostling in my bag before it broke down, or worse, would have exploded makeup all over.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy, sleek and has a magnetic closure that holds closed when traveling.</li>
            <li> Sturdier than I expected.</li>
            <li> It can hold 34 standard round shadows: 4 rows of 7 pots and the bottom row of 6 staggered.</li>
            <li> , they kept falling off the back of my eyeshadow, on the few I had to use it on.</li>
            <li> They hold a lot of product and the magnetic lid ensures that it stays closed when on the go traveling.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> Received as expected.</li>
            <li> it comes in a wide variety of colors and sizes</li>
            <li> The adhesive is very weak and slides right off.</li>
            <li> palette comes with the little magnetic stickers in different shapes and sizes for your aluminum pans, pried out from other sources, but I also use it with myomakeup.com</li>
            <li> This palette was just what I expected!</li>
            <li> You have to be careful!</li>
            <li> So I took the shadows out and put them in the z pallete along with some other shadows.</li>
            <li> so I could depot all of my drugstore and other brand eyeshadows and depot a MAC blush.</li>
            <li> You can also depot other eyeshadows (for example, I put my Mary Kay shadows in there as well).</li>
            <li> I keep eyeshadows in one and blushes, highlighter, and bronzer in the other.</li>
            <li> If you have a lot of individual colors, you may find this product to be too small.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to get my small one for travel to take only essentials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you break up your powders add a little rubbing alcohol in and let it dry.</li>
            <li> I know that&#x27;s a little nit picky, but I love keeping my makeup products wiped down, and the base of the pallette likes to hold on to the extra powder/product that comes off the brushes.</li>
            <li> 20 single little containers.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> It came with magnetized base and very light weight.</li>
            <li> I wish this was hard plastic, so until I&#x27;ve had it a year to see if it disintegrates, only 4 stars.</li>
            <li> was wary of putting my eye shadows in the oven to get them out of their packaging, but it really worked and nothing got burned.</li>
            <li> After seriously purchasing and trying 3 other brands of palettes, I finally gave in an purchased this one.  </li>
            <li> The MAC ones clung but it was much weaker and I was definitely afraid they would come loose if I travelled with the palette.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the mac ones because there too bulky and he magnet is not very strong:</li>
            <li> I have the leopard print and now black.</li>
            <li> thing I have noticed, which is the reason I give the Z Palette a four star rating, is that my Hoola bronzer is slightly too tall for the palette and has caused the plexi to crack around the edges of the pan.</li>
            <li> I have the pink one but am looking into getting a small peacock or leopard print one for lipstick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still cleaning up from the mess, trying to salvage what I can.</li>
            <li> The only thing I dislike (this is nothing the manufacturer can change) is how hard it is to depot some shadows!</li>
            <li> only hard part (unrelated to the product) is getting my eye shadows de-potted!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Included is a little how to for pan removal.</li>
            <li> little depotting hint.</li>
            <li> A little cheaper to buy it on amazon.</li>
            <li> Still magnetized and comes with little magnets.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy but maybe a little pricey depending on where you purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two of these palettes for a little over a year.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a grreat product but a little overpriced.</li>
            <li> Came with little round and square magnets for those pots you have without a magnetic pan.</li>
            <li> These worked well, but I wish there were two sizes for the round magnets.</li>
            <li> It get messy in there....</li>
            <li> I used it for a few blushes and some eyeshadows</li>
            <li> I decided to depot a few my eyeshadows</li>
            <li> My Lancome colors (which already have a magnetized base) survived the trip, but all my other shadows, including the MAC shadows (without the magnetized base, only the provided magnets) did not stay put (you have to use your own glue).</li>
            <li> It even came with little magnets to attach to non-magnetic pans!</li>
            <li> I would also recommend buying the small palette for traveling.</li>
            <li> No more searching for colors.</li>
            <li> Included with the palette is a small how-to card for pressing powders, but you can find YouTube videos too for that if you need it.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I wish I never depotted all my eyeshadows to have them in a palette that didn&#x27;t end up lasting.</li>
            <li> It has allowed me to organize my makeup and do away with a million small compacts.</li>
            <li> I usually have eye shadows in one, blushes in another, etc.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of indivdual pieces at this time, but when I increase my product, this palette will be too small.  </li>
            <li> This should be called a small.</li>
            <li> I even bought a small one for travel.</li>
            <li> After around a year of use a thin layer of plastic started peeling off the black cardboard material.</li>
            <li> Much smaller than expected, disappointed.</li>
            <li> The hard part is de-potting your eyeshadows and blushes.</li>
            <li> Several people have described these palettes as questionable for travel with the poorly constructed front cover, but I have to disagree.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that is a common thing with those</li>
            <li> I would still give this 5 stars just for the space it&#x27;s saved me in my drawer, and because I&#x27;m a sucker for organization.  </li>
            <li> I could probably have 30 of the eye shadows and 9 blushes at least.</li>
            <li> No more need for dozens of separate eyeshadow cases!  </li>
            <li> It seemed to me that the cheaper the brand the easier it was to remove, but for example my Clinique stuff broke because it is seriously glued in.</li>
            <li> I keep all my loose shadows in it and don&#x27;t have to worry about them getting busted, lost, or dirty.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use any of the methods that came on the instruction card because they seemed a little too complicated (oven, flattening iron).</li>
            <li> The plastic (or glass) front is very thick.</li>
            <li> It is thin, sleek and can hold about 20-22 MAC sized eye shadows.</li>
            <li> I can imagine this getting dirty and damaged because I have already had some trouble removing makeup from it.</li>
            <li> came in broken, and didn&#x27;t come with the magnetic stickers like the post claims.</li>
            <li> If I try something else out and hate it, I&#x27;d definitely bump this up to 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Within two months the magnet base bowed so now everything inside is on a slight slope.</li>
            <li> I thought that the eyeshadows are already magnetic, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my products did not survive baggage handling at the airport.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with these z palettes!</li>
            <li> I was shocked how well the MUG pans attached to the bottom of the palette.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It was tragic.  </li>
            <li> maybe i&#x27;m retarded</li>
            <li> /&gt;Within a month, the plastic/cardboard sides that hold the makeup in place separated from the base.</li>
            <li> but it was annoying in the morning to always sift thru the containers to find the ones I was looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> returning it and am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I would always ignore my Book of Shadows and use cheaper quads from the drugstore just because the BoS packaging was so bulky and terrible.</li>
            <li> Worst part is depotting.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am loving this product so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure of the exact size on these palettes so I went ahead and ordered the large and it is more than enough for all my random small sized drugstore eye shadows. It was also large enough to fit my Naked palette in along with other items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This palette is very durable, sturdy, and made from a thick cardboard. The clear window on the front is also really nice so I can simply glance to see which products I have stored in this palette without having to open it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this palette if you are looking to de-clutter and free up space on your vanity or other makeup storage area.</li>
            <li> Great for holding my MAC shadows...  the large one holds about 20 and the extra large holds about 27</li>
            <li> I love my zpalettes. I have 6 total. They declutter your makeup and honestly the palettes remind you of colors you Dont normally use. Totally worth the money!</li>
            <li> After seriously purchasing and trying 3 other brands of palettes, I finally gave in an purchased this one.  I was hesitant at first because of some other reviews I saw mentioned that this one was made of cardboard and there were other brands out there that did not use cardboard but a more sturdier plastic.  But in the end, I needed a larger palette than the other plastic ones I purchased, so I bought this one and I am in love with it!  It&#x27;s quality is great, I have no issues with it.  It&#x27;s not poorly made or shoddy at all.  It feels sturdy and secure and I have not had any issues with it.  I travel a lot and though I take care of my palette when I travel, I don&#x27;t just throw it around or put it in checked luggage, I haven&#x27;t had any incidents at all.  I love the little metal stickers that comes with it, it secures my shadows very securely.&lt;br /&gt;The other great thing about this palette is that you can flip the cover over completely to the opposite side and hold the palette in one hand when using it.  None of my other palettes are able to do this and it has been a great thing.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this!</li>
            <li> I bought one of these to store my MUG and Urban Decay single eye shadows.  I LOVE it! I am now planning to order several more so I can depot ALL of my shadows and blushes!</li>
            <li> The magnet is strong it fits a lot it&#x27;s great. 4 stars not 5 because I thought it was bigger then it is</li>
            <li> I love my z palettes! It&#x27;s a great way to keep all of my shadows and blushes together. The only thing I dont like is the stickers that come with it dont really stick.</li>
            <li> I love the z palette cause you can customize any way you want.  You can put your favorite eyeshadow, blushes, and many more. When you travel you do not want to bring all different palette.  Now you can just bring your favorite colors.</li>
            <li> Not my first Z Palette and definitely not my last. As a makeup artist I love these things to no end. The magnets work great and I&#x27;ve been working with my Z Palette for 2 years now and there are no signs of wear. The material is very easy to clean. The palette itself is very light and easy to open and I love being able to see my products without having to open it.</li>
            <li> I purchased these to get rid of bulky packaging ( I&#x27;m looking at you UD) and condense my single products so I could use them more frequently. These hold the pans securely and are better than I imagined. The small square magnets fit perfect on Urban Decay shadows and Nars. the round magnets fit MAC shadows and larger blushes. I even found that some pans do not need a magnet at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Included is a little how to for pan removal. And of course you can YouTube how to videos as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a makeup artist this has stream lined my kit and allows for me to custom make palettes for jobs. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love it would buy more in the future</li>
            <li> Perfect for makeup artists!</li>
            <li> do not know how i lived without it. if you don&#x27;t have one yet GET IT, then giggle at how your huge set of make up looks &amp;#34;normal.&amp;#34;  ;)</li>
            <li> i use it every single day. i need to get more</li>
            <li> Im so glad I finally got this z palette! It hold SIX of my tarte blushes with room for three stila eye shadows. I will definitely be purchasing another z palette to store the rest of my single eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> heard there are a lot of fake z palettes on amazon, I highly doubt this is fake but even if it is its a great product and worth the $.</li>
            <li> These work really well.</li>
            <li> This palette will hold 27 Makeup Geek shadows.  If it was about half an inch taller, it would fit 28 and that&#x27;s the only thing they could do better.  It&#x27;s sturdy, sleek and has a magnetic closure that holds closed when traveling.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this item. It&#x27;s excellent quality. The magnet on both the lid and the bottom (where the pans stick to) are both very strong. The case is sturdy. The plastic (or glass) front is very thick. Not flimsy at all. It also holds a lot of product. You can stick so many different things in there. I definitely recommend this item. If you don&#x27;t want something this big, TKB trading has a smaller one that&#x27;s really cheap and people tend to like it.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery! Looks exactly like online pictures.</li>
            <li> Received mine today and I love it already. It&#x27;s very sleek and well made. I know it&#x27;s going to be great for my every day use and even to travel with. Only down fall is that it only holds 27 standard round shadows and the palette I was depotting came with 28 so I had to leave one out. Overall though I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> My MAC eyeshadows were taking up a lot of space and this palette has saved me from clutter. It is thin, sleek and can hold about 20-22 MAC sized eye shadows. I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> This came fast and it works great! I&#x27;m a makeup artist and this helps so much with saving space! Highly recommended</li>
            <li> These palettes are great for organizing random shadows and saving room in your kit. Plus there are instructions with different ways to get the colours out of the containers</li>
            <li> I love it!! I&#x27;m a makeup artist and have  a sooooo much stuff.,I feel super organized now! And it is actually way nicer than I thought it would be!</li>
            <li> I love this! I wish I would have ordered the XtraLrg!!!</li>
            <li> Love it!  It really is handy for all your single eyeshadows and blushes or whatever else you want to store.  You can see all your colors that you can use, and honestly I like being able to arrange the colors I like to coordinate together.  Its also great for depotting other eyeshadows to declutter your stash… Its pretty sturdy, but I do wish they would make a palette that is not made out of cardboard.. but overall, still a nice product.</li>
            <li> I had a whole bunch of small little palette that I don&#x27;t use since I forget I have certain colors. I depotted them all and place it in this and now I actually use those eye shadows again.</li>
            <li> Sturdier than I expected. Yes, it&#x27;s cardboard, but I see this holding up very well to it purpose- keeping my b-string, horse show makeup in one thingy, instead of chasing around a dozen separate compacts.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and just as described.  Highly recommend this seller for ZPalettes!</li>
            <li> Went from carrying around nine palettes to fitting seven of those into this z palette. Made things SO much easier for me and plan on ordering another one soon. Recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> This product came in the mail faster than I though. It only took about 3 days and came with my other purchases. It was secure, in good shape. I even got some magnets with my z palette which I will have more within a week.  Thank-you!</li>
            <li> Love this.  A lot harder to get the pots out at first than expected but then you get the hang of it.  Keep the curling iron onthe old one until it frees the pot then release it with your hands on it as your turn it upside down .  Make sure you cover the pot completely or it will break while releasing it.  But I love it.  Now the ones I really like and need are in one place.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting one of these for so long and when I saw this price I couldn&#x27;t pass it up. Came with little round and square magnets for those pots you have without a magnetic pan. Works awesome and love having all of my favorite makeup pans in one palette! Love it!!! Packaged Nicely, Sturdy, Beautiful. Might grab another for my bronzers...</li>
            <li> this saves so much space! i&#x27;ve emptied 3 urban decay naked palettes in here ( two naked2 - one naked1 ) along with 3 single mac shadows that i had laying around; i rarely use my naked palettes but when I organized them here ive been using this alot! it saved so much space in my makeup storage and makes an easy access! i ordered 2 more and they are in the way:)!</li>
            <li> Much bigger than I expected. I anticipated a flimsy front cover, but was pleasantly surprised to find a sturdy piece of plastic. Several people have described these palettes as questionable for travel with the poorly constructed front cover, but I have to disagree. I think this would hold up well.</li>
            <li> I use this z palette to hold my single eye shadows. It can hold 34 standard round shadows: 4 rows of 7 pots and the bottom row of 6 staggered. It&#x27;s super convenient and perfect for traveling.</li>
            <li> I was able to reduce clutter from bulky makeup packaging. My shadows and blushes feel secure and I&#x27;ll save money in the future by buying shadows in pan form.</li>
            <li> This palette was just what I expected! It&#x27;s sturdy and easy to clean! And it holds a lot of eyeshadows!</li>
            <li> I love Z palettes if you have not purchased one before they are great they do the job.</li>
            <li> Love this zpalette!! It&#x27;s perfect to hold all of my eyeshadow pans. It&#x27;s very durable. I&#x27;ve had it for about a year and it still feels like new. I highly recommend a zpalette if you want to depot any of your makeup and save some space. It&#x27;s also very travel friendly!</li>
            <li> These are awesome.  No more need for dozens of separate eyeshadow cases!  I have all my shadows in 2 large Z palettes now.  The only tricky part can be getting the shadows out of their original containers, but I found that an xacto knife, and some rubbing alcohol (to loosen / dissolve the glue) can do a great job.  A couple of my shadows got fractured in the process, but it was still worth it.  (Plus, you can &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34; a fractured shadow back together with some rubbing alcohol and a bit of light pressing down).</li>
            <li> I love my palette, it reduced the space my makeup takes up dramatically. My large one fit 2 blushes, 1 bronzer, 1 pressed powder, and about 12 eye-shadows.  The only downside is that getting your makeup OUT of its ORIGINAL cases is really hard. It seemed to me that the cheaper the brand the easier it was to remove, but for example my Clinique stuff broke because it is seriously glued in. (None of the hints about heating the cases to loosen the glue worked on many brands also) You will need a variety of prying implements and a lot of patience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may also want to use some &amp;#34;Goo Gone&amp;#34; or solvent to remove the glue on the bottom of the metal trays before putting them on the palette, or you&#x27;ll just be giving yourself a huge gluey mess for the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But seriously, once I was done with the messy part... I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Perfect for storage. I would recommend this to anyone looking to save some space. I would also recommend buying the small palette for traveling. One word of caution - if you drop this, your shadows or powder could break or shift. You have to be careful!</li>
            <li> Z palettes are so wonderful. Makeup packaging takes up so much room and these palettes allow you to de-pot and save a lot of space. De-potting can be a bit of work, so be sure to watch some tutorials first. The bottom is magnetic and most makeup pans will be able to stick, but this comes with some metal pieces to affix to the bottom of your pans if they aren&#x27;t magnetic The lid also has a light magnetic closure to keep it from flying open and has a translucent window to see inside which is great if you have multiple of these.. Almost all of my makeup is in Z palettes now!</li>
            <li> Very nice product!  Keep you organized. The entire surface is magnetized. Highly recommended for the true makeup collector! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Fantastic,  z palatte😃</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had mine for too long so I can&#x27;t complain about the palette material. It looks very pretty! I purchased this palette to keep my eyeshadows organized in one place. I thought that the eyeshadows are already magnetic, but I was wrong. You have to remove the eyeshadows from their plastic container and place stick a magnetic circle sticker so that it will stay in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all they look so cute organized in one place! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It definitely feels cheap!  I bought this for when I travel and do not want to take all my palettes with me but certain colors.  It serves it&#x27;s purpose. I think it&#x27;s great for the price &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> The best magnetic palette I&#x27;ve ever bought!!! I don&#x27;t like the mac ones because there too bulky and he magnet is not very strong:( but zpalettes are great the first one I bought was on eBay and it came to me cracked and I didn&#x27;t want to go through the whole process of sending it back so I tried to make the best out of a bad situation I coved the palette with zebra duck tape and used it but I still wanted to see my products so I just ordered a new one and prayed it came not cracked!!! And my prayers were answered when I got it yesterday with not cracks and with the sticky magnets and bonus magnets is came packaged very well and SUPER FAST!!! THANKS!</li>
            <li> The palette is great!  I immediately took some of my MAC and Make Up For Ever eyeshadow and arranged them in the palette.  It worked great and held on to the palette perfectly.  It really is a great thing to have if you want to have a variety of colors on hand, rather than looking through all you individual eyeshadow.  Also, I think it&#x27;s a great price!  Macs palette is 16 dollars and hold 15, and MUFE sells their palette for $20 and only holds 10, and here you can just throw what you&#x27;ve got, whatever size, and it&#x27;ll hold a lot more.  My first impression was that it was heavy, I expected it to be somewhat light and flimsy, but that was not the case.  It is a great purchase!</li>
            <li> This palette is exactly what I was looking for because I needed to have an easier way to access my favorite makeup. The surface of the palette is some sort of shiny, coated material. I can imagine this getting dirty and damaged because I have already had some trouble removing makeup from it. The interior of the palette is magnetic, and there is a transparent cover in the top. I kind of wish it had a mirror instead of a transparent cover, but that would have just been for convenience. Additionally, the palette comes with some magnetic attachments, so you can make your non magnetic products stick to the palette. These worked well, but I wish there were two sizes for the round magnets. I had some baked eye shadows that were significantly smaller than the circular magnets, so I ended up wasting some space in the palette by using the larger magnet sizes. Overall, I am content with this product, and I think that it was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Found THE BEST dupe to this product!&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amankkhaira.com/2015/03/z-palette-dupe-mac.html</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it claims, good quality. Great for travel. Ended up ordering another one that was larger as well</li>
            <li> Has made depotting my shadows a cinch!</li>
            <li> A+++ amazing pallet! Works perfectly! Will definitely purchase more!!! Holds all pan shadows and blushes! Better than expected! Great Buy!</li>
            <li> I love my z palette, the only thing was most of my shadows didnt have the proper metal to stick to the magnet so I had to use the included stickers but i didnt have enough so I had my dad cut me some metal circles to glue to the bottom. I know you can purchase more, but that seems like a rip off to me, they should include enough to fully use the palette</li>
            <li> I got this pretty quickly even though I ordered it on a holiday weekend. I love that it came with little magnets in case your shadows aren&#x27;t magnetic. The only thing I dislike (this is nothing the manufacturer can change) is how hard it is to depot some shadows! I didn&#x27;t use any of the methods that came on the instruction card because they seemed a little too complicated (oven, flattening iron). Instead, I popped my shadows out of their primary case if I could and put them under my blow dryer on high for a minute and pried them out with a metal makeup spatula. This softened the glue pretty well and most popped out pretty easily. I highly suggest having pure acetone to remove the glue residue off the back. My matte Urban Decay shadows did NOT like this at all and most cracked which I fixed with rubbing alcohol. While I wish it weren&#x27;t so much work to depot the shadows, I will definitely purchase this product again to condense my makeup collection.</li>
            <li> Were smaller than I expected so I was glad that I bought the extra large as well.</li>
            <li> While, I did consolidate products and clear up space in my make-up collection, I broke some products trying to pry them out of original containers. It get messy in there....and if you think it&#x27;s a bummer dropping one of your compacts, try dropping a z-palette full!  It was tragic.  Now I REEEEEALY consolidated my collection...as in a lost a lot of it.</li>
            <li> The Z palette is great! It is better than buying a MAC or Make Up For Ever palette. You can fit both products in the palette and it minimizes the amount that you need to carry. I have two! &#x3D;) I will be buying more when needed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this palette is that it isn&#x27;t made out of the BEST material. The best way I can describe the materials are -- a full slate magnate, cardboard, plastic, and some kind of paper(ish) material. -- I have had mine for about 8 months and it is still going strong so PLEASE don&#x27;t let this deter you from buying this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works like a CHARM!</li>
            <li> Rugged and fantastic quality. Includes some adhesive magnetic pieces. Total life saver! MAC shadows are not automatically magnetic</li>
            <li> It does what it says it does, so I&#x27;m happy! It&#x27;s magnetic and can hold  many colors and in different sizes. This pallet is big.</li>
            <li> Another gift for my granddaughter.  This was on her Christmas list and I wasn&#x27;t sure it was just what she wanted but it was.</li>
            <li> falling in love &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I bought these cases while I was in the process of creating my own palette. They turned out great!! I love them! They protect all my shadows and magnetic blushes. They are also great for traveling.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, spacious, exactly as described. I used it for a few blushes and some eyeshadows and it works great. It&#x27;s nice to have the metal stickers to use if your product isn&#x27;t magnetic. I would buy more if they were cheaper. Since buying this I have purchased two MAC pro palettes which are only $8.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about getting one these from a few reviews I read, but I think its perfect for what I wanted. I have mostly MAC eye shadows, but also some MUG pans. I was shocked how well the MUG pans attached to the bottom of the palette. Totally secure. The MAC ones clung but it was much weaker and I was definitely afraid they would come loose if I travelled with the palette. So I just attached the included magnets to the bottom of the MAC shadows and now they are just as secure. I can turn the palette upside down and wiggle with the lid open and nothing even moves so I am completely confident my expensive shadows are safe</li>
            <li> This is the best and most convenient palette I have purchased, it holds so many pans of makeup perfectly and if the product is not magnetic, it comes with magnetic stickers to attach. AMAZING, I love it and use it every day.</li>
            <li> save money!! prefect for traveling !! Now my gf has some of all her make up in this palette, and no need to have a bag full of lil make up containers !</li>
            <li> amazing! i wish it was not pricey as it is, but i love it  anyway</li>
            <li> its great to depot my shados and put them here so i can have them all together, even my blush and contour powder</li>
            <li> I finally have my organized makeup, this is just what I needed, I regret not having bought it before, i am happy now</li>
            <li> It is a great way to store makeup in one place.  It is smaller than I thought it would be but as it turned out I have enough space.</li>
            <li> Great product however only fit 27 morphe brushes eyeshadows whereas on the morphe brushes website it claimed to fit 28. Quick delivery and great product from Amazon :)</li>
            <li> Love my purchase and fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> Great quality, and a great way to Declutter your makeup drawer.</li>
            <li> Love it. Nice and sleek and saves a lot more room! It was my first time trying this out for myself. It was easy and it came with directions.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with these z palettes! Super convenient to be able to personalize everything you need/want into one place! This is my second large z palette and I plan on getting a few more plus a small one more for day to day carry around.</li>
            <li> i bought this because i needed some of the color for my make up collection.  They were well priced for the quality and rounded out my kit perfectly</li>
            <li> maybe i&#x27;m retarded but it&#x27;s so hard to get the makeup out of the original packaging.  I ruined so many trying to use this palette.  I give up.</li>
            <li> I follow tons of beauty bloggers and vloggers. The Z Palette is changing how we store make up for the better. I never realized how having everything in one place is just so handy whether I&#x27;m at home or traveling. It flat enough I can even slide it into my purse for those days when I need to go day to night. It is 100% worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little depotting hint. If you break up your powders add a little rubbing alcohol in and let it dry. It looks brand new in the morning. Oh and be careful using a flat iron to loosen it up off the box because the plastic can melt. Oops!</li>
            <li> Great Help For a Family of 6 with extra to spare</li>
            <li> I bought my Z Palette directly from the manufacturer after collecting so many random eyeshadow samples and individual pots that I wanted to depot that I figured I needed a good place to combine them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Z Palette has received such good reviews, both from gurus and reviewers, so I have to imagine that my experience is probably just a one-off, but I thought I would share it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a month, the plastic/cardboard sides that hold the makeup in place separated from the base. Within two months the magnet base bowed so now everything inside is on a slight slope. Within another month, the plastic cover began to separate from the tape that holds it in place. This thing is literally falling apart on me and the real kicker? I rarely ever use it. I have never travelled with it, it mostly sits on my makeup desk and gets used maybe once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I just got a lemon, but for half the price I can get one of the new palettes from MAC and they are infinitely better quality (actual plastic rather than plastic-coated cardboard!). Highly unrecommended.</li>
            <li> Great palette.  Love the size.  Perfect for my needs.  Much sturdier than I expected....I&#x27;m a ready-made palette person.</li>
            <li> I discovered these things on YouTube makeup tutorials. I had purchased a special palette from urban decay but it came in a cardboard box and was very bulky and cumbersome. So I took the shadows out and put them in the z pallete along with some other shadows. It has consolidated my makeup drawer and I love it!!! It also gives you magnetic stickers in case your shadows don&#x27;t come in a metallic pot. (Which my e.lf. Shadows did not) it comes with instructions on how to remove the pans such as baking in oven to melt glue. Very worth the purchase! I recommend!</li>
            <li> The large size held all my makeup! If you have some cosmetics that are rounded on top, they may not fit!!! Just FYI ! But it is a fabulous tool for most make-up! Which is flat!</li>
            <li> Loved the z palette that I bought 2.  I primarily use the z palettes to hold my eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> So awesome to de-clutter makeup. I de-potted all my eyeshadows and put all of my favorites in this!! Great buy</li>
            <li> Love this and am now obsessed with depotting my stuff and putting it in one big palette.&lt;br /&gt;I had a ton of MAC eyeshadows that were taking up an obscene amount of room in my makeup drawer and so I decided to depot them and put them in this.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great, it works, and is ideal for travel.</li>
            <li> I loved these Z palettes these were perfect for my makeup case! I&#x27;m a makeup artists and these were very helpful! I look more organized</li>
            <li> very recommendable if you want to organize your makeup more efficiently.  notice that it&#x27;s not the most durable product, you&#x27;ll need to be gentle with it.</li>
            <li> This is so great for creating your own makeup pallet. When you purchase a pallet that is already full of shadows and blushes there is usually around 1\4 of the colors that you will never use. With this you create exactly what you want.  And everything is always at your fingertips. Love it!!</li>
            <li> Very practical and it comes with extra magnets for makeup in non magnetic pots..only issue is that makeup (shadow or blush) that is domed us too high for the lid to shut!</li>
            <li> mine was a blue black and super great quality. fits my new shadows prefectl.y</li>
            <li> So convenient, would&#x27;ve gotten more stars if the magnets were stronger. They fall out occasionally.</li>
            <li> If you can de pot you&#x27;ll be in love!</li>
            <li> Works better than I expected it to. Most of my make up was already magnetic so I didn&#x27;t have to attach the magnets to it. However the magnets provided do not stick well, they kept falling off the back of my eyeshadow, on the few I had to use it on.</li>
            <li> I had a lot of single eyeshadows that I kept in a makeup bag but it was annoying in the morning to always sift thru the containers to find the ones I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Having this palette made it easy for me to depot my single ones and put them all in one place. It&#x27;s great because I was able to add different size eyeshadows and even blushes. It&#x27;s also easier to travel with; having one slim magnetic case vs having 20 single little containers.&lt;br /&gt;It allowed me to clean up my bathroom/makeup area and now I use more of the makeup i already had, because I can finally see it all!&lt;br /&gt;I need to get another one to finish depotting my single makeup products.</li>
            <li> Not broken, totally great for make up geek make up!</li>
            <li> came in broken, and didn&#x27;t come with the magnetic stickers like the post claims. returning it and am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This palette is great for keeping make up organized.  It makes it so easy to take on trips and select only the ones you need.  It is made of recyclable materials, but it sure feels sturdy.  I have had mine for a few months now, and even after daily use, it keeps up great!  I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Dunno how I ever lived without this!  Helps keep my collection organized.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for all my depotted shadows, love the clear top, great magnetic closure. Will be great for traveling easily</li>
            <li> Great way to free up space!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a great size, especially for traveling. I bought 2 and both have held up really well - one has been on multiple 1000+ mile road trips and looks just as good as the one that stays at home. Definitely has helped clear up clutter on my vanity and would recommend this size if you travel a lot but can&#x27;t seem to dial down and only bring a few things. Would make a great gift.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Z Palettes speak for themselves.  The price is about the same as anywhere for these, but Prime helps.</li>
            <li> This is my first Z palette and I must say that I am loving it. Love that I was able to consolidate all of my single shadows into one spot. Also love the clear top.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to put all of my eye shadows in one place.  It&#x27;s magnetic but comes with self-stick metal tabs to put on pans that aren&#x27;t metal.  It&#x27;s a great way to keep up with samples that don&#x27;t come in a compact.  Love this!</li>
            <li> I love this Z palette! I think it is amazing! I also comes with magnets to put on your non-magnitized make up pans. I am going to buy more when I can! I am also thinking about getting the \\&quot;extra deep\\&quot; one for my minerlized blush! I am going to order more!</li>
            <li> I used it for Sleek eyeshadows, it takes up to 40 eyeshadows. I don&#x27;t use it for Mac eyeshadows but it will hold less than 40 shadows because the pans are bigger in size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It made picking and matching the colors so easy it even helped me get inspired and use more colors that I used to do in one look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you fill the whole palette you won&#x27;t need to attach the magnet to the pan because it will hold up by it self, but if the palette is not packed with eyeshadow pans it will keep moving unless you attach the magnets to the pan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish if they had a smaller palette that would hold 2-4 pans only.</li>
            <li> I have tried several of the empty magnetic palettes and this one is my favorite by far. The space that it saves with my mac makeup is incredible. I would highly recommend this to all of my MUA friends and everyone that wears makeup.</li>
            <li> I love my Z palette and the best part of it was that I got it in the mail  quicker than I thought It would.</li>
            <li> I love these palettes! I have the leopard print and now black. Holds so many more eyeshadow pots than my old MAC palettes, that finally wore out and broke. It&#x27;s great that you can put different size products in it as well.</li>
            <li> Love Z Palettes! I use it to store my de-poted make up pans and all my Make Up Geek / MAC shadows. I also have a large cheetah, two small black ones, and a pro size on order. If you love make up and don&#x27;t like having a bunch of singles around, this is perfect. It is an actual Z Palette brand and came in perfect condition. No complaints.</li>
            <li> Literally minimized my bundles and bundles of makeup into this one comforable palette. I dont know about you but when i buy palettes i usually use one or two in the whole collection. Removing the one and two from the billions of palettes i have make it some much easier to find the colors i love. This is a life saver! Every girl who LOVES makeup should have like 3 of these!</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised.  Perfect.</li>
            <li> So glad I bought this. De-potting is fun &amp; so handy!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase.    I decided to buy one because I&#x27;ve used MAC palettes for years since I first started getting into makeup. I wanted a palette that offered more freedom so I could depot all of my drugstore and other brand eyeshadows and depot a MAC blush. I was able to depot it all and it all fit! I love the design of it with the clear plastic so you can see your products and the strong magnet. It also gives me the freedom I craved I adore this purchase and the delivery from Beauty.com was drama-free.    Very very happy!</li>
            <li> I love my Z Palettes. I didn&#x27;t expect to receive my item for another week but I actually received it in 3 days! Z Palettes are the way to go and they really have helped me utilize all of the makeup that I have and not foret about them stored in some drawer!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my Z Palette. It was large enough to fit all of my single eye shadows in and I still have room for more and extra magnets. I have had it for over a year and I use it every single day. It has held up well and looks just like the day I bought it!</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these. I love them! I was worried that the clear window would be too flimsy, but it&#x27;s much sturdier than I thought and hasn&#x27;t been a problem. They also come with magnets, so you don&#x27;t have to buy anything extra if you need to stick your Mac or Nyx depotted shadows in there. Seriously, if you want to condense your shadows and powders, buy this right now. It&#x27;s a space saving and travel must have.</li>
            <li> This product is so great! It makes it easy to change out eyeshadows</li>
            <li> Exactly what it is... Good quality I just keep wanting more</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I haven&#x27;t purchased something like this a long time ago! I&#x27;ve been doing make up professionally for 10 years and this palette is genius.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my MakeupGeek shadows &amp; it&#x27;s divine. Very sturdy. It even came with little magnets to attach to non-magnetic pans!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many times to consolidate palettes, finally some one made one!  Still loosening pots of shadows is a challenge.</li>
            <li> Love it. All my individual eye shadows fit into this case. No more searching for colors. Unit slides right into my make up bag which hangs on the back of the bathroom door. Very slim... good find</li>
            <li> Great palette for my makeup geek</li>
            <li> I am having so much fun customizing my pallet! This is wonderful!!! And I love that it comes with magnets for the pots that aren&#x27;t magnetized.</li>
            <li> I was smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> Love it! Works great and plenty of room.</li>
            <li> I loves the pallets. The hard part is de-potting your eyeshadows and blushes.</li>
            <li> Love that you can see what colors you have through the clear top, and that it comes with adhesive discs so that you can depot your product and use a disc to magnetize it to the pallett.</li>
            <li> I bought this palette to hold some eyeshadows that were taking up too much room and this palette holds all 15 of them with room for more. It also allowed me to color code them so they are perfectly organized and save a lot of space. i have not traveled with it yet but it has held up really well. I love all the color and pattern choices it comes in- I have the pink one but am looking into getting a small peacock or leopard print one for lipstick.</li>
            <li> The Z palette is amazing. If you want to organize your shadows, blushes or bronzers. I recommend this. I have depotted almost all my shadows into z palettes. Just have to get more palettes to finish them all. So much awesome organization. Best part is that there is a clear cover. So you can see what is inside the palette. Great if you have several palettes.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also 100% recyclable. That makes it even better. Completely environmentally friendly. Also very affordable and comes in different colours and sizes. You will find one that will work best for you easily.&lt;br /&gt;You will not regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> Although I love this Z palettes and this is my second purchase I have had the same problem with this twice already. The magnets that are provided for the eye shadows and blushes that are not already magnetized simply do not stick to the pan. The adhesive is very weak and slides right off. For those eye shadows that are magnetized it is a great product.</li>
            <li> I discovered this concept when I received a GlamRX palette from an Ipsy bag. I loved the concept, but the GlamRX is too small to hold much of anything. I purchased the Z palette and after an evening with a candle, screwdriver and all of my potted makeup, I soon had a full Z palette of unpotted makeup. I found cheaper alternatives to the Z palette, such as magnetic craft boxes, but the design of the Z palette is perfect for makeup application. Not only can you instantly see what is inside, the lid flips underneath completely, so it is easy to hold while applying makeup. Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product and concept, even though I am sure it is not original to Z palette. A must have for any girl!</li>
            <li> A little cheaper to buy it on amazon. Still magnetized and comes with little magnets. So excited to make my own custom palette with it!!</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves the Z palette! She&#x27;s able to keep all of her shadows in here and with lots of room to add more shadows. Extremely useful product!</li>
            <li> This is the first z palette I&#x27;ve ever gotten, and it&#x27;s so much fun!  I feel like a legit makeup artist using this!  I have cleared a lot of clutter by consolidating all my eye shadows into the palette, and it&#x27;s awesome to see everything I have in once place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only hard part (unrelated to the product) is getting my eye shadows de-potted!  This palette came with a small baggie full of circle and square magnet stickers, so the eye shadows I had that didn&#x27;t have any glue left on them or weren&#x27;t already magnetic are super easy to convert so they&#x27;ll stick in this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a must-have for anyone looking to make their collection a little more professional and streamlined.  The black is sleek and the magnetic closure is great.  I will purchase another for my blush/bronzer once I figure out how to de-pot those, lol.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, and larger than I had expected, which is nice. It seems to be better quality than my Leopard print Z Palette which is strange but so far I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> This palette is so convenient. I deported my naked 2 eyeshadow a, Clinique blush and eyeshadow, and some miscellaneous eyeshadows. It love how much it cut down on excess packaging, the included magnets are pretty weak and I put extras on the items that needed them. I also had to super glue a couple magnets to the product. Also, it is a little hard to keep clean. I know that&#x27;s a little nit picky, but I love keeping my makeup products wiped down, and the base of the pallette likes to hold on to the extra powder/product that comes off the brushes.</li>
            <li> Great quality and sturdy</li>
            <li> lalallooovveee it!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This was my 1st z-palette. I love it! It&#x27;s simple. I don&#x27;t care for design or it being colorful or girlie. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is a must-have for anyone who needs to de-clutter their makeup. Most powder makeup products can be de-potted easily (check youtube for tutorials). Some pans are naturally compatible with the Z Palette&#x27;s magnets and some aren&#x27;t, so I love that little magnets are provided.  It&#x27;s sturdy but maybe a little pricey depending on where you purchase. Amazon had the large for the same price as the small size retails for normally, I&#x27;m not sure if it was a glitch or a flash sale type of thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend you purchase a stainless steel cosmetic spatula to help with the de-potting process so that you don&#x27;t ruin your makeup (although you can fix it with rubbing alcohol if you do).</li>
            <li> my daughter likes to try different cosmetics so I thought this small sample size would be a good way to try these products</li>
            <li> Great item! Fast shipping. Product came as described.</li>
            <li> Love it. I have more space in my stash now. It came with magnetized base and very light weight. The slim design will also useful for traveling. Most likely will get my 2nd palette soon.</li>
            <li> Very convenient! Great size</li>
            <li> I bought my first Z Palette and depotted all of my MAC eyeshadows into it. It&#x27;s cheaper than buying an empty MAC palette and much more convenient. You can easily arrange how you want the colors and fit over 20 MAC shadows in one large Z Palette. You can also depot other eyeshadows (for example, I put my Mary Kay shadows in there as well). It&#x27;s my absolute favorite thing that I own! Definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love it!! Filled it up right away!</li>
            <li> Great palette. Love having all my depotted shadows in one place. I will note that the magnets this comes with lose their tackiness and start to fall off the pots. I don&#x27;t know if that is a common thing with those but it&#x27;s easily fixed with new ones from a hardware or craft store.</li>
            <li> This product worked like a charm as long as I kept it at home. I bought it because I was going on vacation and didn&#x27;t want to drag 15 different eyeshadow pans with me. Unfortunately, my products did not survive baggage handling at the airport. Hundreds of dollars worth of eyeshadows were ruined! My Lancome colors (which already have a magnetized base) survived the trip, but all my other shadows, including the MAC shadows (without the magnetized base, only the provided magnets) did not stay put (you have to use your own glue). As a result, one of the eyeshadows (the darkest one no less) broke, ruining the case and all the colors within. I&#x27;m still cleaning up from the mess, trying to salvage what I can.</li>
            <li> Love it! Only problem is the metal stickers don&#x27;t stay stuck to the make up well. Had a couple eyeshadows shift around.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE my Z Palette! Fits all my different shapes of eyeshadows. The hardest thing is, is fitting the shadows in the pallet to make them look pretty. It&#x27;s like a puzzle but they will fit and once placed wont move around cause the bottom of the palett is magnetized. The lid is also stays shut with a magnet closure. The design of the whole pallet is slim and doesn&#x27;t take up allot of room. i love clear lid which makes it easy for me to see what shadows are in what pallet. I love this pallet better than the MAC pro pallet (which i also have).</li>
            <li> This palette seems more lightweight than the others I ordered before. The only con is that there seems to be a warp on the lid so that it doesn&#x27;t close exactly as it should unless you give it a little push.</li>
            <li> My eye shadows were all over the place.  Now, it&#x27;s all compact.  It has made my eye make up area more organized</li>
            <li> These pallets are great for storing depoted make up. They hold a lot of product and the magnetic lid ensures that it stays closed when on the go traveling.</li>
            <li> I was scared to order this considering I have never had one. But I am so glad I did because I love it! I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good. It&#x27;s not perfect because for me a perfect would be handmade by a loved one. But it comes pretty close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to be sturdy, but take good care of it like anything else and it will last. I have things from my childhood that are comparable in quality to this that are still around and work just fine, in good condition, so just treat it with respect and it will last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The magnetic patch is nice and strong, stronger than those craft magnetic patches you can buy are so don&#x27;t bother tryung to dupe unless you have some strong magnets and are building it right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This palette comes with the little magnetic stickers in different shapes and sizes for your aluminum pans, pried out from other sources, but I also use it with myomakeup.com 25ct magnetic pans (available on Amazon for cheap!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The magnetic pans you can find work perfectly awesome with this. Included with the palette is a small how-to card for pressing powders, but you can find YouTube videos too for that if you need it. If you&#x27;re new, just stick the magnetic stickers to your pans and set them in the Z-Palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
            <li> I had a bunch of NYX single eyeshadwos taking up a lot of space in my drawer. They are pretty thick so I was worried they wouldn&#x27;t fit in the palette, but they do! Makes it so much easier having all my eyeshadows in one place. Also helpful that the palette already comes with magenets.</li>
            <li> I bought this after purchasing some individual eyeshadow pots from MAC cosmetics and Makeup Geek. It is really convenient to have all of my favorites in one palette. The closure on these is very nice although if traveling I would recommend putting it under clothes in a suitcase to keep it closed. It also comes with magnets that you can affix to the bottom of your pots that come in different sizes and shapes. Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> The pallet was smaller than i expected. Does not look large at all but works well and does the job.</li>
            <li> This is my first empty palette of any sort, but so far I&#x27;m very happy.  I&#x27;ve had it for about a month.  I would still give this 5 stars just for the space it&#x27;s saved me in my drawer, and because I&#x27;m a sucker for organization.  I have no other palettes to compare this to, though.  If I try something else out and hate it, I&#x27;d definitely bump this up to 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a Urban Decay Book of Shadows 4, sitting in my drawer for a couple of years now.  I would always ignore my Book of Shadows and use cheaper quads from the drugstore just because the BoS packaging was so bulky and terrible. I felt like it was just such a waste that I wasn&#x27;t using the shadows because of Urban Decay&#x27;s frivolous packaging, so I decided to invest in this Large Z Palette. I definitely have used my BoS shadows more recently because of the fact that I can immediately see the shadows through the lid and don&#x27;t have to fuss with UD&#x27;s packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&gt;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&gt;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it comes with magnets so that you can stick them onto the backs of pans that aren&#x27;t attracted to the magnet in the Z-palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plenty of room for a lot of eyeshadows!  I have about 20 eyeshadows in there, 16 from the BoS, and a couple of single pots I had around, along with a powder).  Still have a ton of room.  It&#x27;s especially great because the BoS pans are all squares so I can really nudge them in the corners and right next to each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See through lid is great so I don&#x27;t have to open it to see what colors I&#x27;d like to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The black Z-Palette looks very sleek.  Very slim profile, but not too cheap feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Magnet in the back feels strong enough to keep my things in place (however, I wouldn&#x27;t be throwing this thing around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&gt;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&gt;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve definitely stabbed a couple of powders trying to depot (user error, obviously, so I didn&#x27;t dock stars for that).  If you&#x27;re very careful, I&#x27;m sure you can keep everything in great shape, but it&#x27;s a fair warning to be patient when depotting shadows and things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d personally prefer something with a snap closure, but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s possible (I&#x27;m unaware of what else is around).  Also, for this price, I really don&#x27;t feel like I can complain too much.  I don&#x27;t feel like I can keep shadows in here forever, but I doubt I&#x27;d do that anyway.everything in great shape, but it&#x27;s a fair warning to be patient when depotting shadows and things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d personally prefer something with a snap closure, but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s possible (I&#x27;m unaware of what else is around).  Also, for this price, I really don&#x27;t feel like I can complain too much.  I don&#x27;t feel like I can keep shadows in here forever, but I doubt I&#x27;d do that anyway.</li>
            <li> Overall I love it, I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because the sticky part of the magnets do not work at all. I had to glue the magnet to the shadow, other than that I love it! I&#x27;ll be ordering more!</li>
            <li> Came with the magnets and everything, great condition, and I know it will be amazingly useful. I want to get another.</li>
            <li> After around a year of use a thin layer of plastic started peeling off the black cardboard material. I never traveled with, or kept the palettes in a high humidity area such as a bathroom. When I contacted the manufacturer they seemed aware that this was an issue and the best they could do was to offer me a 20% discount and encouraged me to repurchase more palettes. Needless to say I wish I never depotted all my eyeshadows to have them in a palette that didn&#x27;t end up lasting.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. It really helped me declutter - all my older makeup is now in one place.&lt;br /&gt;I was wary of putting my eye shadows in the oven to get them out of their packaging, but it really worked and nothing got burned.</li>
            <li> I love the Z Palette, and I have a few in different colors. It has allowed me to organize my makeup and do away with a million small compacts. The clear window lets you see what&#x27;s inside, and the lid flips under so you don&#x27;t have to fight to keep it open on your vanity or whatever you use. I love it for traveling, which I do a lot. And it fits anything, not just eye shadows. It&#x27;s so easy to change them around. When I&#x27;m at home I usually have eye shadows in one, blushes in another, etc. But if I only want to bring one palette with me - I can put shadows and blushes in one. I used to use Mac Palettes since I use their shadows a lot, but they don&#x27;t offer all of these features and didn&#x27;t fit as many. Plus you couldn&#x27;t mix and match blushes and shadows. The Z Palettes are much sturdier too.</li>
            <li> Love thiS it&#x27;s definitely worth getting this one over the small one !</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the idea of this palette!! Some genius found a way to put all of your shadows into one palette to increase your makeup space. To whoever that was I say thank you!! I love this palette. Not only do I have more space but i&#x27;m able to see the colors that I don&#x27;t use often. This is a must have for those with a lot of different eye shadows.</li>
            <li> Before I bought this, I decided to do a &amp;#34;DIY Z Palette&amp;#34; and I was so excited to make one but it didn&#x27;t turn out as sturdy as I wanted it too so I just ended up buying this. Really happy that I purchased this. I use these for my MAC &amp; makeupgeek eyeshadows/ MAC blushes. I wish it was just a little more sleek though but whatevs.</li>
            <li> These empty palettes are the best. I had a lot of old small shadow packages with some of the shadows already used, but with some still there. This palette is a great resource for de-potting some of those cumbersome eyeshadows and putting them all in one place.&lt;br /&gt;This specific palette is not the domed one--you most likely won&#x27;t be able to place your baked shadows (or as I tried, bronzers and blush) into this particular one. For that purpose, I purchased the Sephora Z-palette in store.&lt;br /&gt;Also -1 star for magnet adhesive (there are many magnets included in the packaging--both small square and round): it&#x27;s not great. I&#x27;ve been having some problems with a few of my de-potted shadows with adhesive not sticking very well, all this despite extensively cleaning the back prior to careful application. I ended up buying some magnet tape at Michael&#x27;s, which has a much tackier/stickier backing and works great (I think it was about $2). Overall, great idea and very sturdy design.</li>
            <li> Perfect for de-potting some Urban Decay Shadows.  Will be ordering another one soon!</li>
            <li> Just what I expected it to be. I did think it was going to be a bit bigger to be honest but that was my fault for not reading the size dimensions. I will be ordering more of these! Maybe next time in a color.</li>
            <li> I got this palette as I was looking to put my eye shadows in and also blushes and anything else. The magnets work amazing with makeup geek eye shadows and the metal rounds work pretty good with the MAC shadows I have. It holds more than I have right now and I would be willing to buy this again to use for more shadows as I get them. I like the window on the top so I can see what shadows I do have in the case.</li>
            <li> Love the Z Palettes! So easy to use. Smaller ones great for travel too. Take just the shadows you need.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two of these palettes for a little over a year. I keep eyeshadows in one and blushes, highlighter, and bronzer in the other. They have held up reasonably well and kept my makeup protected. The only exception to this was when I dropped one and a nars highlighter broke and crumbled. This would have happened if it was still in the packaging so I don&#x27;t count this as a flaw of any kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I have noticed, which is the reason I give the Z Palette a four star rating, is that my Hoola bronzer is slightly too tall for the palette and has caused the plexi to crack around the edges of the pan. This is a very popular bronzer and I&#x27;m surprised this wasn&#x27;t taken into account during the design process.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it too long but I really really like it. I have a lot of makeup and it&#x27;s helped make it easier to travel with a makeup variety. Worst part is depotting.</li>
            <li> Extremely happy with my purchase! Very sturdy and worth the money. I buy a lot of individual pans of eye shadows and blushes and this palette keeps everything looking very neat and organized. Heard about the palette through Jaclyn Hill on YouTube and I will definitely continue to buy more Z Palettes!</li>
            <li> This product is good if you need to organize your make-up.  If you have a lot of individual colors, you may find this product to be too small.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of indivdual pieces at this time, but when I increase my product, this palette will be too small.  Overall, great product.</li>
            <li> Love this palette it just helps me keep my makeup more organized and I reach more for colors now I previously only had buried away. Very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> My zpalette came fast and loved it so much i orderer another 2! Lol it helps organize your makeup very well. I&#x27;m using it for shadows at the moment and i find that Im using things i normally didnt reach for. Must have!</li>
            <li> I wish the larger palettes came in more colors, but the Z palette is just the best thing ever. I depot all my urban decay, too faced and wet n wild shadows into these. We all know how bulky and inconvenient most eyeshadow palettes are, and this fixes all of that. My one last complaint is that Z palettes come with round magnetic strips for your shadows and most of the shadows I depot are square or rectangular. It&#x27;d be nice if it just came with a cuttable magnetic strip like I think the Unii palettes do. But I much prefer these to the Uniis because you can actually see what&#x27;s inside.</li>
            <li> I have the official MK Compact Pro but wanted something that made better use of the space. This fits all the eyeshadow a I had tucked into the brush areas that aren&#x27;t magnetic in the Compact Pro, as well as everything in the mini compact and all the extra products I still had in the plastic cases. All MK products are magnetic and they fit exactly. I could probably have 30 of the eye shadows and 9 blushes at least. More room!&lt;br /&gt;The magnetic back is really strong. I wish this was hard plastic, so until I&#x27;ve had it a year to see if it disintegrates, only 4 stars.</li>
            <li> This is great I was able to fit all shape eyeshadow in this container. I am buying another one.</li>
            <li> Received as expected.</li>
            <li> Much smaller than expected, disappointed. This should be called a small.</li>
            <li> Product is as listed.</li>
            <li> I currently have 5 large Z Palettes and 2 small ones. I love them. They&#x27;ve really helped me condense my makeup collection. Even though they are made of cardboard with a plastic window, they are really sturdy. The magnet on the bottom and the magnetic closure are nice and strong. I love that the palettes also come with adhesive metal disks to help with non-magnetic pans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Z Palette website has a lot of great information about how many pans each palette size holds, so if you are unsure what size to get, it&#x27;s a great resource.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few things that I would love to see in the future: a larger palette size (the pro size isn&#x27;t much bigger than the large), smaller adhesive metal disks for small shadows (I don&#x27;t like the disk being larger than the shadow pan), and a price reduction (just because I love a good bargain).</li>
            <li> Love them for my pressed shadows. NYX shadows, once depotted, are not magnetic but the included magnetic stickers fix that in a second. Saves space since I pressed my Concrete Minerals and Shiro Cosmetics shadows, and my depotted NYX shadows.</li>
            <li> I depot all my products so that I can put them all in one handy place - this Z palette! (go to you tube for how to depot tutorials - they are not always the same).  It makes life simpler!</li>
            <li> Great quality product to corral my un-panned make-up items!</li>
            <li> Z Palette&#x27;s are great! I recently purchased my first and was able to organize a large amount of my eyeshadows into one palette. It has saved me so much room in my makeup collection and I love the different prints you can pick out also!</li>
            <li> I took all my bulky and broken blush and eye shadow containers and depotted the metal trays by setting them on my warm straightener on a piece of wax paper to protect them. the glue gets loose and a thin knife can slide in and pop the metal trays of product out quickly. then just place them in the pallet if they are magnetic if not the pallet comes with stickers and you can place them on the back and organize them any way. Saves tons of space and time! I can&#x27;t wait to get my small one for travel to take only essentials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;looks great, comes in many colors, thin, light weight, durable (so far), saved me lots of space.</li>
            <li> I bought this for all of my MAC and Makeup Geek shadows - I love the clear top so I can see what palette I am grabbing. The palette comes with the magnet stickers so it makes it super easy when de-potting my shadows!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a z palette for a while, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot on it. I ordered this one, and I love it! I received it very fast.</li>
            <li> I really like having all my makeup in ONE container with a window. I&#x27;ve heard so much about these palettes and when my makeup collection exceeded their space, I needed to find a way to store them efficiently. This is PERFECT! I looked up how to de-pot makeup on youtube. Easy peasy with a flat iron. I also removed the product label and stuck it to the bottom of of the pot. This way, you will always have reference of the makeup. This palette comes with nickel size round magnets (perfectly fits MAC eyeshadows) and smaller square magnets. You can purchase extra magnets on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I saved all my MAC containers and will be turning them in for free products. I have so much more room in my makeup area now. I purchased a few more Z-palettes to use with ALL my makeup! I even bought a small one for travel. Wish I had joined the trend with these Z-palettes sooner!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting my makeup collection &amp; I&#x27;ve been wanting to buy a z pallet for the longest &amp; when I finally received it &amp; transferred my favorite eyeshadows, I feel more organized &amp; happy. They r easy to find &amp; they look so pretty together.</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> Plastic cover was cracked on the edges when it arrived. Doesn&#x27;t feel durable so I&#x27;m predicting a short lifespan.</li>
            <li> Loved the product and delivery was perfect.Can&#x27;t wait to buy another</li>
            <li> Perfect size and it holds 27 makeup pans</li>
            <li> This is adorable! It&#x27;s cute and practical. It is absolutely perfect if you want to find a way to organize you make up and have it look good as well.</li>
            <li> great pallete! it comes in a wide variety of colors and sizes and i love it. this is a great thing way to store blushes, powders, and any other types of makeup that comes in pans.</li>
            <li> Z Palettes are an absolute must have for anyone who loves, wears, or owns any makeup! They are so convenient for so many reason! They are easy to store and great to travel with! They are sturdy enough to through in a makeup bag/purse for daily use, or in a suitcase to travel with. My favorite uses for them are making custom palettes, and to condense bulkier palettes into something more easily to store. I can honestly say my collection wouldn&#x27;t be complete without them!</li>
            <li> I picked up my first Z-Palette at IMATS NY 2013 and immediately fell in love! It is a simple and easy way to put your makeup in one palette without having to worry about pre-cut shapes! Right now I only have my Inglot shadows in it (it fits 18  squares with ease!) but I plan to buy more so I can start depotting some of my eye shadow singles from brands like Urban Decay! The Z-Palette is slim (as opposed to UD&#x27;s customize palette)so it won&#x27;t take up a lot of space. The only \\&quot;downside\\&quot; to it may be that it&#x27;s made out of cardboard like material so I worry a little about how long it will hold up, but for now it&#x27;s amazing. Also, even though it comes with magnets to use if the pan of the product you want to put in it isn&#x27;t already metal I&#x27;ve found that I haven&#x27;t needed them. The magnetic bottom of the Z-Palette is super strong so my shadows don&#x27;t move around, but I can take them out and rearrange them with ease!</li>
            <li> I thought this was a grreat product but a little overpriced. I feel like i&#x27;m paying a premium because this is the only customizable palette out there. that being said, still very sturdy well built product.</li>
            <li> I expected this product to be a little bit bigger, but overall it does the job. I would order another one except bigger.</li>
            <li> works perfectly for all the loose blushes or shadows a have depotted.</li>
            <li> Saves room, helps organize, and so versatile. Perfect for travel also.</li>
            <li> So much fun to add my pans to the palette and have them all organized and in one place!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> high quality with a nice magnetic surface.  i use it every day!  it doesn&#x27;t even show any wear and i&#x27;ve had it for several months now!</li>
            <li> I really like this...I had a bunch (like 50) loose pans and this really did the trick combining and now I can actually see and use them. I read some reviews that this wasn&#x27;t magnetic enough I didn&#x27;t have that problem. I purchased the large pallet (not for traveling) this does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love the Z palette! I keep all my loose shadows in it and don&#x27;t have to worry about them getting busted, lost, or dirty. The magnetic lid is amazing and it stays shut to matter what happens (unless you open it, of course). The bottom magnet isn&#x27;t super strong so changing out the colors is easy but the colors stay where you put them. Brilliant product!</li>
            <li> perfect, just as expected</li>
            <li> Perfect for the miscellaneous eye shadows I had laying around!!! Saves me time and space in my bathroom.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be ordering another one soon!</li>
            <li> This is a magnetic case to put make up in.</li>
            <li> I decided to depot a few my eyeshadows and honestly it&#x27;s too much work in my opinion.  The Z palette is nice and works as expected.  The large really doesn&#x27;t fit a lot of eyeshadows. I mostly depotted an Urban Decay book of shadows hoping to save space.  I did save space, but not sure the effort is worth it. On the other hand, the Z Palette would be perfect for eyeshadows like Makeup Geek.  For MAC, I still prefer the MAC palettes. I feel they are more secure in the MAC Palette. The Z palette would be advantageous if you wanted to put both eyeshadows and blushes on the same palette, then the Z palette would be much better.</li>
            <li> good premise, subpar materials and construction (made of cardboard). go ahead and spend a little more for the hard plastic case of the UNII. Although this one was &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34; i know it would only handle so much jostling in my bag before it broke down, or worse, would have exploded makeup all over. i suppose you could secure it with a ghetto rubberband. I didn&#x27;t want the hassle-I returned it without problem</li>
            <li> Nice palette but such a hassle having to put glue on the magnets they supposedly come with it but doesnt work!</li>
