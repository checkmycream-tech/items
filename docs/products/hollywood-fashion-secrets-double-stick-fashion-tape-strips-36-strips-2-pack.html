            <li>Theses are great for a variety of applications.  </li>
            <li>I have been planning weddings for years and never thought about using this product until a makeup artist informed me how great it works.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this product!!</li>
            <li>but these are VERY strong adhesive, so they&#x27;re very effective!</li>
            <li>These things working amazing!</li>
            <li>Worked amazing!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>This tape is amazing!  </li>
            <li>These are amazing!</li>
            <li>These work perfectly for making sure your bra stays tucked away.</li>
            <li>Awesome even better then I could have imagined.</li>
            <li>After reading all the great reviews on this product i was sure is was going to be a god sent!</li>
            <li>and I am a novice at using these, I will be fair and give this product 4 stars.</li>
            <li>Also good for keeping your bra strap in place.   </li>
            <li>These are the best way I&#x27;ve found to secure a wrap front blouse or dress.</li>
            <li>might be good for placing straps.</li>
            <li>They work just as good on skin as on cloth.</li>
            <li>You have to give the shoe a bit if a tug when you take it off as there is good sticking power, but you can get three to four wears from one strip.</li>
            <li>I used these as part of the mini gift bags for a group of bridesmaids and they all loved them.</li>
            <li>If you want to try these, this is a good price.  </li>
            <li>This fashion strips does a good jobðŸ˜€</li>
            <li>We used these for my daughters prom as her dress was strapless and it gave her a good sense of security that the dress would stay in place.</li>
            <li>A friend told me about Fashion Tape and every thing she said is true - it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>It was delivered quickly and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Great product, quick service!!</li>
            <li>Am very pleased with this product - it works just as it says.  </li>
            <li>Great product, I love it.</li>
            <li>Now I feel very safe knowing that everything stays where it suppose to</li>
            <li>It does the job beautifully and is easy to remove from your clothing at the end of the day.</li>

            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>Love Hollywood Tape!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I ordered it!</li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>They work great and are easy to remove from the skin and clothes.</li>
            <li>For it to hold up that well under that kind of strain is pretty awesome!</li>
            <li>Omg, this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>I think these strips are amazing.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s when I remembered that I have this amazing fashion tape.</li>
            <li>So many good uses for it,</li>
            <li>It has many uses and works really good.  </li>
            <li>Its also handy when you need to hem a skirt or pants in a bind.</li>
            <li>Was a bridesmaid in a wedding, and it came really in handy for all of the bridesmaids.</li>
            <li>Honestly this tape is a life saver.</li>
            <li>It also never ever caused any kind of damage or irritation to my skin.</li>
            <li>Also, Topstitch comes in nice 1&amp;#34; width strips, which i prefer to the 1/2&amp;#34; Hollywood tape.  </li>
            <li>The Hollywood Fashion Tape, This stuff really works great!  </li>
            <li>These are super sticky and work great, glad she recommended them to me!</li>
            <li>I bought it to help hold up some thigh high socks (not stockings) and it worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s would be great for evening gowns and/or cocktail dresses for a special night out too.</li>
            <li>I love it and have recommended it to many of my friends and even give them a strip to try before they buy to prove how good it is.  </li>
            <li>but it was very easy to peel off when the evening was over...</li>
            <li>I can place it under a garment, right on top of my shoulder or between 2 garments ( like a tank top and cardigan), with the sticky surface on top of or underneath the pad...whichever works best.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, holds great, doesn&#x27;t damage clothes, and easy to take off.</li>
            <li>So far it works great!</li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s by far the best solution I&#x27;ve found for the problem.</li>
            <li>So handy with many uses - hems, cleavage cover, shirt gaps, bra strap alignment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great to hold my over-the-knee boots in place (for more than 7 hours, but in cool weather).  </li>
            <li>The small take-along tins are the best and I am so happy I got so many!</li>
            <li>Tapes keep clothing in place and remove easily when done!</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend!</li>
            <li>The shipping was also very fast which I was happy about.</li>
            <li>Fashion tape works well for a quick hem, but I&#x27;ve never been able to use it successfully for anything else.  </li>
            <li>It works awesome no matter how you decide to use it, on your bare skin or just to stick two pieces of material.</li>
            <li>Does not perform well on very smooth fabrics.</li>
            <li>I feel very comfortable that I am not going to twist my ankle or my heel</li>
            <li>Luckily I was good</li>
            <li>Love the nifty tin too, easy to have handy in your bag.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love love love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m better off with safety pins.</li>
            <li>better than not having it</li>
            <li>but sometimes it sticks to my bra much better than it sticks to the shirt</li>
            <li>Many, many uses.</li>
            <li>I love hollywood tape.</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>I thought I had been successful in attaching it to my straps at first</li>
            <li>In addition, you MUST be creative with where you decide to place these as I think that is a huge factor in determining how effective the tapes will be.</li>
            <li>Also comfortable for your skin!</li>
            <li>I bought this to keep the top of my wedding dress from drooping and showing my bra.  </li>
            <li>Works on most fabrics.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t fund anything that works better.</li>
            <li>I love this fashion tape.  </li>
            <li>I use it all the time and was pleased that amazon sold it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it in my capacities</li>
            <li>Topstick is a better product for that use.</li>
            <li>I would give it 5 stars if I was able t use them</li>
            <li>It does allow you to remove it to straighten it, for example, just don&#x27;t do that too many times..  </li>
            <li>This is the tiniest and greatest but necessary invention ever!</li>
            <li>Seriously, I love these.</li>
            <li>Used this for a Navy ball and a wedding and was able to enjoy the festivities because everything stayed in place!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t hurt very much more than a bandaid when I took it off.</li>
            <li>Hollywood tape has so many uses, I feel lost when I don&#x27;t have it in my bag.  </li>
            <li>Keeps most fabrics fastened.</li>
            <li>it came in a cute packaging, but it doesn&#x27;t quite meet up to my expectation.</li>
            <li>As some people said, the tape works better with some materials than others.</li>
            <li>and they worked 1000x better.</li>
            <li>I love this tape.</li>
            <li>and I wanted to keep them under my tank top.</li>
            <li>I have been able to leave these on a blouse for more than one &amp;#34;wearing&amp;#34; and they still held.</li>
            <li>I love this tape.  </li>
            <li>I use it mostly on my bra</li>
            <li>Be sure to remove before washing.  </li>
            <li>Do not put any body lotion on prior to use and this body tape works perfect.  </li>
            <li>Stick better to some materials than others.</li>
            <li>Hollywood stood the test of time, heat, and sweat a lot better than the rest.</li>
            <li>but this stuff works much better.  </li>
            <li>I love the tin box design.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li>This is good tape and worth the money it will hold your bra straps in place</li>
            <li>are most of the &amp;#34;associates&amp;#34; don&#x27;t know its there</li>
            <li>This tape is amazing for the shirt that just doesn&#x27;t close comfortably in the front.</li>
            <li>I love these things.  </li>
            <li>Use it to keep your bra straps from showing on a top, or use them to keep your assets from popping out in a costume.  </li>
            <li>This is the best double stick tape, they perfected the process to affix it too.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t hold dress to well had to use more than one and change out durning the night.</li>
            <li>ITS OK FOR THE PRICE</li>
            <li>Maybe need some more practice</li>
            <li>Purchased Many times.</li>
            <li>We made sure that we followed the directions but the tape did not hold for longer than an hour or so.</li>
            <li>so you have to make sure you put it where you want it.</li>
            <li>Everything is okay unless I bend over to pick something up, and then the blouse opens.</li>
            <li>So much better than the tape dispenser options that are out there.  </li>
            <li>I bought these to try on two of my favorite tops that have neckline hems that come out.  </li>
            <li>Oops :)</li>
            <li>love this stuff, dont like all my straps showing, thats for my daughter .</li>
            <li>so glad to find it on amazon</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I can remedy that with some lotion maybe.</li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>
            <li>what more can I ask for?</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say which fabrics it works best on because I have two pair of pants made of the same fabric,</li>
            <li>the pair more heavenly worn (therefore washed more)</li>
            <li>At this time i&#x27;m using this tape mostly to keep my cleavage from showing when i&#x27;m at work, so the 1&amp;#34</li>
            <li>; width works better for me.</li>
            <li>One or two strips will not hold a top or dress up.</li>
            <li>It worked ok but hurt when I tried to take it off my body.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this tape in a roll to keep my top and dress necklines in place.</li>
            <li>I find it more convenient because I don&#x27;t always travel with a pair of scissors.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it works ok, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>This tape works better for some fabric types over others.</li>
            <li>I think using this tape creates a more polished/classy look......</li>
            <li>No matter what bra I tried, I could not find one that worked perfectly with my low cut dress.</li>
            <li>being said, I still give 4 stars because they stuck much better than I thought they would through the midwest August heat.</li>
            <li>Best double stick fashion tape on the market.</li>
            <li>I love them and shared them with my lady friends at work.  </li>
            <li>I love the strips over the rolls b/c</li>
            <li>Better than anything else we have tried.</li>
            <li>I love this tape, I&#x27;m never without it...</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>I did find tape at a better price.</li>
            <li>better for me.</li>
            <li>Toupee tape worked better</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>So, it has many more uses than just hemming tape.</li>
            <li>and it works great for her for that particular need.</li>
            <li>so you can hold it easily without touching the sticky part) and place the tape where you want it.</li>
            <li>Cute packaging, easy application and removal.</li>
            <li>the tape more easily adheres.</li>
            <li>It went on easily, stuck to both the dress and my skin perfectly for as long as I needed it, then removed easily as well with no sticky residue.  </li>
            <li>I had it on for about six hours before the first sock pulled free and to be fair</li>
            <li>I love it when I find a product that for a reasonable price does what it says it will, and comes in handy in many ways.  </li>
            <li>Hollywood Fashion Secrets&#x27; tape is so much better than the fashion tape from a certain popular lingerie store.</li>
            <li>Excellent for hiding bra straps and solving other wardrobe malfunction issues.</li>
            <li>I have used other products but this is the best.  </li>
            <li>of all, it&#x27;s easy to remove and toss when you&#x27;re done wearing whatever you&#x27;ve held together.</li>
            <li>and it came off the garment easily afterwards...</li>
            <li>It is also easy to use</li>
            <li>They are great for when you have a button-down blouse but need one extra button at the top to close the gap.</li>
            <li>It was so easy to apply and my shirt stayed in place all day.</li>
            <li>The tape is easy to remove.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-Tape is easy to apply and stays put</li>
            <li>It attaches easily and stays in place.  </li>
            <li>The backing tape is cut conveniently to get the backings off easily.</li>
            <li>Held the dress up,and was easy to apply and remove.</li>
            <li>Works as it should and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This brand is strong but easily removed after use.</li>
            <li>They are easy to shove in your purse.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, easy to come off</li>
            <li>She said that they were easily removed from her skin as well.</li>
            <li>easy to use once you get the hang of it</li>
            <li>They straps on anything are securely in place for the day and make me more comfortable.</li>
            <li>Has been great for keeping dresses and blouses appropriate for those of us who are larger busted.  </li>
            <li>Does not harm clothing and removes easily.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The tape comes in a strips that are easy to adhere and remove to skin and clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Fits in your purse, strong tape for almost any malfunction.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these strips on fine silk without issues.  </li>
            <li>However what I don&#x27;t enjoy is how easy they can slip off your shoulders or buttons get undone.</li>
            <li>This keeps my bra straps perfectly in place and hidden when wearing boatnecks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used fashion tape before &amp; was fine.</li>
            <li>and I have found the adhesive more than adequate to stay in place.  </li>
            <li>Super!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering more soon, so I can keep some in my purse for quick fixes and in my RV for traveling.</li>
            <li>good for some shirts not soo good for button down shirts</li>
            <li>I purchased these double stick fashion strips based on the positive reviews and they worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>My shirts fit fine</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this on several occasions now and am very pleased!</li>
            <li>this tape was fabulous...</li>
            <li>This stuff is great if you have a problem with your shirt front gaping and/or pulling open across the bust.</li>
            <li>so they fit between buttons.  </li>
            <li>and I almost think having a third would be great to carry along in my purse.    </li>
            <li>buy it again in this cute tin, which you can throw in your purse and it keeps the tape fresh.</li>
            <li>The tape was still secure by the end of the night.</li>
            <li>I used this for my rent the runway dress (you have it for a weekend, it might not fit perfectly) and this made it work so well!</li>
            <li>me feel secure in wrap dresses</li>
            <li>They come in a handy tin box which is prob why they cost as much as they do.</li>
            <li>I have also used it to secure my cushions on outdoor chairs</li>
            <li>The problem was the fabric was not forgiving for anything and finding underwear to fit backless and boobs were hell.</li>
            <li>keeps revealing tops securely in place.</li>
            <li>I have two light weight blouses that crisscross in the front.</li>
            <li>This tape is great for keeping blouses from gapping open between the buttons.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, worth the price if you want to be sure you can&#x27;t afford a wardrobe malfunction.</li>
            <li>I purchased these for my daughter to secure a formal dress.</li>
            <li>good old safety pin came to the rescue.</li>
            <li>I have pretty mixed feelings about this tape but the quick version of this review is that it&#x27;s very useful, makes a great stocking stuffer, is a handy tool to have in one&#x27;s purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>many times my tops don&#x27;t fit right, never again do I have to worry about gaping holes.  </li>
            <li>If you didn&#x27;t get it quite right, it&#x27;s better to just peel that one off and start over because it won&#x27;t stick as well after being adjusted.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I&#x27;m using it right now.  </li>
            <li>I really love the silky blouses trend right now.  </li>
            <li>The tin (read: sturdy) container is also great, as it&#x27;s about the size of a lipstick, so it tucks nicely in my purse - even a small clutch type.  </li>
            <li>Great for super low cleavages or bra straps.</li>
            <li>So useful to have on hand for wardrobe malfunctions!</li>
            <li>I am not a girly-girl, but this product has still been useful to me!</li>
            <li>the tape comes in is a perfect small size to carry in a purse.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them to keep cleavage from getting too out of hand, to make sure my wrap doesn&#x27;t fall back and expose my armpits when I&#x27;m wearing a sleeveless top, and to make sure my bra straps don&#x27;t show.</li>
            <li>I succeeded and it seems to work well on the first top that has thicker material.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be using this again in the future - love it!</li>
            <li>(Most button-up shirts were not made for women with large chests).  </li>
            <li>I also used it to keep a bridesmaid dress which was slightly to large in the top in place.</li>
            <li>I would recommend placing the fashion tape on clean skin, free of lotion, right after the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This tape works great for keeping my shirt from slipping on my shoulders or my bra being exposed.  </li>
            <li>And they do work great if you&#x27;re in a situation where you&#x27;re not intensely sweating.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really sweat, but somehow after putting on the tape, it doesn&#x27;t hold more than a couple hours.</li>
            <li>So-so, they are good for one time use only if you don&#x27;t sweat</li>
            <li>/&gt;It adhered to my dress and skin for the full 12 hours of moving, celebrating, and LOTS of dancing.</li>
            <li>This I found to be true.</li>
            <li>While this product is pretty strong, the material of the fabric you are sticking it to has a lot to do with how well this product will adhere; ie.</li>
            <li>This is a great idea in theory, but I didn&#x27;t find that this worked as well as other reviewers.</li>
            <li>I actually cut the strips in half to get more use out of them and they still work great!</li>
            <li>They were still super sticky even when I took them off after a 14-hour day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super sticky and nothing will move from where you place it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s super sticky and does not come off unless you purposefully take it off.</li>
            <li>I use these as a quick fix for hems.  </li>
            <li>I have not had a chance to use this produce but it came quickly</li>
            <li>I use it to keep bra straps in place, shirts on shoulders,even a quick hem on a borrowed clothing item.</li>
            <li>Overall I love love the tape and take it in my purse everywhere</li>
            <li>Better yet, the strips have easy to peel off coated covers on both adhesive sides like the most effortless first-aid strip,  and can be cut shorter to any length without being on an endless bandage roll.  </li>
            <li>Effective on both bare skin and clothing.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>For the average person it would  be great.</li>
            <li>Tape is very sticky but didn&#x27;t seem to damage my bra or clothing and came off easily.</li>
            <li>It sticks really well, is invisible, but comes off of clothes easily when you&#x27;re finished wearing them, and leaves no adhesive residue.</li>
            <li>But I did have overall pretty good success with this product.</li>
            <li>It never fails!</li>
            <li>Necessary for many dresses!</li>
            <li>The little tin it comes in is also great for carrying in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li>If you have a large bust, it may work for light duty, like keeping your top closed, but it does not work well when used for things like keeping a bra in place to make sure there are no accidents.</li>
            <li>Not as useful as I needed.</li>
            <li>So worth it</li>
            <li>It comes in a regular tape dispenser so you can choose any length you want this tape Hollywood Fashion Tape is a pre cut length of 2&amp;#34; but does come in a handy tin to throw in your purse in case you need to make adjustments thru the night.</li>
            <li>But this is worth the money and its delivered to your door.</li>
            <li>It secures all fabrics to make necklines more modest and to keep wrap dresses anchored so that there are no embarrassing moments.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>This was worth buying</li>
            <li>I was able to tape up a few bridesmaids into their dresses and also hem my own dress.</li>
            <li>I cut one strip in quarters (4 pieces) and was able to use either one half the strip (2 quarters) or one full strip (4 quarters/pieces) for my top, depending on the tank.</li>
            <li>I use it in some of my outfits, and for costumes and couldn&#x27;t ask for a better helper- other than magic.</li>
            <li>Product really works for me &amp; the item was economically priced &amp; delivered super quick.</li>
            <li>After a couple more hours of (hot, sweaty) dancing, they had rolled themselves into little balls that stuck to the inside of my dress and felt kind of scratchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe good for other use..</li>
            <li>right at my bust line.  </li>
            <li>Oh she was right.  </li>
            <li>Sweater won&#x27;t quite hand right?  </li>
            <li>For a smaller bust I&#x27;m sure it will work fine, but not for large</li>
            <li>I love button down shirts, but they don&#x27;t love me or my bust.</li>
            <li>I live in California and tried this around early January and February of this year where the weather was nice and</li>
            <li>Holds amazingly well and lasts all day long.</li>
            <li>I honestly doubt you could wear one tape long while doing some energy intensive activity from my experience.</li>
            <li>These are the best things for someone who is small in the shoulders and the top of your shirt keeps moving down.  </li>
            <li>My first use, an entire day of walking through the city, moving up and down and all about, and my shirt stayed perfectly in place.</li>
            <li>I had to buy a long dress for a particular occasion and the fit was such that I was just sure I couldn&#x27;t keep the strap up on my own.</li>
            <li>Removing them was not very painful and it did not irritate the skin.</li>
            <li>Perhaps too strong for sensitive skin it leaves a residue of glue on your skin</li>
            <li>and I think they actually had more success than I did.</li>
            <li>They worked great throughout the ceremony, but after an hour of taking photos outside they were definitely starting to lose their stick to my skin.</li>
            <li>Nice container, small and fits into purse for easy use.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I know young people expose them on purpose, but I&#x27;m older and like a more &amp;#</li>
            <li>Maybe my clothes were of the exact combination these don&#x27;t work with, but nothing like that is mentioned anywhere in the packaging.</li>
            <li>But overall FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>They worked perfectly - exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>They hold pretty well too.</li>
            <li>When it was too hot</li>
            <li>, I should have known to go straight to Amazon!</li>
            <li>This tape does exactly what I hoped.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So, if you couldn&#x27;t tell, I&#x27;m incredibly pleased with this product, and I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering it again.</li>
            <li>The only advice I would give is to make sure you wipe the area where you are planning to put the tape strips and do not put any body lotion on that area</li>
            <li>I ruined a couple trying to get the first one on.  </li>
            <li>On the second top, the material is flimsier and the strip bunches the material somewhat.  </li>
            <li>My bra straps had constantly made their way off my shoulders most of my bra-wearing life.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*It&#x27;s hot here in Georgia so sometimes at the end of the day</li>
            <li>They are so feminine and at the same time appropriate for work and party time.</li>
            <li>steep and double sided scotch tape seems like a better idea.  </li>
            <li>Best kept secret EVER!</li>
            <li>The fashion tape definitely gets the job done just make sure you&#x27;re thorough.</li>
            <li>It was worth it and much cheaper to get it off amazon than anywhere else.</li>
            <li>I used it so much!</li>
            <li>The tape holds very well!</li>
            <li>It kept its stick all day, even after a hot summer day.</li>
            <li>Ok, I have larger breasts..</li>
            <li>They do what they say they will ;)</li>
            <li>Keeps the gaps between buttons closed, and kept my dress in place nicely.</li>
            <li>This tape has made my life so much easier!</li>
            <li>Nothing noticeable as I have olive skin, something to consider for light skin/sensitive skin if you have to change the placement several times - though if you get right the first time it&#x27;s no biggy!</li>
            <li>I can move freely and confidently without having to look down all the time and adjust my shirt.</li>
            <li>It is very strong and you don&#x27;t have to worry about it coming loose during the day.  </li>
            <li>An absolute must have for holding outfits in the right place.</li>
            <li>Perfect for those little gaps in your blouse that never stay closed.</li>
            <li>Perfect for keeping those little gaps closed on dress shirts.</li>
            <li>But I seem to have trouble with the rolls quite a bit as they don&#x27;t always tear smoothly and you end up wasting more than you want to.</li>
            <li>It kept my dress perfectly in place on my wedding day, when it otherwise was slipping and messy looking.  </li>
            <li>However in terms of the fashion tape use for your shirt, I think it is very important that you have enough surface area available so that when you attempt to attach the tape to your clothes it ONLY touches your clothes.</li>
            <li>Even when I jumped up and down to the music, I looked down and was incredibly thankful that my dress stayed in place!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad they&#x27;re there and don&#x27;t worry if the strip is long.</li>
            <li>but I thought it might be more long</li>
            <li>I used them on a strapless top and they worked all day long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one of those women who often has a gap in button down shirts, and this seals it right up - and strong, too!</li>
            <li>I like that each piece is easy to peel open and can be cut to whatever size you want.</li>
            <li>It was also easy to pull off later.</li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t all that easy to apply, but for short term correction of that dreaded sliding bra strap issue, these do the job.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong enough to hold the clothing in place but easy enough to peel off.  </li>
            <li>I wonder if they would be strong enough to work on pant leg hems.  </li>
            <li>It does say not to wear for longer than a certain amount of hours or it will cause irritation.</li>
            <li>I have large breasts and this stuff doesn&#x27;t do a lot for me.</li>
            <li>These strips are sticky enough to hold any shirt in place and are easy to get off without too much tugging or pain.  </li>
            <li>It held my shirt together for the entire work day and looked so much more professional than a safety pin!</li>
            <li>I had very high hope for this product, seeing all the raving reviews, but my experience with it was substandard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve got a wardrobe malfunction like these, you need to have a  handy little packet of Hollywood Fashion Tape in your purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;d put the tape on my skin first then pulled the sock over it and had put the tape a bit too high.</li>
            <li>Good product but a little soft the adhesive</li>
            <li>Pretty easy to apply the double stick adhesive, and super simple to remove at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>I like to cut the strips into smaller pieces to fit my needs because I find that I don&#x27;t need the whole strip.</li>
            <li>These really work, they keep any blouses I have that fall open secure and in place.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>These tape items work really well</li>
            <li>/&gt;The one time it worked for me is when I used it to tape two parts of a skirt together to keep it from showing too much when twirling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really work.  </li>
            <li>but prom was inside) and I danced and got very sweaty.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>So this is very temporary and one time use.</li>
            <li>Not stick really well</li>
            <li>It really holds and works.made</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>Dress stayed secure the entire day and night.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work very well for me.</li>
            <li>I was adjusting myself the whole night, even changed the tape again during the night but didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li>The product worked really well and kept my clothesâ€‹ in place.  </li>
            <li>They work really well.  </li>
            <li>ready to remove, the tape comes off without damaging clothing or bruising skin</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this tape!</li>
            <li>The whole tin lasted me for a whole year before.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just cheap double stick tape.</li>
            <li>This tape does not stick to materials nor the skin well enough to feel secure that the clothing will stay in place.</li>
            <li>but REALLY did stick to me.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much time to really...</li>
            <li>, so I needed something that would really do</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really stick to fabric well.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how much I adore Hollywood Fashion Tape.</li>
            <li>I thought these would be a miracle solution---not so much.</li>
            <li>They are inexpensive and very purse-tuckable.</li>
            <li>Thanks to this tape, I no longer have this problem.</li>
            <li>The tape held fast, so it did the job.</li>
            <li>Very durable</li>
            <li>Does what it says, shipped fast.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>Keeps buttoned blouses closed and prevents my bra strap from showing with so many of my shirts.  </li>
            <li>Did not work very well for me.</li>
            <li>It really works I really recommend it</li>
            <li>so just make sure you stick it down exactly where you want it.</li>
            <li>These amazing little things have opened up a whole new wardrobe for me!</li>
            <li>I love how easy it is to peel the tape off the paper, since many brands make it almost impossible.</li>
            <li>These tabs are incredibly strong and hold for long hours - fabric to skin contact.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an avid salsa dancer at a local club and was looking for some way to keep up a cute red strapless dress</li>
            <li>This worked better than other clothing tape I have tried</li>
            <li>Definitely better than I expected and for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li>Since I live in Fl , I sweat most of the time, so when the tape gets wet the adhesive won&#x27;t work anymore.</li>
            <li>Need to use for special ocassions only.</li>
            <li>Easy to use - double sided clear tape.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used these to hold together 5 long window panels instead of sewing them together and they worked fabulously.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this to keep my shirt flat - the fabric between the buttons popped out.</li>
            <li>Keeps the buttons and seams all neat and clean and lying flat.</li>
            <li>so they don&#x27;t blow away as I live in a very windy area.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ridiculous how many wardrobe malfunctions I&#x27;ve corrected in the short time I&#x27;ve owned this, and how many embarrassing moments I&#x27;ve prevented.</li>
            <li>you want to use half of a strip, it is better to cut it as oppose to tearing off a piece.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t count on being able to rip them in half by hand, though.</li>
            <li>so i was particularly worried...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use them for super low cut tops or just looser tops to prevent peak-a-boo scenarios.</li>
            <li>The only change I&#x27;d make is to have the strips pre cut smaller, but they&#x27;re ok as they are.</li>
            <li>These tapes do a great job of keeping the necklines in place without irritating my skin, which can be sensitive.  </li>
            <li>As a woman of generous chest,  I can&#x27;t often wear button-down shirts, as if they are big enough on top they are ginormous elsewhere and look horrendous.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad Amazon has such neat items such as this.</li>
            <li>Bought these mainly for some of my shirts that seem to get the opening in the front when wearing.</li>
            <li>However, it is more difficult to remove the backing , so it takes me more time to apply the Hollywood tape.  </li>
            <li>I use in to hold my low cut tops in place and also to do a quick repair of a hem if I&#x27;m in a hurry and don&#x27;t have time to sew.</li>
            <li>If your big  busted (upper end of B or more) you need to use a lot of strips and pray.</li>
            <li>These are okay if you only need to wear them for a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Heels are so high now (5 in.)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this tape.</li>
            <li>I rated this high and would recommend it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Still, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend having this stuff around for lots of &#x27;fashion emergencies&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This little product has proved to be helpful in so many ways.  </li>
            <li>little boxes they come in are cute, almost like an altoids tin that you&#x27;ll want to re-use, and</li>
            <li>and I love the little tins that they&#x27;re stored in.</li>
            <li>I have a rather large chest, so I regularly use these kinds of products to secure various bits of clothing.</li>
            <li>It was only really sticky when first peeled off from the paper</li>
            <li>if you use make sure you take a few with you when you go out just in case it loosens .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad the pack came with a lot, as I&#x27;ve got a few blouses that gap between the buttons</li>
            <li>They stayed on me all night and they were not hard at all to put on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-The tin does not pop open unexspectantly during transport but is easy to open when you want to grab a strip</li>
            <li>I cut these strips in half since most of my blouse buttons aren&#x27;t spaced that far apart.</li>
            <li>tape itself came right on time, and I decided to take it for a test drive the next time I went dancing.</li>
            <li>Only used a few times but works great so far especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Final potential concern was that it would damage fine fabrics.  </li>
            <li>Thin smooth cotton shirts are fine.</li>
            <li>If you own neckties that are too short to run through the looped tag and don&#x27;t want the little ends to stick out to the sides, this is the answer.</li>
            <li>Cannot live without this stuff.</li>
            <li>Cant live without this stuff</li>
            <li>BUT I have VERY sensitive skin and almost everything does that.</li>
            <li>I work in a very professional setting and some of my dress shirts don&#x27;t always cooperate.  </li>
            <li>It was fairly hot (80 degrees outside</li>
            <li>And wow!</li>
            <li>I do not recommend relying on double sided tape, or the original, for any critical temporary fixes.</li>
            <li>Bring extra when you&#x27;re helping a bride get ready or going to a fancy event!</li>
            <li>I usually put the tape on my bra then put my shirt over top</li>
            <li>These little tapes are a life saver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removal is easy, just peel....</li>
            <li>The little tins are easy to carry in even smallest pocket for emergencies, like a snagged cuff or hem.  </li>
            <li>I use it to secure clothing to itself (button down shirts, etc.)</li>
            <li>I have found other uses such as filling in gaps left by my shorts second layer which has been pleasant.</li>
            <li>so I am not sure i did it the right way, shipping was pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Just be careful as I removed it from my skin too quickly one time and pulled my skin off too.</li>
            <li>I wanted to be able to dance and bend down and such without worrying about the consequences...</li>
            <li>Already I&#x27;ve used it to keep bra straps in place, hold up a top to avoid bra exposure, tuck in a loose string, help keep space between buttons closed, and close up a space between a ripped seam.</li>
            <li>Still, a little sting is worth a whole day of not worrying about the bra strap slide.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I would say it&#x27;s a nifty little tool that has more uses than simply helping a strapless bra stay in place.</li>
            <li>This hollywood stuff are hard to take the paper off but finding them at a better price .works</li>
            <li>Apply to clean oil less skin if applying to skin.</li>
            <li>One strip goes a long way and they stick pretty well to both skin and undergarments.</li>
            <li>They are sticky and will hold once you first put them on and will hold throughout the day, as long as you don&#x27;t need to readjust-</li>
            <li>So this is a need for me with my professional attire.  </li>
            <li>however it did not align completely</li>
            <li>It tends to stick to one side really well if left on</li>
            <li>I find myself giving away strips to friends in need quite frequently.  </li>
            <li>They also work well for garments that tend to slip off the shoulder or don&#x27;t cover bra straps completely.</li>
            <li>I use it frequently for the gaping that happens in the chest area.  </li>
            <li>I knocked a star off because doesn&#x27;t always last the whole day.  </li>
            <li>I put the tape on the inside of my bra around the strap itself and in the cup to make sure that stayed in place, and then put multiple tape pieces between the bra and dress and a few directly on my skin.</li>
            <li>I can use the tape on my skin above and to the side to hold the blouse where it doesn&#x27;t move much anyway.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Fast forward to the next wedding,</li>
            <li>the long version, the first time I used it was at a sorority event and all the ladies gathered around me to take some.</li>
            <li>adhesive doesn&#x27;t itch (I have sensitive skin) and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these almost every weekend thus far to hide bra straps.</li>
            <li>They did not hold my dress to me for more than a few seconds, if that !!</li>
            <li>Look into other brands for better quality options at relatively the same price.  </li>
            <li>so they don&#x27;t show, close embarrassing gaps in blouses (even if a blouse fits well, it still may gap between buttons), tape down tags in the back neckline of shirts, and I even taped the front of a light-weight fly-away jacket that kept blowing back when i walked, exposing my sleeveless tank top</li>
            <li>Not a big deal, especially since a single tin is packed with more than I&#x27;ll probably use in several years.</li>
            <li>Case is sleek and small, making it easy to fit into any small clutch bag.</li>
            <li>I not only recommend this particular Hollywood Fashion Tape, think they should remove it from the market.</li>
            <li>Although I admit it does irritate the skin and mine was left pretty red and sore afterwards.</li>
            <li>I have used it to keep a strap from slipping off my heel on a shoe, and for a quick hem when I am short on time.</li>
            <li>It works well as long as you really smooth it on one side before removing the other side of the backing.  </li>
            <li>once you unstick them, they lose their grip, so be careful when you first place them.</li>
            <li>Does the job and never ruins any fabric.  </li>
            <li>I have large breasts, so the result may be different for someone with smaller breasts.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These thin strips are easy to use, discreet, and they WORK!</li>
            <li>and I especially like the hard case that they come in now :)</li>
            <li>Granted, I tugged at it a little a few times out of my own paranoia, but this definitely changed my night from being uncomfortable and awkward, to making me feel a lot more confident and being able to let loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought the exact same one from somewhere else (slightly more expensive but Prime eligible).  </li>
            <li>It works fine, but with arthritic hands hard to manage.  </li>
            <li>Finally, I used this tape to get my dress taped down and it stayed secure the entire time -</li>
            <li>I generally remove the tape when I get undressed.</li>
            <li>I use fashion tape at least once a week to secure my layers for work outfits.  </li>
            <li>small enough to fit in a purse.</li>
            <li>It is too sticky, after u have it in for the whole day, its abit too sticky, and u need to be careful when u remove it, because it may cause redness to ur skin.</li>
            <li>A true necessity for the lazy.</li>
            <li>Because she is so young and the dress was very slippery, it kept falling down on her.</li>
            <li>I use it regularly to make button-front shirts less peekaboo, keep necklines in place, keep straps hidden, and much more.</li>
            <li>This is my first time purchasing such an item so other than my experiences with this product I do not have any reference points.</li>
            <li>Just like with other tape, however, once you apply it to your clothing, you can&#x27;t really readjust it.</li>
            <li>and I have had to purchase more a few times over, despite the fact that they give you quite a bit in this little tin.</li>
            <li>My daughter had to wear a bandeau under a bridesmaid dress recently, for modestly purposes since she is only 10.</li>
            <li>only ended up using about 4 pieces of the tape which were adhered directly to my skin/the fabric, and it worked for the entire nightâ€”no need to reapply strips or readjust the dress.</li>
            <li>use them as double sided tapes for general use too !</li>
            <li>The product I received it barely sticky and didn&#x27;t even last through my test-run at home.  </li>
            <li>However, anything softly woven doesn&#x27;t hold together long, as the tape eventually takes off some fuzz and pulls away.</li>
            <li>A push-up strapless bra (that usually falls regardless) with a tight red knit strapless dress with just a line of rubber along the top to keep it</li>
            <li>It is not very strong on fabric, I really have not tried it on skin.</li>
            <li>It comes off easily leaving no residue behind.</li>
            <li>I seem to be always having problems with tops, whether it be bra straps showing, or my bra showing by my armpits in tank tops, or low-cut tops showing my bra or a little too much skin.</li>

            <li> After reading all the great reviews on this product i was sure is was going to be a god sent!</li>
            <li> and I am a novice at using these, I will be fair and give this product 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Also good for keeping your bra strap in place.   </li>
            <li> These are the best way I&#x27;ve found to secure a wrap front blouse or dress.</li>
            <li> might be good for placing straps.</li>
            <li> They work just as good on skin as on cloth.</li>
            <li> You have to give the shoe a bit if a tug when you take it off as there is good sticking power, but you can get three to four wears from one strip.</li>
            <li> I used these as part of the mini gift bags for a group of bridesmaids and they all loved them.</li>

            <li> I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> Love Hollywood Tape!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I ordered it!</li>
            <li> Love!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> They work great and are easy to remove from the skin and clothes.</li>
            <li> For it to hold up that well under that kind of strain is pretty awesome!</li>
            <li> Omg, this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> I think these strips are amazing.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when I remembered that I have this amazing fashion tape.</li>
            <li> So many good uses for it,</li>
            <li> It has many uses and works really good.  </li>
            <li> Its also handy when you need to hem a skirt or pants in a bind.</li>
            <li> Was a bridesmaid in a wedding, and it came really in handy for all of the bridesmaids.</li>
            <li> Honestly this tape is a life saver.</li>
            <li> It also never ever caused any kind of damage or irritation to my skin.</li>
            <li> Also, Topstitch comes in nice 1&amp;#34; width strips, which i prefer to the 1/2&amp;#34; Hollywood tape.  </li>
            <li> The Hollywood Fashion Tape, This stuff really works great!  </li>
            <li> These are super sticky and work great, glad she recommended them to me!</li>
            <li> I bought it to help hold up some thigh high socks (not stockings) and it worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s would be great for evening gowns and/or cocktail dresses for a special night out too.</li>
            <li> I love it and have recommended it to many of my friends and even give them a strip to try before they buy to prove how good it is.  </li>
            <li> but it was very easy to peel off when the evening was over...</li>
            <li> I can place it under a garment, right on top of my shoulder or between 2 garments ( like a tank top and cardigan), with the sticky surface on top of or underneath the pad...whichever works best.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply, holds great, doesn&#x27;t damage clothes, and easy to take off.</li>
            <li> So far it works great!</li>
            <li> Still, it&#x27;s by far the best solution I&#x27;ve found for the problem.</li>
            <li> So handy with many uses - hems, cleavage cover, shirt gaps, bra strap alignment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great to hold my over-the-knee boots in place (for more than 7 hours, but in cool weather).  </li>
            <li> The small take-along tins are the best and I am so happy I got so many!</li>
            <li> Tapes keep clothing in place and remove easily when done!</li>
            <li> Strongly recommend!</li>
            <li> The shipping was also very fast which I was happy about.</li>
            <li> Fashion tape works well for a quick hem, but I&#x27;ve never been able to use it successfully for anything else.  </li>
            <li> It works awesome no matter how you decide to use it, on your bare skin or just to stick two pieces of material.</li>
            <li> Does not perform well on very smooth fabrics.</li>
            <li> I feel very comfortable that I am not going to twist my ankle or my heel</li>
            <li> Luckily I was good</li>
            <li> Love the nifty tin too, easy to have handy in your bag.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love love love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m better off with safety pins.</li>
            <li> better than not having it</li>
            <li> but sometimes it sticks to my bra much better than it sticks to the shirt</li>
            <li> Many, many uses.</li>
            <li> I love hollywood tape.</li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> I thought I had been successful in attaching it to my straps at first</li>
            <li> In addition, you MUST be creative with where you decide to place these as I think that is a huge factor in determining how effective the tapes will be.</li>
            <li> Also comfortable for your skin!</li>
            <li> I bought this to keep the top of my wedding dress from drooping and showing my bra.  </li>
            <li> Works on most fabrics.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t fund anything that works better.</li>
            <li> I love this fashion tape.  </li>
            <li> I use it all the time and was pleased that amazon sold it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it in my capacities</li>
            <li> Topstick is a better product for that use.</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars if I was able t use them</li>
            <li> It does allow you to remove it to straighten it, for example, just don&#x27;t do that too many times..  </li>
            <li> This is the tiniest and greatest but necessary invention ever!</li>
            <li> Seriously, I love these.</li>
            <li> Used this for a Navy ball and a wedding and was able to enjoy the festivities because everything stayed in place!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hurt very much more than a bandaid when I took it off.</li>
            <li> Hollywood tape has so many uses, I feel lost when I don&#x27;t have it in my bag.  </li>
            <li> Keeps most fabrics fastened.</li>
            <li> it came in a cute packaging, but it doesn&#x27;t quite meet up to my expectation.</li>
            <li> As some people said, the tape works better with some materials than others.</li>
            <li> and they worked 1000x better.</li>
            <li> I love this tape.</li>
            <li> and I wanted to keep them under my tank top.</li>
            <li> I have been able to leave these on a blouse for more than one &amp;#34;wearing&amp;#34; and they still held.</li>
            <li> I love this tape.  </li>
            <li> I use it mostly on my bra</li>
            <li> Be sure to remove before washing.  </li>
            <li> Do not put any body lotion on prior to use and this body tape works perfect.  </li>
            <li> Stick better to some materials than others.</li>
            <li> Hollywood stood the test of time, heat, and sweat a lot better than the rest.</li>
            <li> but this stuff works much better.  </li>
            <li> I love the tin box design.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> This is good tape and worth the money it will hold your bra straps in place</li>
            <li> are most of the &amp;#34;associates&amp;#34; don&#x27;t know its there</li>
            <li> This tape is amazing for the shirt that just doesn&#x27;t close comfortably in the front.</li>
            <li> I love these things.  </li>
            <li> Use it to keep your bra straps from showing on a top, or use them to keep your assets from popping out in a costume.  </li>
            <li> This is the best double stick tape, they perfected the process to affix it too.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t hold dress to well had to use more than one and change out durning the night.</li>
            <li> ITS OK FOR THE PRICE</li>
            <li> Maybe need some more practice</li>
            <li> Purchased Many times.</li>
            <li> We made sure that we followed the directions but the tape did not hold for longer than an hour or so.</li>
            <li> so you have to make sure you put it where you want it.</li>
            <li> Everything is okay unless I bend over to pick something up, and then the blouse opens.</li>
            <li> So much better than the tape dispenser options that are out there.  </li>
            <li> I bought these to try on two of my favorite tops that have neckline hems that come out.  </li>
            <li> Oops :)</li>
            <li> love this stuff, dont like all my straps showing, thats for my daughter .</li>
            <li> so glad to find it on amazon</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I can remedy that with some lotion maybe.</li>
            <li> I love the product.</li>
            <li> what more can I ask for?</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say which fabrics it works best on because I have two pair of pants made of the same fabric,</li>
            <li> the pair more heavenly worn (therefore washed more)</li>
            <li> At this time i&#x27;m using this tape mostly to keep my cleavage from showing when i&#x27;m at work, so the 1&amp;#34</li>
            <li> ; width works better for me.</li>
            <li> One or two strips will not hold a top or dress up.</li>
            <li> It worked ok but hurt when I tried to take it off my body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this tape in a roll to keep my top and dress necklines in place.</li>
            <li> I find it more convenient because I don&#x27;t always travel with a pair of scissors.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it works ok, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This tape works better for some fabric types over others.</li>
            <li> I think using this tape creates a more polished/classy look......</li>
            <li> No matter what bra I tried, I could not find one that worked perfectly with my low cut dress.</li>
            <li> being said, I still give 4 stars because they stuck much better than I thought they would through the midwest August heat.</li>
            <li> Best double stick fashion tape on the market.</li>
            <li> I love them and shared them with my lady friends at work.  </li>
            <li> I love the strips over the rolls b/c</li>
            <li> Better than anything else we have tried.</li>
            <li> I love this tape, I&#x27;m never without it...</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> I did find tape at a better price.</li>
            <li> better for me.</li>
            <li> Toupee tape worked better</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> So, it has many more uses than just hemming tape.</li>
            <li> and it works great for her for that particular need.</li>
            <li> so you can hold it easily without touching the sticky part) and place the tape where you want it.</li>
            <li> Cute packaging, easy application and removal.</li>
            <li> the tape more easily adheres.</li>
            <li> It went on easily, stuck to both the dress and my skin perfectly for as long as I needed it, then removed easily as well with no sticky residue.  </li>
            <li> I had it on for about six hours before the first sock pulled free and to be fair</li>
            <li> I love it when I find a product that for a reasonable price does what it says it will, and comes in handy in many ways.  </li>
            <li> Hollywood Fashion Secrets&#x27; tape is so much better than the fashion tape from a certain popular lingerie store.</li>
            <li> Excellent for hiding bra straps and solving other wardrobe malfunction issues.</li>
            <li> I have used other products but this is the best.  </li>
            <li> of all, it&#x27;s easy to remove and toss when you&#x27;re done wearing whatever you&#x27;ve held together.</li>
            <li> and it came off the garment easily afterwards...</li>
            <li> It is also easy to use</li>
            <li> They are great for when you have a button-down blouse but need one extra button at the top to close the gap.</li>
            <li> It was so easy to apply and my shirt stayed in place all day.</li>
            <li> The tape is easy to remove.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-Tape is easy to apply and stays put</li>
            <li> It attaches easily and stays in place.  </li>
            <li> The backing tape is cut conveniently to get the backings off easily.</li>
            <li> Held the dress up,and was easy to apply and remove.</li>
            <li> Works as it should and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This brand is strong but easily removed after use.</li>
            <li> They are easy to shove in your purse.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, easy to come off</li>
            <li> She said that they were easily removed from her skin as well.</li>
            <li> easy to use once you get the hang of it</li>
            <li> They straps on anything are securely in place for the day and make me more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Has been great for keeping dresses and blouses appropriate for those of us who are larger busted.  </li>
            <li> Does not harm clothing and removes easily.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The tape comes in a strips that are easy to adhere and remove to skin and clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Fits in your purse, strong tape for almost any malfunction.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these strips on fine silk without issues.  </li>
            <li> However what I don&#x27;t enjoy is how easy they can slip off your shoulders or buttons get undone.</li>
            <li> This keeps my bra straps perfectly in place and hidden when wearing boatnecks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used fashion tape before &amp; was fine.</li>
            <li> and I have found the adhesive more than adequate to stay in place.  </li>
            <li> Super!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be ordering more soon, so I can keep some in my purse for quick fixes and in my RV for traveling.</li>
            <li> good for some shirts not soo good for button down shirts</li>
            <li> I purchased these double stick fashion strips based on the positive reviews and they worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> My shirts fit fine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on several occasions now and am very pleased!</li>
            <li> this tape was fabulous...</li>
            <li> This stuff is great if you have a problem with your shirt front gaping and/or pulling open across the bust.</li>
            <li> so they fit between buttons.  </li>
            <li> and I almost think having a third would be great to carry along in my purse.    </li>
            <li> buy it again in this cute tin, which you can throw in your purse and it keeps the tape fresh.</li>
            <li> The tape was still secure by the end of the night.</li>
            <li> I used this for my rent the runway dress (you have it for a weekend, it might not fit perfectly) and this made it work so well!</li>
            <li> me feel secure in wrap dresses</li>
            <li> They come in a handy tin box which is prob why they cost as much as they do.</li>
            <li> I have also used it to secure my cushions on outdoor chairs</li>
            <li> The problem was the fabric was not forgiving for anything and finding underwear to fit backless and boobs were hell.</li>
            <li> keeps revealing tops securely in place.</li>
            <li> I have two light weight blouses that crisscross in the front.</li>
            <li> This tape is great for keeping blouses from gapping open between the buttons.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, worth the price if you want to be sure you can&#x27;t afford a wardrobe malfunction.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my daughter to secure a formal dress.</li>
            <li> good old safety pin came to the rescue.</li>
            <li> I have pretty mixed feelings about this tape but the quick version of this review is that it&#x27;s very useful, makes a great stocking stuffer, is a handy tool to have in one&#x27;s purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> many times my tops don&#x27;t fit right, never again do I have to worry about gaping holes.  </li>
            <li> If you didn&#x27;t get it quite right, it&#x27;s better to just peel that one off and start over because it won&#x27;t stick as well after being adjusted.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I&#x27;m using it right now.  </li>
            <li> I really love the silky blouses trend right now.  </li>
            <li> The tin (read: sturdy) container is also great, as it&#x27;s about the size of a lipstick, so it tucks nicely in my purse - even a small clutch type.  </li>
            <li> Great for super low cleavages or bra straps.</li>
            <li> So useful to have on hand for wardrobe malfunctions!</li>
            <li> I am not a girly-girl, but this product has still been useful to me!</li>
            <li> the tape comes in is a perfect small size to carry in a purse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them to keep cleavage from getting too out of hand, to make sure my wrap doesn&#x27;t fall back and expose my armpits when I&#x27;m wearing a sleeveless top, and to make sure my bra straps don&#x27;t show.</li>
            <li> I succeeded and it seems to work well on the first top that has thicker material.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be using this again in the future - love it!</li>
            <li> (Most button-up shirts were not made for women with large chests).  </li>
            <li> I also used it to keep a bridesmaid dress which was slightly to large in the top in place.</li>
            <li> I would recommend placing the fashion tape on clean skin, free of lotion, right after the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This tape works great for keeping my shirt from slipping on my shoulders or my bra being exposed.  </li>
            <li> And they do work great if you&#x27;re in a situation where you&#x27;re not intensely sweating.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really sweat, but somehow after putting on the tape, it doesn&#x27;t hold more than a couple hours.</li>
            <li> So-so, they are good for one time use only if you don&#x27;t sweat</li>
            <li> /&gt;It adhered to my dress and skin for the full 12 hours of moving, celebrating, and LOTS of dancing.</li>
            <li> This I found to be true.</li>
            <li> While this product is pretty strong, the material of the fabric you are sticking it to has a lot to do with how well this product will adhere; ie.</li>
            <li> This is a great idea in theory, but I didn&#x27;t find that this worked as well as other reviewers.</li>
            <li> I actually cut the strips in half to get more use out of them and they still work great!</li>
            <li> They were still super sticky even when I took them off after a 14-hour day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super sticky and nothing will move from where you place it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s super sticky and does not come off unless you purposefully take it off.</li>
            <li> I use these as a quick fix for hems.  </li>
            <li> I have not had a chance to use this produce but it came quickly</li>
            <li> I use it to keep bra straps in place, shirts on shoulders,even a quick hem on a borrowed clothing item.</li>
            <li> Overall I love love the tape and take it in my purse everywhere</li>
            <li> Better yet, the strips have easy to peel off coated covers on both adhesive sides like the most effortless first-aid strip,  and can be cut shorter to any length without being on an endless bandage roll.  </li>
            <li> Effective on both bare skin and clothing.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> For the average person it would  be great.</li>
            <li> Tape is very sticky but didn&#x27;t seem to damage my bra or clothing and came off easily.</li>
            <li> It sticks really well, is invisible, but comes off of clothes easily when you&#x27;re finished wearing them, and leaves no adhesive residue.</li>
            <li> But I did have overall pretty good success with this product.</li>
            <li> It never fails!</li>
            <li> Necessary for many dresses!</li>
            <li> The little tin it comes in is also great for carrying in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> If you have a large bust, it may work for light duty, like keeping your top closed, but it does not work well when used for things like keeping a bra in place to make sure there are no accidents.</li>
            <li> Not as useful as I needed.</li>
            <li> So worth it</li>
            <li> It comes in a regular tape dispenser so you can choose any length you want this tape Hollywood Fashion Tape is a pre cut length of 2&amp;#34; but does come in a handy tin to throw in your purse in case you need to make adjustments thru the night.</li>
            <li> But this is worth the money and its delivered to your door.</li>
            <li> It secures all fabrics to make necklines more modest and to keep wrap dresses anchored so that there are no embarrassing moments.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This was worth buying</li>
            <li> I was able to tape up a few bridesmaids into their dresses and also hem my own dress.</li>
            <li> I cut one strip in quarters (4 pieces) and was able to use either one half the strip (2 quarters) or one full strip (4 quarters/pieces) for my top, depending on the tank.</li>
            <li> I use it in some of my outfits, and for costumes and couldn&#x27;t ask for a better helper- other than magic.</li>
            <li> Product really works for me &amp; the item was economically priced &amp; delivered super quick.</li>
            <li> After a couple more hours of (hot, sweaty) dancing, they had rolled themselves into little balls that stuck to the inside of my dress and felt kind of scratchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe good for other use..</li>
            <li> right at my bust line.  </li>
            <li> Oh she was right.  </li>
            <li> Sweater won&#x27;t quite hand right?  </li>
            <li> For a smaller bust I&#x27;m sure it will work fine, but not for large</li>
            <li> I love button down shirts, but they don&#x27;t love me or my bust.</li>
            <li> I live in California and tried this around early January and February of this year where the weather was nice and</li>
            <li> Holds amazingly well and lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> I honestly doubt you could wear one tape long while doing some energy intensive activity from my experience.</li>
            <li> These are the best things for someone who is small in the shoulders and the top of your shirt keeps moving down.  </li>
            <li> My first use, an entire day of walking through the city, moving up and down and all about, and my shirt stayed perfectly in place.</li>
            <li> I had to buy a long dress for a particular occasion and the fit was such that I was just sure I couldn&#x27;t keep the strap up on my own.</li>
            <li> Removing them was not very painful and it did not irritate the skin.</li>
            <li> Perhaps too strong for sensitive skin it leaves a residue of glue on your skin</li>
            <li> and I think they actually had more success than I did.</li>
            <li> They worked great throughout the ceremony, but after an hour of taking photos outside they were definitely starting to lose their stick to my skin.</li>
            <li> Nice container, small and fits into purse for easy use.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I know young people expose them on purpose, but I&#x27;m older and like a more &amp;#</li>
            <li> Maybe my clothes were of the exact combination these don&#x27;t work with, but nothing like that is mentioned anywhere in the packaging.</li>
            <li> But overall FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> They worked perfectly - exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> They hold pretty well too.</li>
            <li> When it was too hot</li>
            <li> , I should have known to go straight to Amazon!</li>
            <li> This tape does exactly what I hoped.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So, if you couldn&#x27;t tell, I&#x27;m incredibly pleased with this product, and I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> The only advice I would give is to make sure you wipe the area where you are planning to put the tape strips and do not put any body lotion on that area</li>
            <li> I ruined a couple trying to get the first one on.  </li>
            <li> On the second top, the material is flimsier and the strip bunches the material somewhat.  </li>
            <li> My bra straps had constantly made their way off my shoulders most of my bra-wearing life.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*It&#x27;s hot here in Georgia so sometimes at the end of the day</li>
            <li> They are so feminine and at the same time appropriate for work and party time.</li>
            <li> steep and double sided scotch tape seems like a better idea.  </li>
            <li> Best kept secret EVER!</li>
            <li> The fashion tape definitely gets the job done just make sure you&#x27;re thorough.</li>
            <li> It was worth it and much cheaper to get it off amazon than anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I used it so much!</li>
            <li> The tape holds very well!</li>
            <li> It kept its stick all day, even after a hot summer day.</li>
            <li> Ok, I have larger breasts..</li>
            <li> They do what they say they will ;)</li>
            <li> Keeps the gaps between buttons closed, and kept my dress in place nicely.</li>
            <li> This tape has made my life so much easier!</li>
            <li> Nothing noticeable as I have olive skin, something to consider for light skin/sensitive skin if you have to change the placement several times - though if you get right the first time it&#x27;s no biggy!</li>
            <li> I can move freely and confidently without having to look down all the time and adjust my shirt.</li>
            <li> It is very strong and you don&#x27;t have to worry about it coming loose during the day.  </li>
            <li> An absolute must have for holding outfits in the right place.</li>
            <li> Perfect for those little gaps in your blouse that never stay closed.</li>
            <li> Perfect for keeping those little gaps closed on dress shirts.</li>
            <li> But I seem to have trouble with the rolls quite a bit as they don&#x27;t always tear smoothly and you end up wasting more than you want to.</li>
            <li> It kept my dress perfectly in place on my wedding day, when it otherwise was slipping and messy looking.  </li>
            <li> However in terms of the fashion tape use for your shirt, I think it is very important that you have enough surface area available so that when you attempt to attach the tape to your clothes it ONLY touches your clothes.</li>
            <li> Even when I jumped up and down to the music, I looked down and was incredibly thankful that my dress stayed in place!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just glad they&#x27;re there and don&#x27;t worry if the strip is long.</li>
            <li> but I thought it might be more long</li>
            <li> I used them on a strapless top and they worked all day long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those women who often has a gap in button down shirts, and this seals it right up - and strong, too!</li>
            <li> I like that each piece is easy to peel open and can be cut to whatever size you want.</li>
            <li> It was also easy to pull off later.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t all that easy to apply, but for short term correction of that dreaded sliding bra strap issue, these do the job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong enough to hold the clothing in place but easy enough to peel off.  </li>
            <li> I wonder if they would be strong enough to work on pant leg hems.  </li>
            <li> It does say not to wear for longer than a certain amount of hours or it will cause irritation.</li>
            <li> I have large breasts and this stuff doesn&#x27;t do a lot for me.</li>
            <li> These strips are sticky enough to hold any shirt in place and are easy to get off without too much tugging or pain.  </li>
            <li> It held my shirt together for the entire work day and looked so much more professional than a safety pin!</li>
            <li> I had very high hope for this product, seeing all the raving reviews, but my experience with it was substandard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got a wardrobe malfunction like these, you need to have a  handy little packet of Hollywood Fashion Tape in your purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;d put the tape on my skin first then pulled the sock over it and had put the tape a bit too high.</li>
            <li> Good product but a little soft the adhesive</li>
            <li> Pretty easy to apply the double stick adhesive, and super simple to remove at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I like to cut the strips into smaller pieces to fit my needs because I find that I don&#x27;t need the whole strip.</li>
            <li> These really work, they keep any blouses I have that fall open secure and in place.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> These tape items work really well</li>
            <li> /&gt;The one time it worked for me is when I used it to tape two parts of a skirt together to keep it from showing too much when twirling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really work.  </li>
            <li> but prom was inside) and I danced and got very sweaty.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> So this is very temporary and one time use.</li>
            <li> Not stick really well</li>
            <li> It really holds and works.made</li>
            <li> It works really well</li>
            <li> Dress stayed secure the entire day and night.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work very well for me.</li>
            <li> I was adjusting myself the whole night, even changed the tape again during the night but didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> The product worked really well and kept my clothesâ€‹ in place.  </li>
            <li> They work really well.  </li>
            <li> ready to remove, the tape comes off without damaging clothing or bruising skin</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this tape!</li>
            <li> The whole tin lasted me for a whole year before.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just cheap double stick tape.</li>
            <li> This tape does not stick to materials nor the skin well enough to feel secure that the clothing will stay in place.</li>
            <li> but REALLY did stick to me.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much time to really...</li>
            <li> , so I needed something that would really do</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really stick to fabric well.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how much I adore Hollywood Fashion Tape.</li>
            <li> I thought these would be a miracle solution---not so much.</li>
            <li> They are inexpensive and very purse-tuckable.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this tape, I no longer have this problem.</li>
            <li> The tape held fast, so it did the job.</li>
            <li> Very durable</li>
            <li> Does what it says, shipped fast.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li> Keeps buttoned blouses closed and prevents my bra strap from showing with so many of my shirts.  </li>
            <li> Did not work very well for me.</li>
            <li> It really works I really recommend it</li>
            <li> so just make sure you stick it down exactly where you want it.</li>
            <li> These amazing little things have opened up a whole new wardrobe for me!</li>
            <li> I love how easy it is to peel the tape off the paper, since many brands make it almost impossible.</li>
            <li> These tabs are incredibly strong and hold for long hours - fabric to skin contact.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an avid salsa dancer at a local club and was looking for some way to keep up a cute red strapless dress</li>
            <li> This worked better than other clothing tape I have tried</li>
            <li> Definitely better than I expected and for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> Since I live in Fl , I sweat most of the time, so when the tape gets wet the adhesive won&#x27;t work anymore.</li>
            <li> Need to use for special ocassions only.</li>
            <li> Easy to use - double sided clear tape.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used these to hold together 5 long window panels instead of sewing them together and they worked fabulously.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this to keep my shirt flat - the fabric between the buttons popped out.</li>
            <li> Keeps the buttons and seams all neat and clean and lying flat.</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t blow away as I live in a very windy area.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ridiculous how many wardrobe malfunctions I&#x27;ve corrected in the short time I&#x27;ve owned this, and how many embarrassing moments I&#x27;ve prevented.</li>
            <li> you want to use half of a strip, it is better to cut it as oppose to tearing off a piece.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t count on being able to rip them in half by hand, though.</li>
            <li> so i was particularly worried...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use them for super low cut tops or just looser tops to prevent peak-a-boo scenarios.</li>
            <li> The only change I&#x27;d make is to have the strips pre cut smaller, but they&#x27;re ok as they are.</li>
            <li> These tapes do a great job of keeping the necklines in place without irritating my skin, which can be sensitive.  </li>
            <li> As a woman of generous chest,  I can&#x27;t often wear button-down shirts, as if they are big enough on top they are ginormous elsewhere and look horrendous.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad Amazon has such neat items such as this.</li>
            <li> Bought these mainly for some of my shirts that seem to get the opening in the front when wearing.</li>
            <li> However, it is more difficult to remove the backing , so it takes me more time to apply the Hollywood tape.  </li>
            <li> I use in to hold my low cut tops in place and also to do a quick repair of a hem if I&#x27;m in a hurry and don&#x27;t have time to sew.</li>
            <li> If your big  busted (upper end of B or more) you need to use a lot of strips and pray.</li>
            <li> These are okay if you only need to wear them for a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Heels are so high now (5 in.)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this tape.</li>
            <li> I rated this high and would recommend it</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Still, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend having this stuff around for lots of &#x27;fashion emergencies&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This little product has proved to be helpful in so many ways.  </li>
            <li> little boxes they come in are cute, almost like an altoids tin that you&#x27;ll want to re-use, and</li>
            <li> and I love the little tins that they&#x27;re stored in.</li>
            <li> I have a rather large chest, so I regularly use these kinds of products to secure various bits of clothing.</li>
            <li> It was only really sticky when first peeled off from the paper</li>
            <li> if you use make sure you take a few with you when you go out just in case it loosens .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad the pack came with a lot, as I&#x27;ve got a few blouses that gap between the buttons</li>
            <li> They stayed on me all night and they were not hard at all to put on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-The tin does not pop open unexspectantly during transport but is easy to open when you want to grab a strip</li>
            <li> I cut these strips in half since most of my blouse buttons aren&#x27;t spaced that far apart.</li>
            <li> tape itself came right on time, and I decided to take it for a test drive the next time I went dancing.</li>
            <li> Only used a few times but works great so far especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Final potential concern was that it would damage fine fabrics.  </li>
            <li> Thin smooth cotton shirts are fine.</li>
            <li> If you own neckties that are too short to run through the looped tag and don&#x27;t want the little ends to stick out to the sides, this is the answer.</li>
            <li> Cannot live without this stuff.</li>
            <li> Cant live without this stuff</li>
            <li> BUT I have VERY sensitive skin and almost everything does that.</li>
            <li> I work in a very professional setting and some of my dress shirts don&#x27;t always cooperate.  </li>
            <li> It was fairly hot (80 degrees outside</li>
            <li> And wow!</li>
            <li> I do not recommend relying on double sided tape, or the original, for any critical temporary fixes.</li>
            <li> Bring extra when you&#x27;re helping a bride get ready or going to a fancy event!</li>
            <li> I usually put the tape on my bra then put my shirt over top</li>
            <li> These little tapes are a life saver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removal is easy, just peel....</li>
            <li> The little tins are easy to carry in even smallest pocket for emergencies, like a snagged cuff or hem.  </li>
            <li> I use it to secure clothing to itself (button down shirts, etc.)</li>
            <li> I have found other uses such as filling in gaps left by my shorts second layer which has been pleasant.</li>
            <li> so I am not sure i did it the right way, shipping was pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Just be careful as I removed it from my skin too quickly one time and pulled my skin off too.</li>
            <li> I wanted to be able to dance and bend down and such without worrying about the consequences...</li>
            <li> Already I&#x27;ve used it to keep bra straps in place, hold up a top to avoid bra exposure, tuck in a loose string, help keep space between buttons closed, and close up a space between a ripped seam.</li>
            <li> Still, a little sting is worth a whole day of not worrying about the bra strap slide.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I would say it&#x27;s a nifty little tool that has more uses than simply helping a strapless bra stay in place.</li>
            <li> This hollywood stuff are hard to take the paper off but finding them at a better price .works</li>
            <li> Apply to clean oil less skin if applying to skin.</li>
            <li> One strip goes a long way and they stick pretty well to both skin and undergarments.</li>
            <li> They are sticky and will hold once you first put them on and will hold throughout the day, as long as you don&#x27;t need to readjust-</li>
            <li> So this is a need for me with my professional attire.  </li>
            <li> however it did not align completely</li>
            <li> It tends to stick to one side really well if left on</li>
            <li> I find myself giving away strips to friends in need quite frequently.  </li>
            <li> They also work well for garments that tend to slip off the shoulder or don&#x27;t cover bra straps completely.</li>
            <li> I use it frequently for the gaping that happens in the chest area.  </li>
            <li> I knocked a star off because doesn&#x27;t always last the whole day.  </li>
            <li> I put the tape on the inside of my bra around the strap itself and in the cup to make sure that stayed in place, and then put multiple tape pieces between the bra and dress and a few directly on my skin.</li>
            <li> I can use the tape on my skin above and to the side to hold the blouse where it doesn&#x27;t move much anyway.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Fast forward to the next wedding,</li>
            <li> the long version, the first time I used it was at a sorority event and all the ladies gathered around me to take some.</li>
            <li> adhesive doesn&#x27;t itch (I have sensitive skin) and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these almost every weekend thus far to hide bra straps.</li>
            <li> They did not hold my dress to me for more than a few seconds, if that !!</li>
            <li> Look into other brands for better quality options at relatively the same price.  </li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t show, close embarrassing gaps in blouses (even if a blouse fits well, it still may gap between buttons), tape down tags in the back neckline of shirts, and I even taped the front of a light-weight fly-away jacket that kept blowing back when i walked, exposing my sleeveless tank top</li>
            <li> Not a big deal, especially since a single tin is packed with more than I&#x27;ll probably use in several years.</li>
            <li> Case is sleek and small, making it easy to fit into any small clutch bag.</li>
            <li> I not only recommend this particular Hollywood Fashion Tape, think they should remove it from the market.</li>
            <li> Although I admit it does irritate the skin and mine was left pretty red and sore afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have used it to keep a strap from slipping off my heel on a shoe, and for a quick hem when I am short on time.</li>
            <li> It works well as long as you really smooth it on one side before removing the other side of the backing.  </li>
            <li> once you unstick them, they lose their grip, so be careful when you first place them.</li>
            <li> Does the job and never ruins any fabric.  </li>
            <li> I have large breasts, so the result may be different for someone with smaller breasts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These thin strips are easy to use, discreet, and they WORK!</li>
            <li> and I especially like the hard case that they come in now :)</li>
            <li> Granted, I tugged at it a little a few times out of my own paranoia, but this definitely changed my night from being uncomfortable and awkward, to making me feel a lot more confident and being able to let loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought the exact same one from somewhere else (slightly more expensive but Prime eligible).  </li>
            <li> It works fine, but with arthritic hands hard to manage.  </li>
            <li> Finally, I used this tape to get my dress taped down and it stayed secure the entire time -</li>
            <li> I generally remove the tape when I get undressed.</li>
            <li> I use fashion tape at least once a week to secure my layers for work outfits.  </li>
            <li> small enough to fit in a purse.</li>
            <li> It is too sticky, after u have it in for the whole day, its abit too sticky, and u need to be careful when u remove it, because it may cause redness to ur skin.</li>
            <li> A true necessity for the lazy.</li>
            <li> Because she is so young and the dress was very slippery, it kept falling down on her.</li>
            <li> I use it regularly to make button-front shirts less peekaboo, keep necklines in place, keep straps hidden, and much more.</li>
            <li> This is my first time purchasing such an item so other than my experiences with this product I do not have any reference points.</li>
            <li> Just like with other tape, however, once you apply it to your clothing, you can&#x27;t really readjust it.</li>
            <li> and I have had to purchase more a few times over, despite the fact that they give you quite a bit in this little tin.</li>
            <li> My daughter had to wear a bandeau under a bridesmaid dress recently, for modestly purposes since she is only 10.</li>
            <li> only ended up using about 4 pieces of the tape which were adhered directly to my skin/the fabric, and it worked for the entire nightâ€”no need to reapply strips or readjust the dress.</li>
            <li> use them as double sided tapes for general use too !</li>
            <li> The product I received it barely sticky and didn&#x27;t even last through my test-run at home.  </li>
            <li> However, anything softly woven doesn&#x27;t hold together long, as the tape eventually takes off some fuzz and pulls away.</li>
            <li> A push-up strapless bra (that usually falls regardless) with a tight red knit strapless dress with just a line of rubber along the top to keep it</li>
            <li> It is not very strong on fabric, I really have not tried it on skin.</li>
            <li> It comes off easily leaving no residue behind.</li>
            <li> I seem to be always having problems with tops, whether it be bra straps showing, or my bra showing by my armpits in tank tops, or low-cut tops showing my bra or a little too much skin.</li>
            <li> It came loose in one major area before she even left the house.</li>
            <li> my poly-blend shirt is pretty thin; your fabric would have to be nearly see-through for this to show!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a long lasting effect (gone in 30 min)  or a deal breaker for future use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it to secure a particularly annoying top that gapes a little at the chest.</li>
            <li> I have used these to keep some pretty delicate dresses in place and they peel off the fabric with no problems at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even though 8 hours is a long time, it doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re wearing your outfit the entire day.</li>
            <li> so it last a long time.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re super tough.</li>
            <li> Ok, maybe \\&quot;life saver\\&quot; is a little dramatic, but this product is definitely a must in my book.</li>
            <li> LAST VERY LONG, AND YOU CAN SEE THE TAPE THROUGH SOME CLOTHING.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any issues with them messing up my shirts, even after leaving them on through the wash &amp; a low dry.</li>
            <li> It was really easy to apply and take off and wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable to wear</li>
            <li> I prefer this to the roll-tape version because that one left tape exposed to the elements and it would always either dry out or attract dust (and become non-sticky).  </li>
            <li> Tried it on one of my blouses last week and totally kept it closed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m small and large chested, and these actually keep my shirts closed.</li>
            <li> I mean it&#x27;s really just double sided tape after all,</li>
            <li> So that you don&#x27;t see that bra strap hanging out of your shirt, a loose hem can stay put until you have time to sew it back up.</li>
            <li> So, I bought these because I wanted to wear a strapless tube top to a concert and was afraid of it falling nonstop.</li>
            <li> so I was afraid it would irritate my skin, but it didn&#x27;t, so I&#x27;m pleased with that.  </li>
            <li> I have tried these only once so far and was not pleased with the result.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t make it stay glued for too long..</li>
            <li> I bought this tape for the specific purpose of keeping my tops from slipping via attachment to my bra/undershirt to shirt.</li>
            <li> The strips are far too narrow.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll have them for a long, long time.</li>
            <li> I had found this in a store a long time ago and found them again on here.</li>
            <li> This product works well to seal the gap and stay put all day long.</li>
            <li> The tape sticks well and all day long, but peels off without marring the surface of the necktie.</li>
            <li> We wore that 100 ways dress (the one with really long straps</li>
            <li> or to keep my bras&#x27; shoulder straps from showing in wide necked shirts (tack the tape on the outside of the bra strap and stick the shirt&#x27;s neck edging to the tape).</li>
            <li> I had a military ball last night and had a strapless dress that needed tape to stay to my body.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know how I lived without this for so long.</li>
            <li> I cut the (7.5cm long) strip into two and taped both sides to my chest.</li>
            <li> So, be careful experimenting, as you may find yourself showing not only gaps in a shirt</li>
            <li> the strips are fairly long, so I trim mine to sizes as needed.</li>
            <li> strip is long enough to cut in half for smaller jobs&lt;</li>
            <li> Must be meant for very very small jobs, but these strips did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li> Not a problem at home, but a little more difficult on the go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pat</li>
            <li> but also some strange looking tape!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t hold up very long.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think my body skin is oily or dry.</li>
            <li> so I am curious as to how long the tape would remain sticky if I had decided to stroll around the park for a half hour or just spend a long time outside.</li>
            <li> This fashion tape is pretty thin which makes it easier in the skin.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hold anything in place &amp; ended up rolling or getting g partially loose &amp; getting stuck to itself.</li>
            <li> It keeps button down shirts from pulling open in the breast region.</li>
            <li> I cut them in half (to about 1 inch) and this one order will last me a couple of years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coupled with this tape, however, 5 and a half hours of salsa dancing later, this dress was still up.</li>
            <li> Totally work for preventing wardrobe malfunctions or making a slight adjustment before going on.  </li>
            <li> As in it scabbed over and left a little bit of a scar.  </li>
            <li> its clear at least to me</li>
            <li> She felt free to move around knowing that her dress was not going gap in awkward places.&lt;br</li>
            <li> At least I didn&#x27;t get any allergic reactions or rash up since I have sensitive</li>
            <li> They stick enough to prevent unfortunate wardrobe malfunctions but not so much that your clothes pucker.</li>
            <li> The tape is thin and very flexible and so you can&#x27;t see it, even when I&#x27;ve used it on silk.</li>
            <li> you purchase this item, I would not expect it to last all day and would carry a few backups in your purse or wallet.</li>
            <li> This fashion tape worked as expected.</li>
            <li> I use it to keep my blouse closed.</li>
            <li> It worked miracles on hiding bra lines and keeping the dress from slipping and exposing what you donâ€™t want exposed.</li>
            <li> I used to have to carefully place safety pins on my tops</li>
            <li> /&gt;-The strips are protected enough that you can through a few in your wallet or pocket and leave the tin at home</li>
            <li> Not what I expected based on reviews.</li>
            <li> Having trouble finding something like this locally.</li>
            <li> I recently hemmed a few pants, a coat and kept camisoles in place, with this tape.  </li>
            <li> Could also be used in a pinch for I partially unsewn hem.</li>
            <li> A little bit of tape and everything sits flat and stays like that all day.  </li>
            <li> the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked around at various ways to keep something in check, from pinning the dress to a bra (which wouldn&#x27;t really help in my case), to other random fixes.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it is not strong enough to hold things together.</li>
            <li> I have a difficult time keeping a high heel or a sling back shoe on my foot as my heel slips to one side.</li>
            <li> It works well and is in such a nifty little travel case!</li>
            <li> I would rather have a long roll of tape instead of these little strips.</li>
            <li> Within a few hours or less, the tape wears out if used to hold material together, e.g., to &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; a too low cut neckline.  </li>
            <li> I even used some on my dress and passed them around to the other bridesmaids.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s covered on both sides - so you can place it where you want - take off one side, turn it over to \\&quot;stick\\&quot; then just peel off the \\&quot;top\\&quot; to stick to the other side of the jacket, pants, etc.      </li>
            <li> I no longer worry about bra straps showing or gaps in my blouse...or any other wardrobe malfunctions you can</li>
            <li> Then peel off the other side and attach to clothes</li>
            <li> The tape seems to be stickier on one side than the other.</li>
            <li> It works like its supposed to :) Go ahead and buy it you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Another FYI I have seen the other Hollywood products in Walmart over</li>
            <li> I kept a tin and gave the other one to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> Clothes stick well to other clothes, to bra straps, to skin, etc -</li>
            <li> I keep one in my room and the other in my purse.</li>
            <li> but it has lots of other uses as well.</li>
            <li> This little container goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I have found that you can cut the strips in half and use them to keep plaid (button-up) shirts -- closed.</li>
            <li> I think the strips are a little long for some fixes, but I just cut them in half.</li>
            <li> No more looking sloppy and disheveled when the look I&#x27;m going for is crisp and tailored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but if you look hard enough it is there.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this product, I was a little afraid that they were not going to stay all night, but they actually did.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that would prevent buttons on the front of blouses from gapping open, without having to poke holes in delicate fabrics with safety pins.</li>
            <li> I bought at least 5 from local ZARA store.  </li>
            <li> Having that gap at the bust in between the buttons really ruins an outfit and makes you look as if you don&#x27;t know how to dress yourself.</li>
            <li> They are really quite useless.</li>
            <li> I love boat neck shirts but hate that my bra strap always peeks out.  </li>
            <li> For the price of it, it&#x27;s not very cheap,</li>
            <li> Can hold a stubborn collar down how you want it or keep a capped sleeve from falling off your shoulder.</li>
            <li> I have tacked a collar down</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wear any button down tops unless I use this tape.  </li>
            <li> I use it on button down shirts as well as criss-cross shirts</li>
            <li> I have the hardest time wearing button down shirts.  </li>
            <li> On the down side - it can be a bit of work to remove the tape from your clothes but it does come off.  </li>
            <li> Had a strapless dress that would always slide down.</li>
            <li> Also tape it farther down on the edge against my skin.</li>
            <li> Bra straps falling down?</li>
            <li> Has not let me down yet.</li>
            <li> Not once did I look down and see my bra peeking out where it shouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Little tins can be reused for other things.</li>
            <li> I have trouble with my tops sliding to one side or the other and exposing my bra straps.  </li>
            <li> I shared it with a few other girls</li>
            <li> I have tried a couple of times to cut them in half</li>
            <li> so I can cut them in half and use one strip in two areas.  </li>
            <li> They were exactly half the price on here as they were at Jo-Ann Fabrics.  </li>
            <li> you must work to get off and irritated the skin slightly.  </li>
            <li> I do use shorter pieces than its pre-cut length, so I cut them in half with a pair of scizzors.</li>
            <li> I cut each piece in half as that&#x27;s all that&#x27;s needed and so one box lasts and lasts.</li>
            <li> Usually I use a small safety pin to pin it to my bra in the middle, but then the blouse doesn&#x27;t move when I do.</li>
            <li> This packaging is small enough to stick in even a small purse, in case of emergency.</li>
            <li> Tried to cut strips in half but had hard time not touching adhesive part prior to applying to skin and fabric.  </li>
            <li> But once it&#x27;s on, it will hold on tight and it won&#x27;t move for anything - sweat, friction, motion, nothing.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t that they work a little, or work for a little while.</li>
            <li> I keep one little box at the office and have one at home-</li>
            <li> It was a little tricky placing it</li>
            <li> I noticed some puckering/wasn&#x27;t laying how I wanted to, I noticed a little redness from applying and pealing 3 times.</li>
            <li> Used these little strips of tape and they keep the blouse shut.</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s easier to separate the backing from the tape due to there being a small edge of backing all around.</li>
            <li> I tried to use these a few times to keep bra straps and clothes in place while dancing.  </li>
            <li> My wife uses it almost everyday</li>
            <li> A few friends on Facebook also gave it glowing recommendations.</li>
            <li> I did re/try the placement a few times b/c</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> needed this tape to secures breast for a wedding and this product was an epic fail in that department...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for formal dresses as well as button up shirts for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> They look like a  narrow piece of double-sided scotch tape.  </li>
            <li> I used it to tape my costume to my skin to hold it up in a few places</li>
            <li> It was too thin and not sticky enough for the material of a bridesmaid dress.</li>
            <li> It stayed for a few hours.</li>
            <li> I use this product almost everyday to hold something in place.  </li>
            <li> A few sizes</li>
            <li> I already recommended this to a few friends.</li>
            <li> Since I discovered this a few years ago, I&#x27;ve never been without it.  </li>
            <li> I wear these almost everyday.  </li>
            <li> no more tugging at straps falling down my arms or peek-a-boo with my blouses.</li>
            <li> Sweaters that pull away just a little and show your bra strap are no more.  </li>
            <li> No more pulling up the shirt every few minutes.</li>
            <li> Need an open cardigan to stay closed on cold day?  </li>
            <li> I can just throw the little tin case into my travel bag and go!</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;ve been living in a cave after discovering these little miracles rather than using do-it-yourself surgical tape!  </li>
            <li> hard to get to stick on both sides -very sticky, but doesn&#x27;t always hold on fabric, was disappointed that it didn&#x27;t hold blouse closed</li>
            <li> They are a little hard to handle.  </li>
            <li> No more sewing hems on anything...</li>
            <li> Fashion malfunctions no more.</li>
            <li> not much more to say.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I prefer a small safety pin because it is stronger.</li>
            <li> You could even take a piece and tuck it into a wallet or something small, like that.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how it would hold for that purpose.  </li>
            <li> Overall I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> (no a size too small)</li>
            <li> I wore I completely low cut revealing too, and never once felt insecure.</li>
            <li> These are not sticky like the ones I&#x27;ve voight at VS in the past.</li>
            <li> I am petite and small and if I am wearing clothes that have lower neckline</li>
            <li> Hardest part is removing them when taking off before washing the garment - just rub hard and the tape starts to roll up and then can grab to remove.  </li>
            <li> Up until now I had been using safety pins and we all know how hard sometimes they are to getting it not to show.</li>
            <li> no matter how delicate.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t harm delicate fabric and has no residue.</li>
            <li> I do not appreciate this in the least.</li>
            <li> I use it on clothes and it doesn&#x27;t damage the fabrics even the mos delicate.  </li>
            <li> I have not tried on denim or any thick material.  </li>
            <li> In spite of my lack of experience I am still skeptical due to one side of the tape losing is stickiness and have attributed that to its inability to withstand friction.</li>
            <li> Finally no more blouses with busting buttons showing off my bra!  </li>
            <li> Not sure what I did before I found fashion tape!  </li>
            <li> No more!</li>
            <li> I use these every year for my  Mardi Gras ball gowns to keep the front of my dress where it should be if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers were correct when they said sweat can make the adhesive fail, but I still bought them anyway</li>
            <li> Then I figured that I would use it with some of my strapless sundresses, and it still failed to hold for longer than a half hour or so.</li>
            <li> (sleeveless is not a good look for me).&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Not a good idea to wear when you are going shopping or if you need to take your shoes off during the day.</li>
            <li> Not good to try to tape your boobs to create cleavage when going bra-less.</li>
            <li> So I had a wedding this past December in Cancun and the bridesmaids dresses wereâ€¦ complicated.</li>
            <li> The other brand I tried did not stick my clothes in place as well and also left a nasty sticky residue on both my skin and my clothes.  </li>
            <li> I found it very hard to use and gave up.  </li>
            <li> This product is very hard to find in my area, so I ordered it from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Mostly useless since it&#x27;s hard to apply.</li>
            <li> So I stocked up on stylist tape from Victoria Secret, Braza and Hollywood Fashion Secrets.</li>
            <li> It has poor adhesive qualities and did to stick my my skin or fabric where needed.</li>
            <li> My manual dexterity is not great which is why I don&#x27;t just sew things.  </li>
            <li> I hate it when I see women who have a button down shirt on and</li>
            <li> I also found it somewhat difficult to apply.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t work, don&#x27;t stick, were useless</li>
            <li> Absolutely useless.</li>
            <li> Thankfully her dress stayed up, but the tape failed.</li>
            <li> This was a fail.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect on everything, but what is?!!</li>
            <li> Lame</li>
            <li> There is not one bad thing I can say about these - except maybe that it SUCKS that I didn&#x27;t discover these until my forties!</li>
            <li> \\&quot;correct\\&quot; your dress while dancing without looking awkward</li>
            <li> Bit of an awkward gap in the shirt?</li>
            <li> worst mistake ever not easy to use, doesn&#x27;t hold on to any type of clothing.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for those tops the slide in the wrong direction!</li>
            <li> Sort of like taking off a bandaid, but not even that bad.</li>
            <li> but it is awkward to peel off which can get annoying.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Taking the tape off was hardly painful skin-wise.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t disappointed me or my modesty yet.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> This tape was very disappointing as it did not work for what I anticipated.</li>
            <li> So sad I didn&#x27;t start using tape like this years and years ago!!</li>
            <li> the front shirts to help with annoying \\&quot;gapping.</li>
            <li> Disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This company has the worst customer service I have ever had the experience of working with.  </li>
            <li> I have used Maidenform&#x27;s fabric tape and it is horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product twice but I&#x27;m very impressed! I needed to keep my blouses from gaping open or pulling apart (I wear an over-the-shoulder-bag and it tends to pull my blouses open where I prefer to remain discreet). With both cotton and polyester blends this product holds everything in place. I did not have the problem with &amp;#34;show-though&amp;#34; that some reviewers described and my poly-blend shirt is pretty thin; your fabric would have to be nearly see-through for this to show! I like that each piece is easy to peel open and can be cut to whatever size you want. I cut them in half (to about 1 inch) and this one order will last me a couple of years.&lt;br /&gt;Best of all, it&#x27;s easy to remove and toss when you&#x27;re done wearing whatever you&#x27;ve held together. LOVE THESE!!!</li>
            <li> I have not used this yet, it is for a wedding in June, but I have heard great things about it</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I highly recommend it! So many good uses for it, I.e., keeping straps in place, button gaps and temporary fix for hems.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love love love this product. Worked so well on curtains and didn&#x27;t even require ironing. No more sewing hems on anything...this does the job.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t that they work a little, or work for a little while. They just don&#x27;t work at all. They sort of adhere to your clothes, but then the clothes just fall away from your skin as if these stickers weren&#x27;t even there. Maybe my clothes were of the exact combination these don&#x27;t work with, but nothing like that is mentioned anywhere in the packaging.</li>
            <li> These tape items work really well, they even held on all day.  I would recommend them to anyone seeking double sided tape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy.</li>
            <li> This kept my dress in place and I use it on some of my blouses as well. Definitely works!</li>
            <li> I tried to use these a few times to keep bra straps and clothes in place while dancing.  Whenever I had to stick it on skin, the tape would very shortly separate from my clothes but stay on my skin.  Plus, it gave me a rash where it stuck to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one time it worked for me is when I used it to tape two parts of a skirt together to keep it from showing too much when twirling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.  I&#x27;m better off with safety pins.</li>
            <li> My wife uses it almost everyday and she loves it.</li>
            <li> better than not having it but sometimes it sticks to my bra much better than it sticks to the shirt I am trying to keep in place</li>
            <li> My daughter had to wear a bandeau under a bridesmaid dress recently, for modestly purposes since she is only 10. Because she is so young and the dress was very slippery, it kept falling down on her. I purchased these double stick fashion strips based on the positive reviews and they worked perfectly. I even used some on my dress and passed them around to the other bridesmaids. Removing them was not very painful and it did not irritate the skin.</li>
            <li> A friend told me about Fashion Tape and every thing she said is true - it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I use Hollywood tape quite often especially to keep a blouse from gapping open.  It is very strong and you don&#x27;t have to worry about it coming loose during the day.  It also works great to keep straps in place, hems on skits in place when you don&#x27;t have time to sew, jacket lapels in place, etc.  It does not leave any residue on your clothes and doesn&#x27;t hurt if you forget to remove it before you wash your clothes, it just comes off in the wash, no harm done.  It has many uses and works really good.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  I love it and have recommended it to many of my friends and even give them a strip to try before they buy to prove how good it is.  The product speaks for itself.</li>
            <li> this tape was fabulous...it held up all night...and it came off the garment easily afterwards...i had to use plenty so i was particularly worried...but it was very easy to peel off when the evening was over...</li>
            <li> Perfect for those little gaps in your blouse that never stay closed.</li>
            <li> 5 starts, you must have it!</li>
            <li> Am very pleased with this product - it works just as it says.  Holds up pants hems and jacket sleeves.  It&#x27;s covered on both sides - so you can place it where you want - take off one side, turn it over to \\&quot;stick\\&quot; then just peel off the \\&quot;top\\&quot; to stick to the other side of the jacket, pants, etc.      It was also easy to pull off later.</li>
            <li> Love this! Great for keeping clothing attached to skin, or clothing to clothing. Can hold a stubborn collar down how you want it or keep a capped sleeve from falling off your shoulder. Many, many uses.</li>
            <li> I love hollywood tape. One strip goes a long way and they stick pretty well to both skin and undergarments. I&#x27;ll use them for super low cut tops or just looser tops to prevent peak-a-boo scenarios. Dont&#x27; be stingy when using these. I have tried a couple of times to cut them in half so I could make them last longer but they dont&#x27; work as well when the strips are shorter.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great if you have a problem with your shirt front gaping and/or pulling open across the bust. A little bit of tape and everything sits flat and stays like that all day.  I do shorten the strips a touch so they fit between buttons.  I haven&#x27;t had any issues with them messing up my shirts, even after leaving them on through the wash &amp; a low dry. Love the nifty tin too, easy to have handy in your bag.</li>
            <li> These are great to have on hand and I have had to purchase more a few times over, despite the fact that they give you quite a bit in this little tin. It keeps your clothes in place basically. So that you don&#x27;t see that bra strap hanging out of your shirt, a loose hem can stay put until you have time to sew it back up. I have tacked a collar down that wouldn&#x27;t stay put. It keeps button down shirts from pulling open in the breast region. The tape is thin and very flexible and so you can&#x27;t see it, even when I&#x27;ve used it on silk.</li>
            <li> Hollywood fashoion tape is a a staple in my closet.  I use them on my button-down the front shirts to help with annoying \\&quot;gapping. I have used it to keep a strap from slipping off my heel on a shoe, and for a quick hem when I am short on time. This is great stuff, I will not be without it!!</li>
            <li> Does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> Ok, maybe \\&quot;life saver\\&quot; is a little dramatic, but this product is definitely a must in my book. Already I&#x27;ve used it to keep bra straps in place, hold up a top to avoid bra exposure, tuck in a loose string, help keep space between buttons closed, and close up a space between a ripped seam. It&#x27;s ridiculous how many wardrobe malfunctions I&#x27;ve corrected in the short time I&#x27;ve owned this, and how many embarrassing moments I&#x27;ve prevented. I keep one little box at the office and have one at home- and I almost think having a third would be great to carry along in my purse.    I think the strips are a little long for some fixes, but I just cut them in half. They are sticky and will hold once you first put them on and will hold throughout the day, as long as you don&#x27;t need to readjust- once you unstick them, they lose their grip, so be careful when you first place them. But overall FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> I bought this tape because my button-up shirts always gap in the chest area.  (Most button-up shirts were not made for women with large chests).  So this is a need for me with my professional attire.  It works well as long as you really smooth it on one side before removing the other side of the backing.  Plus, these are big strips so I can cut them in half and use one strip in two areas.  It&#x27;s just a great thing!</li>
            <li> Does not stick to skin. I tried multiple times</li>
            <li> These babies worked like a charm. They work equally as well on fabric to skin as they do on fabric to fabric. I will forever keep Hollywood fashion tape as my #1 accessory in my wardrobe. Fashion malfunctions no more.</li>
            <li> They worked perfectly - exactly what I was looking for.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Works great and does not show.</li>
            <li> This tape did not stick well at all</li>
            <li> I opened it and tried it because I have never used this things before and wanted to see how it worked... I couldn&#x27;t make it stay glued for too long.. I was in a rush so I am not sure i did it the right way, shipping was pretty fast. I will try to update after I use it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wear any button down tops unless I use this tape.  I love this product and I especially like the hard case that they come in now :)</li>
            <li> We are very happy with every thing.</li>
            <li> A true necessity for the lazy. Hems pants in seconds.</li>
            <li> This is my first time purchasing such an item so other than my experiences with this product I do not have any reference points. I bought this tape for the specific purpose of keeping my tops from slipping via attachment to my bra/undershirt to shirt. I have found other uses such as filling in gaps left by my shorts second layer which has been pleasant. However in terms of the fashion tape use for your shirt, I think it is very important that you have enough surface area available so that when you attempt to attach the tape to your clothes it ONLY touches your clothes. I thought I had been successful in attaching it to my straps at first however it did not align completely therefore it had been rubbing against my skin all day until it just decided to give. And boy did it give at an embarrassing time. When I went to the bathroom to check only one side of the tape was still sticky to my dismay so it was virtually useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you purchase this item, I would not expect it to last all day and would carry a few backups in your purse or wallet. In addition, you MUST be creative with where you decide to place these as I think that is a huge factor in determining how effective the tapes will be. Considering that the tape had helped me the majority of the day (about 8 hours) and I am a novice at using these, I will be fair and give this product 4 stars. In spite of my lack of experience I am still skeptical due to one side of the tape losing is stickiness and have attributed that to its inability to withstand friction. Aside from walking around a bit I did not do a lot so I am curious as to how long the tape would remain sticky if I had decided to stroll around the park for a half hour or just spend a long time outside. I honestly doubt you could wear one tape long while doing some energy intensive activity from my experience. Even though 8 hours is a long time, it doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re wearing your outfit the entire day.</li>
            <li> great product and great container to make it portable. The only change I&#x27;d make is to have the strips pre cut smaller, but they&#x27;re ok as they are. At home I use scissors to cut them and if I have an emergency outside the house I&#x27;m just glad they&#x27;re there and don&#x27;t worry if the strip is long.</li>
            <li> This tape is great. It works well and is in such a nifty little travel case! I can just throw the little tin case into my travel bag and go! I don&#x27;t have to worry about the tape flying everywhere all over my bags. Tape works well! So useful to have on hand for wardrobe malfunctions!</li>
            <li> The product I received it barely sticky and didn&#x27;t even last through my test-run at home.  I also found it somewhat difficult to apply.  And no, I wasn&#x27;t all lotioned up when I tried them.</li>
            <li> Perfect!  Just what I needed for those tops the slide in the wrong direction!</li>
            <li> This fashion tape worked as expected.</li>
            <li> Why didn&#x27;t I know about these before now?  I no longer worry about bra straps showing or gaps in my blouse...or any other wardrobe malfunctions you can imagine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  I have not Pplied these to my skin...only to my undergarments.  This method works great.</li>
            <li> These things working amazing! I wore them for prom, and continue to wear them in spaghetti tops, halter tops, tube tops, etc.</li>
            <li> Worked amazing! Taped inside my dress and stayed all night. Also comfortable for your skin!</li>
            <li> Not as useful as I needed.</li>
            <li> I bought this to keep the top of my wedding dress from drooping and showing my bra.  It didn&#x27;t really work.  It just didn&#x27;t stick to anything.</li>
            <li> I love it! its clear at least to me it did not give me any rash it does not hurt when taking it off which is a plus.</li>
            <li> Best clothing tape Ive tried. Works on most fabrics. Nice container, small and fits into purse for easy use.</li>
            <li> Finally no more blouses with busting buttons showing off my bra!  Such a simple idea but works so well and does not seem to hurt the fabrics - no matter how delicate.  Hardest part is removing them when taking off before washing the garment - just rub hard and the tape starts to roll up and then can grab to remove.  I will never be without them again!</li>
            <li> My favorite clothing tape! Haven&#x27;t fund anything that works better.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I don&#x27;t know how I ever survived without it! It does the job beautifully and is easy to remove from your clothing at the end of the day. Perfect for keeping those little gaps closed on dress shirts.</li>
            <li> I use it to keep my blouse closed. It&#x27;s great. I&#x27;ve been using them for years. not much more to say.</li>
            <li> Does not stick to cloth as well as I had hoped. Tried to use it to hold strap up on sling back shoe. Did not work. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love this fashion tape.  I use it all the time and was pleased that amazon sold it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it in my capacities and it&#x27;s my go to!</li>
            <li> The strips are far too narrow. Especially to hold your breasts  away from showing in a low cut dress. Topstick is a better product for that use. Very very disappointed. Maybe good for other use..but I doubt it. J B</li>
            <li> I have arthritis in both hands so I couldn&#x27;t use them.  I would give it 5 stars if I was able t use them</li>
            <li> If you have a large bust, it may work for light duty, like keeping your top closed, but it does not work well when used for things like keeping a bra in place to make sure there are no accidents. For a smaller bust I&#x27;m sure it will work fine, but not for large</li>
            <li> Great!! Sticks well on clothes and skin! I use it all the time!!</li>
            <li> Product came as described and on time! I love it and cant wait to try it out and see if it works well.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that would prevent buttons on the front of blouses from gapping open, without having to poke holes in delicate fabrics with safety pins. The fashion tape is perfect. A few friends on Facebook also gave it glowing recommendations. The little tin it comes in is also great for carrying in my makeup bag. It sticks well and holds all day. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t work so well if you peel the plastic off and touch the adhesive when placing it on your skin close.&lt;br /&gt;The proper way to apply is to peel off the blank side first and hold on to the printed side (the tabs of the printed side extend past the edge of the tape so you can hold it easily without touching the sticky part) and place the tape where you want it. Then peel off the other side and attach to clothes/skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you attach it, that&#x27;s where it&#x27;s gonna be.  If you didn&#x27;t get it quite right, it&#x27;s better to just peel that one off and start over because it won&#x27;t stick as well after being adjusted. But once it&#x27;s on, it will hold on tight and it won&#x27;t move for anything - sweat, friction, motion, nothing.  These little tapes are a life saver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removal is easy, just peel.... They do hurt quite a bit to remove (think peeling off bandaids as a kid) but that&#x27;s the price you pay for getting clothes to stay where you want them.  That said, I have yet to have any issue at all removing them from my clothes.  I have used these to keep some pretty delicate dresses in place and they peel off the fabric with no problems at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think a million come in a tin so they are plenty to practice with and you&#x27;ll have them for a long, long time.</li>
            <li> This little product has proved to be helpful in so many ways.  I love it when I find a product that for a reasonable price does what it says it will, and comes in handy in many ways.  I have used it to anchor bra straps so they don&#x27;t show, close embarrassing gaps in blouses (even if a blouse fits well, it still may gap between buttons), tape down tags in the back neckline of shirts, and I even taped the front of a light-weight fly-away jacket that kept blowing back when i walked, exposing my sleeveless tank top (sleeveless is not a good look for me).&lt;br /&gt;Will buy it again in this cute tin, which you can throw in your purse and it keeps the tape fresh. It is also easy to use and I have found the adhesive more than adequate to stay in place.  It does allow you to remove it to straighten it, for example, just don&#x27;t do that too many times..  Just remember to remove it before you launder the clothing item, or you&#x27;ll get gummy balls on the side of your dryer.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it is not strong enough to hold things together. I have had a bit of gaping, some waving and unevenness. The tape seems to be stickier on one side than the other.I sometimes double them to make them stronger. Also one should take it off immediately from clothing after use. It tends to stick to one side really well if left on and you may have some difficulty removing it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not going to keep the hem up on a dress, but it does well to keep your dress close to your skin if you apply fabric to skin.</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;ve been living in a cave after discovering these little miracles rather than using do-it-yourself surgical tape!  The stickiness is excellent and will stay put on fabric and skin until you remove them...and ouchless!  Better yet, the strips have easy to peel off coated covers on both adhesive sides like the most effortless first-aid strip,  and can be cut shorter to any length without being on an endless bandage roll.  The little tins are easy to carry in even smallest pocket for emergencies, like a snagged cuff or hem.  This is the tiniest and greatest but necessary invention ever!</li>
            <li> I read about this product in a magazine.  I knew I had to try them.  They worked great for me.  And the adhesive did not cause any skin issues.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I survived without fashion tape, lol!   Seriously, I love these. They are great for when you have a button-down blouse but need one extra button at the top to close the gap. The tape works perfect! No extra button needed after all! Also good for keeping your bra strap in place.   They hold pretty well too. I actually cut the strips in half to get more use out of them and they still work great!</li>
            <li> Used this for a Navy ball and a wedding and was able to enjoy the festivities because everything stayed in place!</li>
            <li> I wore this to prom on the sides of my dress so I wouldn&#x27;t have any accidental wardrobe malfunctions. My dress was made out of polyester and spandex. It was fairly hot (80 degrees outside but prom was inside) and I danced and got very sweaty. The tape was still secure by the end of the night. It didn&#x27;t hurt very much more than a bandaid when I took it off. It was a little tricky placing it so just make sure you stick it down exactly where you want it. Overall I would recommend this to anyone and everyone!</li>
            <li> I had found this in a store a long time ago and found them again on here. These work perfectly for making sure your bra stays tucked away.</li>
            <li> Hollywood tape has so many uses, I feel lost when I don&#x27;t have it in my bag.  I find myself giving away strips to friends in need quite frequently.  Once you try it, you can&#x27;t do without it!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Use these alot..love them to hold shirts in place.</li>
            <li> This are life savers. They work great and are easy to remove from the skin and clothes. They don&#x27;t leave any marks on the clothes and I even washed one with some of this on and didn&#x27;t ruin my blouse. Great for super low cleavages or bra straps.</li>
            <li> I got this product for some button-up garments that pucker open around the chest area. This product works well to seal the gap and stay put all day long. They also work well for garments that tend to slip off the shoulder or don&#x27;t cover bra straps completely. The tape sticks well to fabric and stays in place.</li>
            <li> Well, they worked. But they also ripped my skin off. As in it scabbed over and left a little bit of a scar.  Maybe it was just me.</li>
            <li> Always been a fan, I don&#x27;t want to be caught without a supply.  Keeps most fabrics fastened. I couldn&#x27;t wear some of my blouses with out it.</li>
            <li> I used these for arm length sleeves and the strips kept them on all day, through sweat, partying, and a spill here and there. They were still super sticky even when I took them off after a 14-hour day. I even used them for my sister&#x27;s wedding dress when some lace ripped. They went up and beyond expectations to keep everything together for her big day.</li>
            <li> I had very high hope for this product, seeing all the raving reviews, but my experience with it was substandard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think my body skin is oily or dry. I&#x27;m not hairy and I don&#x27;t really sweat, but somehow after putting on the tape, it doesn&#x27;t hold more than a couple hours. I live in California and tried this around early January and February of this year where the weather was nice and cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also had one incident where once I tried to remove it to adjust it, it stopped being sticky and I had to use another tape! So this is very temporary and one time use. It was only really sticky when first peeled off from the paper so I don&#x27;t understand why it had such a short adhesive power. For the price of it, it&#x27;s not very cheap, I mean it&#x27;s really just double sided tape after all, but I thought it might be more long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like that it came in a cute packaging, but it doesn&#x27;t quite meet up to my expectation. As some people said, the tape works better with some materials than others. At least I didn&#x27;t get any allergic reactions or rash up since I have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would be looking for a replacement once I use this up.</li>
            <li> So, I bought these because I wanted to wear a strapless tube top to a concert and was afraid of it falling nonstop. Well before the concert I was trying on my outfit and used these and they didn&#x27;t seem to work that well. Well, the day of the concert I showered two hours before I left and then used these and they worked 1000x better. These worked through a sweaty, 5 hour rave, so I think that they&#x27;ll work through anything if you don&#x27;t have any lotion or oils on your skin.</li>
            <li> This is my second time buying these.  They were exactly half the price on here as they were at Jo-Ann Fabrics.  I use these all the time.  I use then for sticking low cut, cowl V slinky tank tops to my cleavage and I also use them for giving my slacks a temporary hem.  Heels are so high now (5 in.) that it&#x27;s the only way you can wear the same pair of pants with both heels and flats and have then look tailored.</li>
            <li> I used this product for a very low cut flapper-style dress I wore to a wedding. I wanted to be able to dance and bend down and such without worrying about the consequences...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only ended up using about 4 pieces of the tape which were adhered directly to my skin/the fabric, and it worked for the entire nightâ€”no need to reapply strips or readjust the dress. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t all that easy to apply, but for short term correction of that dreaded sliding bra strap issue, these do the job.</li>
            <li> This tape sticks well but it is awkward to peel off which can get annoying.</li>
            <li> Not stick really well</li>
            <li> An absolute must have for holding outfits in the right place. These tabs are incredibly strong and hold for long hours - fabric to skin contact.  I used them on a deep v silk dress, and no damage to fabric. I did re/try the placement a few times b/c I noticed some puckering/wasn&#x27;t laying how I wanted to, I noticed a little redness from applying and pealing 3 times. Nothing noticeable as I have olive skin, something to consider for light skin/sensitive skin if you have to change the placement several times - though if you get right the first time it&#x27;s no biggy!</li>
            <li> This company has the worst customer service I have ever had the experience of working with.  I never received my items and after severel phone calls to the company, not only did I only get an answering machine every time but never once did I get a return phone call.  It has been almost 5 weeks and I still don&#x27;t have my items or my money back.</li>
            <li> This does not adhere to clothing at all.  I wore a basic cotton dress and it did not keep it in place.</li>
            <li> I used this today to keep a wide-collared shirt in place so that my bra straps didn&#x27;t show at work. And wow! It was so easy to apply and my shirt stayed in place all day. I seem to be always having problems with tops, whether it be bra straps showing, or my bra showing by my armpits in tank tops, or low-cut tops showing my bra or a little too much skin. I feel like that problem is solved now. So sad I didn&#x27;t start using tape like this years and years ago!!</li>
            <li> These are the best way I&#x27;ve found to secure a wrap front blouse or dress. Pretty easy to apply the double stick adhesive, and super simple to remove at the end of the day. And there&#x27;s no mark left on the fabric. Super!</li>
            <li> It works like its supposed to :) Go ahead and buy it you wont be disappointed. Used it only once though.</li>
            <li> Perhaps too strong for sensitive skin it leaves a residue of glue on your skin you must work to get off and irritated the skin slightly.  Need to use for special ocassions only.</li>
            <li> If you own neckties that are too short to run through the looped tag and don&#x27;t want the little ends to stick out to the sides, this is the answer. The tape sticks well and all day long, but peels off without marring the surface of the necktie.</li>
            <li> I used this for my rent the runway dress (you have it for a weekend, it might not fit perfectly) and this made it work so well!</li>
            <li> I love this tape. It held my shirt together for the entire work day and looked so much more professional than a safety pin!</li>
            <li> I used this to wear with my tank tops because my bra straps would creep out while wearing my tanks and I wanted to keep them under my tank top. I cut one strip in quarters (4 pieces) and was able to use either one half the strip (2 quarters) or one full strip (4 quarters/pieces) for my top, depending on the tank. Worked like a charm.  I can tell that this is a product I will be stocking up on. I&#x27;m hoping they&#x27;ll work great on skin too for a strapless dress. A friend said she uses them to hide the gaps between her blouse buttons and it works great for her for that particular need. Tape is very sticky but didn&#x27;t seem to damage my bra or clothing and came off easily.</li>
            <li> I have been able to leave these on a blouse for more than one &amp;#34;wearing&amp;#34; and they still held. Sometimes I prefer a small safety pin because it is stronger.</li>
            <li> For a big busted girl wearing a v-neck this is the product!  It really holds and works.made me feel secure in wrap dresses</li>
            <li> I have trouble with my tops sliding to one side or the other and exposing my bra straps.  I know young people expose them on purpose, but I&#x27;m older and like a more &amp;#34;pulled together&amp;#34; look.  These tapes do a great job of keeping the necklines in place without irritating my skin, which can be sensitive.  I&#x27;ll be ordering more soon, so I can keep some in my purse for quick fixes and in my RV for traveling.</li>
            <li> I am not a girly-girl, but this product has still been useful to me! I have found that you can cut the strips in half and use them to keep plaid (button-up) shirts -- closed.</li>
            <li> Must be meant for very very small jobs, but these strips did absolutely nothing for me. They come in a handy tin box which is prob why they cost as much as they do.</li>
            <li> Hollywood Fashion Secrets&#x27; tape is so much better than the fashion tape from a certain popular lingerie store. I use it regularly to make button-front shirts less peekaboo, keep necklines in place, keep straps hidden, and much more. I highly recommend this tape. It hasn&#x27;t disappointed me or my modesty yet.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say this was perfect. But I did have overall pretty good success with this product. I shared it with a few other girls and I think they actually had more success than I did.</li>
            <li> I love this tape.  It works really well I use it mostly on my bra so my blouse neckline doesn&#x27;t slip.  I have also used it to secure my cushions on outdoor chairs so they don&#x27;t blow away as I live in a very windy area.  It doesn&#x27;t take but 1 piece of tape to do this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this on my skin, but to keep some blouses from flashing everyone. Works. Sticks until I remove it.  Be sure to remove before washing.  I generally remove the tape when I get undressed.</li>
            <li> I have tried these only once so far and was not pleased with the result. I had to continually press my shirt and bra strap together at the contact point of these strips. I will try them again and give them another go, but for now, I cannot recommend them.</li>
            <li> Do not put any body lotion on prior to use and this body tape works perfect.  Dress stayed secure the entire day and night.</li>
            <li> They definitely work as advertised. They stick enough to prevent unfortunate wardrobe malfunctions but not so much that your clothes pucker. My only gripe is that the peeling the backing off is a bit of a hassle.</li>
            <li> Only used a few times but works great so far especially for the price. Stick better to some materials than others.</li>
            <li> It works at times.It has done the job on some occasions,taping my dress to my bra and stuff like that but it doesn&#x27;t do anything for skirts riding up or skin contact</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t stick to anything I&#x27;ve tried. Waste of money. Back to safety pins.</li>
            <li> So I had a wedding this past December in Cancun and the bridesmaids dresses wereâ€¦ complicated. We wore that 100 ways dress (the one with really long straps and you can wear backless, halter, one shoulder, etc.) The problem was the fabric was not forgiving for anything and finding underwear to fit backless and boobs were hell. So I stocked up on stylist tape from Victoria Secret, Braza and Hollywood Fashion Secrets. Hollywood stood the test of time, heat, and sweat a lot better than the rest. It worked miracles on hiding bra lines and keeping the dress from slipping and exposing what you donâ€™t want exposed. I wore a plunging neckline and it kept the dress falling where it needed to. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> A friend gave me one of these tapes when she saw that my shirt was stretching open between the buttons.  These are super sticky and work great, glad she recommended them to me!</li>
            <li> The tape is great for keeping necklines where they should be and to keep bra straps from showing.  It never fails!</li>
            <li> I love this product, I&#x27;m using it right now.  I used to have to carefully place safety pins on my tops so they don&#x27;t gape but this stuff works much better.  I use it on button down shirts as well as criss-cross shirts so they don&#x27;t dip so low.</li>
            <li> I bought the exact same one from somewhere else (slightly more expensive but Prime eligible).  It&#x27;s strong enough to hold the clothing in place but easy enough to peel off.  It&#x27;s also great to hold my over-the-knee boots in place (for more than 7 hours, but in cool weather).  So far it works great! I love the tin box design. I&#x27;ll always keep it in my cosmetics bag.</li>
            <li> This fashion tape is awesome.  I am big busted and many times my tops don&#x27;t fit right, never again do I have to worry about gaping holes.  Sweaters that pull away just a little and show your bra strap are no more.  Shirts that won&#x27;t stay in place..all gone.  This stuff is great.  Stays put too.</li>
            <li> This tape is great.  I use it frequently for the gaping that happens in the chest area.  I knocked a star off because doesn&#x27;t always last the whole day.  I sometimes find that I need to replace it mid-day.  Still, it&#x27;s by far the best solution I&#x27;ve found for the problem.</li>
            <li> Fashion tape works well for a quick hem, but I&#x27;ve never been able to use it successfully for anything else.  Within a few hours or less, the tape wears out if used to hold material together, e.g., to &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; a too low cut neckline.  I do not recommend relying on double sided tape, or the original, for any critical temporary fixes.</li>
            <li> Works great!! Even when you&#x27;re sweating!</li>
            <li> Great product - but shipping price doesn&#x27;t compete with inshore purchases.</li>
            <li> THESE WORK AMAZING!!!!</li>
            <li> Works great. I use it to secure clothing to itself (button down shirts, etc.) or to keep my bras&#x27; shoulder straps from showing in wide necked shirts (tack the tape on the outside of the bra strap and stick the shirt&#x27;s neck edging to the tape). Works great in an emergency when you lost a botton or when your hem decides to fall. I usually only wear cotton-type materials, so I can only vouch for that material.  Wish I&#x27;d known about this type of produce YEARS ago. I do use shorter pieces than its pre-cut length, so I cut them in half with a pair of scizzors. The tin (read: sturdy) container is also great, as it&#x27;s about the size of a lipstick, so it tucks nicely in my purse - even a small clutch type.  You could even take a piece and tuck it into a wallet or something small, like that. Now my &amp;#34;emergency&amp;#34; pocket in my purse and wallet contains a couple bandaids and a couple of these tapes!) Every lady needs these!</li>
            <li> This is a great idea in theory, but I didn&#x27;t find that this worked as well as other reviewers. Maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong. When it was too hot and I got sweaty everything started to come apart. I would rather have a long roll of tape instead of these little strips. Probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Omg, this stuff is amazing.  As a woman of generous chest,  I can&#x27;t often wear button-down shirts, as if they are big enough on top they are ginormous elsewhere and look horrendous.  Problem solved with this tape!  How have I never discovered this before?</li>
            <li> great tape. but sometimes it does stay as it should ... if you use make sure you take a few with you when you go out just in case it loosens .</li>
            <li> This tape works great.  I used it to tape together an opening in one of my tops which was too immodest.  It works perfectly!  Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t work, don&#x27;t stick, were useless</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly! Lasted all day!</li>
            <li> Bring extra when you&#x27;re helping a bride get ready or going to a fancy event!</li>
            <li> This tape was very disappointing as it did not work for what I anticipated. It has poor adhesive qualities and did to stick my my skin or fabric where needed. I would not recommend this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed this tape to secures breast for a wedding and this product was an epic fail in that department...good old safety pin came to the rescue.</li>
            <li> sticks to clothes and have to use goo gone to get off</li>
            <li> Held my strapless prom dress up perfectly!!! It was really easy to apply and take off and wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable to wear</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t leave for nights out without this holding up my bra or dress or whatever I need.  Cute packaging, easy application and removal.</li>
            <li> I use this tape all the time for a variety of things - to close the gap between buttons on shirts, to tape clothing to skin and bras. I keep it in my purse all the time - the tin the tape comes in is a perfect small size to carry in a purse.</li>
            <li> So handy with many uses - hems, cleavage cover, shirt gaps, bra strap alignment. No residue left on clothes and does not hurt skin. You will need to reapply if you&#x27;re sweaty/out in humidity.</li>
            <li> Works well, but sags at the end of the day or if I am extra sweaty.</li>
            <li> Awesome even better then I could have imagined. It&#x27;s super sticky and nothing will move from where you place it. So worth it</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work very well for me.</li>
            <li> Did not keep up my dress AT ALL. I was adjusting myself the whole night, even changed the tape again during the night but didn&#x27;t do anything. Absolutely useless. Now I have two cases of these and I don&#x27;t know what to do with it. Come to think of it, I ran out of office tape, I&#x27;ll use it for that!</li>
            <li> I have the hardest time wearing button down shirts.  I always have that &amp;#34;gap&amp;#34; right at my bust line.  These amazing little things have opened up a whole new wardrobe for me!</li>
            <li> The product worked really well and kept my clothesâ€‹ in place.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Cannot live without this stuff. Takes care of clothes emergencies!</li>
            <li> This is good tape and worth the money it will hold your bra straps in place and it does hold your dress in place if you choose to wear a plunging dress it is what the stars use so the photographers don&#x27;t get a shot of there breasts. I rated this high and would recommend it but just an FYI you can buy something similar to this at Walmart in the bra department over were the strapless bras and invisible bras are most of the &amp;#34;associates&amp;#34; don&#x27;t know its there but if you look hard enough it is there. It comes in a regular tape dispenser so you can choose any length you want this tape Hollywood Fashion Tape is a pre cut length of 2&amp;#34; but does come in a handy tin to throw in your purse in case you need to make adjustments thru the night. Another FYI I have seen the other Hollywood products in Walmart over were they sell the Sally Hanson stuff in the make up department. But this is worth the money and its delivered to your door.</li>
            <li> Tried these on with a formal cocktail dress that is just way too low and these are perfect! Watched a YouTube video on how to apply. Will carry some extras in my purse.</li>
            <li> This tape is amazing for the shirt that just doesn&#x27;t close comfortably in the front. Keeps the buttons and seams all neat and clean and lying flat. I cut each piece in half as that&#x27;s all that&#x27;s needed and so one box lasts and lasts. The tape is easy to remove.</li>
            <li> I love these things.  I can never seem to have enough of them.  They work really well.  I recommend them.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! Keeps clothing wear it needs to be without budging, you can pull it off &amp; restick it several times no problem, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all to pull. Awesome product that I will keep buying for sure!</li>
            <li> Maybe my fabric was too heavy, but it felt like I needed much heavier tape to keep strapless dress anchored. might be good for placing straps.</li>
            <li> I have been looking everywhere for tape like this, I should have known to go straight to Amazon! I can finally throw away the safety pins!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this item for times when my clothes do not hang the way I want for me or my teenager. I kept a tin and gave the other one to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;-Tin is pretty and small enough to throw in a hand bag&lt;br /&gt;-The tin does not pop open unexspectantly during transport but is easy to open when you want to grab a strip&lt;br /&gt;-The strips are protected enough that you can through a few in your wallet or pocket and leave the tin at home&lt;br /&gt;-Tape is easy to apply and stays put&lt;br /&gt;-When ready to remove, the tape comes off without damaging clothing or bruising skin&lt;br /&gt;-Each strip is long enough to cut in half for smaller jobs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-If you want to use half of a strip, it is better to cut it as oppose to tearing off a piece. Not a problem at home, but a little more difficult on the go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pat</li>
            <li> I have used Maidenform&#x27;s fabric tape and it is horrible. It has actually ruined 3 articles of clothing because the tape did not come off.  This product works great! It stays put on your skin and keeps the fabric where is belong.  It comes off easily leaving no residue behind. Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> A friend told me about these strips; I never knew such an item exist.  They work just as good on skin as on cloth. I am so glad Amazon has such neat items such as this.</li>
            <li> I should have gotten these earlier.  Perfect for keeping straps in place.</li>
            <li> I used these to hold together 5 long window panels instead of sewing them together and they worked fabulously. I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Great stuff - everyone - man or woman needs to have this on hand.</li>
            <li> These are great - kept everything in place as a wedding guest in a strapless dress!</li>
            <li> Item did as it should. Great for button hole gaps in blouses. Does not perform well on very smooth fabrics.</li>
            <li> This tape is amazing!  Use it to keep your bra straps from showing on a top, or use them to keep your assets from popping out in a costume.  I highly recommend this tape!</li>
            <li> This fashion tape is pretty thin which makes it easier in the skin.  It attaches easily and stays in place.  Can be used for skin-to-fabric or fabric-to-fabric.  I often use it to hold some fashion tops, using this tape on my bra strap to hold the fabric in place.</li>
            <li> Works amazingly well. I LOVE this product!!</li>
            <li> This is the best double stick tape, they perfected the process to affix it too.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t hold dress to well had to use more than one and change out durning the night.</li>
            <li> There is not one bad thing I can say about these - except maybe that it SUCKS that I didn&#x27;t discover these until my forties! The number of fashion disasters I could have avoided in my life is simply mind-boggling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These thin strips are easy to use, discreet, and they WORK! The backing tape is cut conveniently to get the backings off easily. Clothes stick well to other clothes, to bra straps, to skin, etc - and yet when it&#x27;s time to pull them off, they come off neatly with no residue. I&#x27;ve used them to keep cleavage from getting too out of hand, to make sure my wrap doesn&#x27;t fall back and expose my armpits when I&#x27;m wearing a sleeveless top, and to make sure my bra straps don&#x27;t show. They&#x27;re fabulous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little boxes they come in are cute, almost like an altoids tin that you&#x27;ll want to re-use, and small enough to fit in a purse. I absolutely LOVE this purchase, and never want to be without these things again!</li>
            <li> These strips work great. Once they are on, whatever is attached to them does not move at all. I will continue to purchase these.</li>
            <li> Its double sided tape, works for what i need it for!</li>
            <li> This tape does exactly what I hoped.  It secures all fabrics to make necklines more modest and to keep wrap dresses anchored so that there are no embarrassing moments.</li>
            <li> I think these strips are amazing. I have not read all of the reviews but I use them for a different reason so maybe this will give you another use. I have a difficult time keeping a high heel or a sling back shoe on my foot as my heel slips to one side. So I take the strip and put it in the shoe and voila my foot stays in place for the day. I feel very comfortable that I am not going to twist my ankle or my heel will slide out. My foot just stays in place. You have to give the shoe a bit if a tug when you take it off as there is good sticking power, but you can get three to four wears from one strip. Not a good idea to wear when you are going shopping or if you need to take your shoes off during the day.</li>
            <li> Granddaughter  used it at prom  no issues</li>
            <li> This tape works well in keeping the fabrics together. I&#x27;ve used it for formal dresses as well as button up shirts for everyday wear. The tape is sticky enough to keep the fabrics together but not to the point of ruining the fabric. I like to cut the strips into smaller pieces to fit my needs because I find that I don&#x27;t need the whole strip. The whole tin lasted me for a whole year before. Strongly recommend!</li>
            <li> Not what I expected based on reviews. It&#x27;s just cheap double stick tape.</li>
            <li> This tape does not stick to materials nor the skin well enough to feel secure that the clothing will stay in place. I not only recommend this particular Hollywood Fashion Tape, think they should remove it from the market.</li>
            <li> Excellent for hiding bra straps and solving other wardrobe malfunction issues.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a godsend. I&#x27;ve been using it for years- keeps revealing tops securely in place.</li>
            <li> Nope, did not like them !! They did not seem to stick to the fabric but REALLY did stick to me. Yuck !!</li>
            <li> ITS OK FOR THE PRICE, THE TAPE DOSENT LAST VERY LONG, AND YOU CAN SEE THE TAPE THROUGH SOME CLOTHING.</li>
            <li> I found it very hard to use and gave up.  Maybe need some more practice but if you struggle at all with tape, try something different.  It stuck to fingers well but not to material.</li>
            <li> Purchased Many times. Works great for button up blouses (what I use it for).</li>
            <li> Very great! Has just enough stick to last all day</li>
            <li> Worked great! I used these as part of the mini gift bags for a group of bridesmaids and they all loved them. I&#x27;ve used this on several occasions now and am very pleased! Fits in your purse, strong tape for almost any malfunction. Almost replaces bobby pins!</li>
            <li> Great product, quick service!!</li>
            <li> So-so, they are good for one time use only if you don&#x27;t sweat, if you wear this with a romper and need to go to the bathroom... Bring extra! And if your going to sweat or be outside in the heat... Bring extra!</li>
            <li> It held its place. After two hours started to gome off. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I put this on my daughter&#x27;s dress for her for a dance. It came loose in one major area before she even left the house. Maybe the side that touches skin should have stronger adhesive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m small and large chested, and these actually keep my shirts closed. Its also handy when you need to hem a skirt or pants in a bind.</li>
            <li> Not sure what I did before I found fashion tape!  Yes, I do - I kept pulling my blouse so my bra wasn&#x27;t showing! On the down side - it can be a bit of work to remove the tape from your clothes but it does come off.  Still, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an avid salsa dancer at a local club and was looking for some way to keep up a cute red strapless dress so I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about it falling while I was dancing. There isn&#x27;t much time to really...\\&quot;correct\\&quot; your dress while dancing without looking awkward, so I needed something that would really do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked around at various ways to keep something in check, from pinning the dress to a bra (which wouldn&#x27;t really help in my case), to other random fixes. When I found these, there seemed to be nothing but praise for them, so I decided to give it a shot. And I am incredibly happy I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tape itself came right on time, and I decided to take it for a test drive the next time I went dancing. I put the tape on the inside of my bra around the strap itself and in the cup to make sure that stayed in place, and then put multiple tape pieces between the bra and dress and a few directly on my skin. Let me just describe this outfit for you. A push-up strapless bra (that usually falls regardless) with a tight red knit strapless dress with just a line of rubber along the top to keep it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coupled with this tape, however, 5 and a half hours of salsa dancing later, this dress was still up. Granted, I tugged at it a little a few times out of my own paranoia, but this definitely changed my night from being uncomfortable and awkward, to making me feel a lot more confident and being able to let loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking the tape off was hardly painful skin-wise. Sort of like taking off a bandaid, but not even that bad. I think it probably had to do with the fact that I was sweating with it and had worn it for so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you couldn&#x27;t tell, I&#x27;m incredibly pleased with this product, and I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering it again. It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This product is very hard to find in my area, so I ordered it from Amazon.  It is a lifesaver sometimes, and provides comfort in knowing something isn&#x27;t going to come open or cause a &amp;#34;fashion emergency&amp;#34;, especially at a big event.</li>
            <li> I purchased this fashion tape actually for my daughter to use with her strapless dress for an 8th grade semi-formal dance. The dress is a size 2 and my daughter would have been mortified if a \\&quot;wardrobe malfunction\\&quot; occurred, so I figured this tape would do the trick. We made sure that we followed the directions but the tape did not hold for longer than an hour or so. Thankfully her dress stayed up, but the tape failed. Then I figured that I would use it with some of my strapless sundresses, and it still failed to hold for longer than a half hour or so. I would not recommend this product to anyone hoping to have it last an entire evening.</li>
            <li> Works great. Holds amazingly well and lasts all day long. i had low expectations but it&#x27;s super sticky and does not come off unless you purposefully take it off. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really stick to fabric well.</li>
            <li> Had a strapless dress that would always slide down. Tried this before it went in the give away pile.&lt;br /&gt;It worked great!  Held the dress up,and was easy to apply and remove.</li>
            <li> This worked better than other clothing tape I have tried and I really like it. Just like with other tape, however, once you apply it to your clothing, you can&#x27;t really readjust it. It&#x27;s only sticky once so you have to make sure you put it where you want it. Not a big deal, especially since a single tin is packed with more than I&#x27;ll probably use in several years.</li>
            <li> I have two light weight blouses that crisscross in the front. Everything is okay unless I bend over to pick something up, and then the blouse opens. Usually I use a small safety pin to pin it to my bra in the middle, but then the blouse doesn&#x27;t move when I do. Used these little strips of tape and they keep the blouse shut. I can use the tape on my skin above and to the side to hold the blouse where it doesn&#x27;t move much anyway. Also tape it farther down on the edge against my skin. No longer does anything show when I bend.</li>
            <li> These are great and portable for travel.  Does the job and never ruins any fabric.  It is always in my purse.</li>
            <li> Tape is great! Hold well and does not leave any sticky residue on clothing.</li>
            <li> I had a military ball last night and had a strapless dress that needed tape to stay to my body. I decided to buy these and let me tell you they were great. They stayed on me all night and they were not hard at all to put on. The shipping was also very fast which I was happy about. I really recommend this product, I was a little afraid that they were not going to stay all night, but they actually did. The only advice I would give is to make sure you wipe the area where you are planning to put the tape strips and do not put any body lotion on that area and it should work.</li>
            <li> Works very well. I can place it under a garment, right on top of my shoulder or between 2 garments ( like a tank top and cardigan), with the sticky surface on top of or underneath the pad...whichever works best.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how much I adore Hollywood Fashion Tape. I&#x27;m one of those women who often has a gap in button down shirts, and this seals it right up - and strong, too! I can&#x27;t recommend this enough for those finishing touches with clothes. (I&#x27;d recommend removing it before you wash, though!)</li>
            <li> Great product, I love it. I use it in some of my outfits, and for costumes and couldn&#x27;t ask for a better helper- other than magic.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this to keep my shirt flat - the fabric between the buttons popped out. This tape worked like a charm! I also use it to hem my pants to adjust for different shoes.</li>
            <li> I used this twice only. Since I live in Fl , I sweat most of the time, so when the tape gets wet the adhesive won&#x27;t work anymore.</li>
            <li> Having trouble finding something like this locally. Works as it should and easy to use. I would say only con is sometimes its too sticky.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Always keep it in my purse for an emergency waldrobe malfunction. Was a bridesmaid in a wedding, and it came really in handy for all of the bridesmaids. Keeps those bra straps in place! Case is sleek and small, making it easy to fit into any small clutch bag.</li>
            <li> I have a rather large chest, so I regularly use these kinds of products to secure various bits of clothing. This brand is strong but easily removed after use. I love how easy it is to peel the tape off the paper, since many brands make it almost impossible. They are easy to shove in your purse. I always keep a dozen in my car. I&#x27;ve even surreptitiously slipped one to my friend at a dance when her dress strap kept falling! Effective on both bare skin and clothing.&lt;br /&gt;Good product, and the best brand.</li>
            <li> So much better than the tape dispenser options that are out there.  I used it for a low cut dress and also for a work shirt and it held up in both scenarios.</li>
            <li> I bought these to try on two of my favorite tops that have neckline hems that come out.  They are a little hard to handle.  I ruined a couple trying to get the first one on.  I succeeded and it seems to work well on the first top that has thicker material.  On the second top, the material is flimsier and the strip bunches the material somewhat.  They look like a  narrow piece of double-sided scotch tape.  I wonder if they would be strong enough to work on pant leg hems.  The jury is still out on their effectiveness.  If you want to try these, this is a good price.  I saw them in a store for one package at about the same price.  This purchase gives you two packages.  My manual dexterity is not great which is why I don&#x27;t just sew things.  I thought these would be a miracle solution---not so much.</li>
            <li> Does the job, keeps clothing where you want it to stay.  I have sensitive skin so I was afraid it would irritate my skin, but it didn&#x27;t, so I&#x27;m pleased with that.  Also used these strips in tropical settings, was worried that sweating would impair stickiness/staying power, but that was not an issue.  Final potential concern was that it would damage fine fabrics.  I&#x27;ve used these strips on fine silk without issues.  I prefer this to the roll-tape version because that one left tape exposed to the elements and it would always either dry out or attract dust (and become non-sticky).  Also, the tape version has &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; to be cause to cut the tape, and it would get caught on things in my luggage.  This packaging is small enough to stick in even a small purse, in case of emergency.</li>
            <li> Item received in a timely matter.</li>
            <li> Got this for a She-Ra costume and it worked wonders. I used it to tape my costume to my skin to hold it up in a few places so I wouldn&#x27;t be tugging at my outfit all night, and it totally did the job.  I didn&#x27;t have to fidget with my costume at all and everything stayed in place.</li>
            <li> Totally work for preventing wardrobe malfunctions or making a slight adjustment before going on.  I use them all the time...</li>
            <li> They work and do what they are supposed to do !!!&lt;br /&gt;Cute casing too.&lt;br /&gt;I use them as double sided tapes for general use too ! Oops :)</li>
            <li> love this stuff, dont like all my straps showing, thats for my daughter . so glad to find it on amazon</li>
            <li> I had to buy a long dress for a particular occasion and the fit was such that I was just sure I couldn&#x27;t keep the strap up on my own. Hollywood Fashion Secrets tape to the rescue!  It went on easily, stuck to both the dress and my skin perfectly for as long as I needed it, then removed easily as well with no sticky residue.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be using this again in the future - love it!</li>
            <li> They did not hold my dress to me for more than a few seconds, if that !!</li>
            <li> this is a great thing to have on hand but it doesnt work for all materials in my opinion.  This was worth buying but it didnt work on all my clothes.</li>
            <li> Use these al the time, even on skin. I love these.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping. I am satisfied with this purchase. This fashion strips does a good jobðŸ˜€</li>
            <li> Bra straps falling down? Bit of an awkward gap in the shirt? Unraveling hem at a business meeting? If you&#x27;ve got a wardrobe malfunction like these, you need to have a  handy little packet of Hollywood Fashion Tape in your purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how I lived without this for so long. My bra straps had constantly made their way off my shoulders most of my bra-wearing life. No more! Easy to apply, easy to come off* these strips are lifesavers. They are inexpensive and very purse-tuckable. I have one tin at home and one in my bag so I&#x27;m never without the fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*It&#x27;s hot here in Georgia so sometimes at the end of the day peeling the tape off my shoulder is a bit ouchy. I&#x27;m sure I can remedy that with some lotion maybe. Still, a little sting is worth a whole day of not worrying about the bra strap slide.</li>
            <li> Bought these mainly for some of my shirts that seem to get the opening in the front when wearing. Tried it on one of my blouses last week and totally kept it closed. Up until now I had been using safety pins and we all know how hard sometimes they are to getting it not to show. Love these!</li>
            <li> I use this for bra straps and hemming slavks. Has not let me down yet. Doesn&#x27;t harm delicate fabric and has no residue. Little tins can be reused for other things. Great for beads.</li>
            <li> I really love the silky blouses trend right now.  I bought at least 5 from local ZARA store.  They are so feminine and at the same time appropriate for work and party time. However what I don&#x27;t enjoy is how easy they can slip off your shoulders or buttons get undone. That&#x27;s when I remembered that I have this amazing fashion tape. Now I feel very safe knowing that everything stays where it suppose to and there will be no embarrassing slippages. Honestly this tape is a life saver. It works awesome no matter how you decide to use it, on your bare skin or just to stick two pieces of material. It never leaves sticky residue or anything like that. It also never ever caused any kind of damage or irritation to my skin. I know the price is steep and double sided scotch tape seems like a better idea.  However, it will never work as well as Hollywood tape. 100% recommend for all women out there!</li>
            <li> This is the best brand of fashion tape I have used.  The other brand I tried did not stick my clothes in place as well and also left a nasty sticky residue on both my skin and my clothes.  Hollywood tape does not do this.  It sticks well and peels off skin and clothes without leaving residue.  Great product!</li>
            <li> These are the best holding tape strips I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I love the product. It was delivered quickly and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> sticks great to skin and even polyester/slick fabrics</li>
            <li> This tape is great for keeping blouses from gapping open between the buttons.  It sticks really well, is invisible, but comes off of clothes easily when you&#x27;re finished wearing them, and leaves no adhesive residue.</li>
            <li> I used these for to keep a plunging neckline in place and they worked great.</li>
            <li> This keeps my bra straps perfectly in place and hidden when wearing boatnecks. Just be careful as I removed it from my skin too quickly one time and pulled my skin off too.</li>
            <li> Look into other brands for better quality options at relatively the same price.  It is not very strong on fabric, I really have not tried it on skin.</li>
            <li> I love button down shirts, but they don&#x27;t love me or my bust. Having that gap at the bust in between the buttons really ruins an outfit and makes you look as if you don&#x27;t know how to dress yourself. Thanks to this tape, I no longer have this problem. I can move freely and confidently without having to look down all the time and adjust my shirt. No more looking sloppy and disheveled when the look I&#x27;m going for is crisp and tailored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to try it with all my drapey tees that slip off my shoulder and reveal The Unsightly Bra Strap for all to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A must-try for anyone with the above-mentioned issues. I also like the idea of using it to adjust pants hems for different shoes. Brilliant! Five stars all the way!</li>
            <li> Great product, works well, there are plenty of them in an attractive functional case... what more can I ask for?</li>
            <li> It works fine, but with arthritic hands hard to manage.  I do keep tin in handbag just in case.  For the average person it would  be great.</li>
            <li> This works great with some fabrics and not so well with others. I recently hemmed a few pants, a coat and kept camisoles in place, with this tape.  I can&#x27;t say which fabrics it works best on because I have two pair of pants made of the same fabric, the pair more heavenly worn (therefore washed more) the tape more easily adheres. The pants were 64% polyester, 32% Rayon, and 4% Spandex. The coat is wool.  Sometimes it works well and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t.  Apply to clean oil less skin if applying to skin.</li>
            <li> These are amazing! I used them on a strapless top and they worked all day long. No more pulling up the shirt every few minutes. Perfect product. I will never again use anything else!</li>
            <li> The tape held fast, so it did the job. However, the tape had irritated two spots on the tops of my breasts, to the point of opening sores. I do not appreciate this in the least.</li>
            <li> I have used Topstitch toupee tape for years for garment control (such as: keeping bra straps from falling off my shoulders, pasting shirt to bra or skin to lift neckline in order to prevent showing cleavage at work, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Hollywood tape sticks just as well as Topstitch and I do like it.  However, it is more difficult to remove the backing , so it takes me more time to apply the Hollywood tape.  Also, Topstitch comes in nice 1&amp;#34; width strips, which i prefer to the 1/2&amp;#34; Hollywood tape.  At this time i&#x27;m using this tape mostly to keep my cleavage from showing when i&#x27;m at work, so the 1&amp;#34; width works better for me.</li>
            <li> I ordered these before from another vender.  These are the best things for someone who is small in the shoulders and the top of your shirt keeps moving down.  Tapes keep clothing in place and remove easily when done!</li>
            <li> Used these on a very low cut dress I wore for a Halloween party and they lasted all night. Very durable and I wasn&#x27;t worried about having any accidents.</li>
            <li> Best kept secret EVER!</li>
            <li> Daughter and dances- a must have!</li>
            <li> Cant live without this stuff</li>
            <li> Works well but wish I had purchased dots instead.  Tried to cut strips in half but had hard time not touching adhesive part prior to applying to skin and fabric.  Would definitely order product again but not strips.</li>
            <li> These work well but I found that my skin got red after moving it to adjust. BUT I have VERY sensitive skin and almost everything does that. It wasn&#x27;t a long lasting effect (gone in 30 min)  or a deal breaker for future use. Does what it says, shipped fast. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I had a red strapless dress I wanted to wear to a summer wedding, but I didn&#x27;t have any fashion tape. The dress coupled with my strapless adhesive silicone bra was a no go, slipped immediately. So I did not end up wearing the red strapless dress. Fast forward to the next wedding, and I had invested in these pre-cut strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe I used 10+ strips around the bust of my red strapless dress, and I did not have to worry for the next 12 hours. The fashion tape definitely gets the job done just make sure you&#x27;re thorough. One or two strips will not hold a top or dress up. I would recommend placing the fashion tape on clean skin, free of lotion, right after the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It adhered to my dress and skin for the full 12 hours of moving, celebrating, and LOTS of dancing. Even when I jumped up and down to the music, I looked down and was incredibly thankful that my dress stayed in place!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  Keeps buttoned blouses closed and prevents my bra strap from showing with so many of my shirts.  Don&#x27;t forget to take it off your clothes or bra before you launder them.</li>
            <li> I have pretty mixed feelings about this tape but the quick version of this review is that it&#x27;s very useful, makes a great stocking stuffer, is a handy tool to have in one&#x27;s purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the long version, the first time I used it was at a sorority event and all the ladies gathered around me to take some. It helped keep a strapless dress in place, assisted in not having any side boobs pop out and also kept a bra up. Although I admit it does irritate the skin and mine was left pretty red and sore afterwards. While this product is pretty strong, the material of the fabric you are sticking it to has a lot to do with how well this product will adhere; ie. don&#x27;t use it on anything fuzzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would say it&#x27;s a nifty little tool that has more uses than simply helping a strapless bra stay in place. It was worth it and much cheaper to get it off amazon than anywhere else.</li>
            <li> It works.  After I wear it..I have to kinda thumb it off....working it off like that glue they use on some sample cards..you rub it until balls up like goo and it picks off.  So it&#x27;s one time stuff...but it sticks on my lacey bra straps....I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I use these as a quick fix for hems.  It&#x27;s excellent - I have not tried on denim or any thick material.  I also used it to keep a bridesmaid dress which was slightly to large in the top in place. Works well.</li>
            <li> I have used these to hold up bra straps when I go dancing for about 3 years.  They work great!!!  Excellent price through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I bought this tape to help hold up a strapless dress. It worked ok but hurt when I tried to take it off my body. It also took some of the fabric from the dress with it!</li>
            <li> Did not work very well for me. It was too thin and not sticky enough for the material of a bridesmaid dress.</li>
            <li> works just as promised.  no more tugging at straps falling down my arms or peek-a-boo with my blouses.</li>
            <li> I have not had a chance to use this produce but it came quickly and I look forward to having it when I need it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use - double sided clear tape.&lt;br /&gt;The adhesive doesn&#x27;t itch (I have sensitive skin) and sticks well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it to secure a particularly annoying top that gapes a little at the chest. I cut the (7.5cm long) strip into two and taped both sides to my chest. Voila! It works without any show- unlike what a &amp;#34;stiff&amp;#34; safety pin holding things together would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, worth the price if you want to be sure you can&#x27;t afford a wardrobe malfunction.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  I had tried a fashion emergency kit that had this in it and was re-ordering b/c I used it so much! It&#x27;s easy to apply, holds great, doesn&#x27;t damage clothes, and easy to take off. I use it to keep bra straps in place, shirts on shoulders,even a quick hem on a borrowed clothing item.</li>
            <li> The tape holds very well! Definitely better than I expected and for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it! I wore it to hold some flaps in on a dress and even after dancing for hours, the tape still held them in place.</li>
            <li> These are the greatest thing ever!! I&#x27;ve always used fashion tape but in the roll. But I seem to have trouble with the rolls quite a bit as they don&#x27;t always tear smoothly and you end up wasting more than you want to. This is so convenient. I keep one in my room and the other in my purse. The pre-cut strips are perfect size and I love the little tins that they&#x27;re stored in. When these run out I will definitely be ordering them again.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves them, we bought thm for her. She loves to put them When she is using her night or prom dresses. Thank you</li>
            <li> I purchased the tape to hold a very low cut dress in place. The tape doesn&#x27;t stick to skin. Sticks cloth to cloth well but if you are getting it so that you can hold a dress or shirt in place, it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It really works I really recommend it</li>
            <li> Mostly useless since it&#x27;s hard to apply. I had to go through several pieces before getting one to stick to the fabric and not my finger. It stayed for a few hours.</li>
            <li> Necessary for many dresses!</li>
            <li> Hollywood fashion tape is terrific.  I use in to hold my low cut tops in place and also to do a quick repair of a hem if I&#x27;m in a hurry and don&#x27;t have time to sew.</li>
            <li> We used these for my daughters prom as her dress was strapless and it gave her a good sense of security that the dress would stay in place. She said that they were easily removed from her skin as well. They served the purpose!</li>
            <li> I have used other products but this is the best.  I use it on clothes and it doesn&#x27;t damage the fabrics even the mos delicate.  It stays until I take it off.  I have total confidence in this tape always.</li>
            <li> I use this on button-down shirts - to close gaps. It lasts all day! I highly recommend having this stuff around for lots of &#x27;fashion emergencies&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this tape in a roll to keep my top and dress necklines in place. I purchased this item because it came already cut into strips in a container which will be great for traveling. I find it more convenient because I don&#x27;t always travel with a pair of scissors. Also it&#x27;s easier to separate the backing from the tape due to there being a small edge of backing all around.</li>
            <li> I use this product almost everyday to hold something in place.  I cut it to the size I need so it last a long time.  I haven&#x27;t tried in on skin so I&#x27;m not sure how it would hold for that purpose.  I use it to keep blouses from gaping around the bust and to keep necklines where I want them.  Won&#x27;t be without it.  Great purchase for me.</li>
            <li> easy to use once you get the hang of it</li>
            <li> If your big  busted (upper end of B or more) you need to use a lot of strips and pray. Would like a wider strip for my size.</li>
            <li> This tape always helps out in a pinch. I&#x27;ve used it for fashion emergencies as well as craft projects! It sticks well and lasts all day. It does say not to wear for longer than a certain amount of hours or it will cause irritation. This I found to be true. I wore it 8+ hours and I started to itch and burn a bit. I took the tape off and it was very red there for the next two days. Overall I love love the tape and take it in my purse everywhere I go.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness for double-sided tape!  It kept my dress perfectly in place on my wedding day, when it otherwise was slipping and messy looking.  It kept its stick all day, even after a hot summer day.</li>
            <li> Use this product every time I dress.  They straps on anything are securely in place for the day and make me more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Great product for holding your shirt together at the bust line.  I have also used it to hem pants when I don&#x27;t have time to get the needle and thread.  Does just what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it works ok, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t. Overall I am not impressed. It does not work as well as I was hoping it would and therefore I would not recommend this product and will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> This tape works better for some fabric types over others. So, be careful experimenting, as you may find yourself showing not only gaps in a shirt but also some strange looking tape! Thin smooth cotton shirts are fine. However, anything softly woven doesn&#x27;t hold together long, as the tape eventually takes off some fuzz and pulls away. It also doesn&#x27;t work with heavier-weight polyester.</li>
            <li> Ok, I have larger breasts.. good for some shirts not soo good for button down shirts.. lol... I hate it when I see women who have a button down shirt on and there is a gap in her shirt at the bust...I use this take ALL the time. My shirts fit fine (no a size too small) but there is always a gap when you move... I think using this tape creates a more polished/classy look...... I will ALWAYS use this fashion tape!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  And these are so convenient for traveling and my purse.  I use it for button up shirts and low cut tops.  My husband use it with his ties.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews prior to purchasing these. I was misled. They are really quite useless.</li>
            <li> Love Hollywood Tape! The precut strips are easier to use than another brand&#x27;s continuous tape. Great for avoiding wardrobe malfunctions!</li>
            <li> hard to get to stick on both sides -very sticky, but doesn&#x27;t always hold on fabric, was disappointed that it didn&#x27;t hold blouse closed</li>
            <li> These really work, they keep any blouses I have that fall open secure and in place.</li>
            <li> This tape works great for keeping my shirt from slipping on my shoulders or my bra being exposed.  It lasts the entire work day.</li>
            <li> They do work, they stick to the skin and the clothes. But one thing I dont like about it, is.. It is too sticky, after u have it in for the whole day, its abit too sticky, and u need to be careful when u remove it, because it may cause redness to ur skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. Not only does it work with clothing but it has lots of other uses as well.</li>
            <li> This fashion tape saved the day for me. No matter what bra I tried, I could not find one that worked perfectly with my low cut dress. Finally, I used this tape to get my dress taped down and it stayed secure the entire time - I am so glad I ordered it!</li>
            <li> works like a charm! now my shirt nv pops!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used fashion tape before &amp; was fine. This was a fail. It didn&#x27;t hold anything in place &amp; ended up rolling or getting g partially loose &amp; getting stuck to itself. I wanted it for a dress so I had an extra insurance policy that nothing would accidentally be seen... Luckily I was good but I briefly looked like I lost a fight with an office tape dispenser.</li>
            <li> I used these strips to keep a strapless dress in place when I was a bridesmaid in a wedding. They worked great throughout the ceremony, but after an hour of taking photos outside they were definitely starting to lose their stick to my skin. After a couple more hours of (hot, sweaty) dancing, they had rolled themselves into little balls that stuck to the inside of my dress and felt kind of scratchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I still give 4 stars because they stuck much better than I thought they would through the midwest August heat. I&#x27;m glad the pack came with a lot, as I&#x27;ve got a few blouses that gap between the buttons and I think these are going to do just the trick. And they do work great if you&#x27;re in a situation where you&#x27;re not intensely sweating.</li>
            <li> Best double stick fashion tape on the market. It&#x27;s not perfect on everything, but what is?!! I HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love! I wore I completely low cut revealing too, and never once felt insecure. I fell and was kicked out of a club in Vegas, but my boobs never fell out!!!</li>
            <li> These are okay if you only need to wear them for a short amount of time. They don&#x27;t hold up very long. I have large breasts, so the result may be different for someone with smaller breasts.</li>
            <li> Who knew?  I love them and shared them with my lady friends at work.  Yes - I recommend this for every woman.</li>
            <li> I use fashion tape at least once a week to secure my layers for work outfits.  Never have a bra strap or cleavage mishap!  I love the strips over the rolls b/c they are easier to manage BUT one size is restrictive.  A few sizes and I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Has been great for keeping dresses and blouses appropriate for those of us who are larger busted.  I keep extra strips in my purse for in case of emergencies.</li>
            <li> I use it every weekend and I love it!</li>
            <li> They do what they say they will ;)</li>
            <li> Hollywood fashion tape worked perfectly at prom which is surprising because I was moving and dancing a lot, however; I went to a family dinner where all I did was sit at the table and it didn&#x27;t work. I don&#x27;t know if it was operator error or it was because the second dress was made of a different material, but it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> We use this to keep our toddlers hearing aids secured. Works wonderful, doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin. Stays on in humidity and sweaty conditions. Better than anything else we have tried.</li>
            <li> The Hollywood Fashion Tape, This stuff really works great!  Does not harm clothing and removes easily.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I work in a very professional setting and some of my dress shirts don&#x27;t always cooperate.  These strips are sticky enough to hold any shirt in place and are easy to get off without too much tugging or pain.  I now have one tin at home and one tin in my purse!</li>
            <li> I was just hoping for something that would make it so I wouldn&#x27;t be readjusting my shirt every 5 minutes, but this stuff went above and beyond! My first use, an entire day of walking through the city, moving up and down and all about, and my shirt stayed perfectly in place. Not once did I look down and see my bra peeking out where it shouldn&#x27;t. Will be buying again!</li>
            <li> I love this tape, I&#x27;m never without it...</li>
            <li> Works great and keeps a good hold between the fabric and my skin!</li>
            <li> Theses are great for a variety of applications.  I even used them to keep my ear bud covers from popping off - I almost lost them in an airport.  I use them to keep clothing covering bra straps and cups so my bra doesn&#x27;t show.  Could also be used in a pinch for I partially unsewn hem.</li>
            <li> Lifesaver for Mardi Gras ball gown!</li>
            <li> After reading all the great reviews on this product i was sure is was going to be a god sent! worst mistake ever not easy to use, doesn&#x27;t hold on to any type of clothing. if you wear low cut shirts or mini dresses keep looking for something else cause this does not work the minute you move it comes off!</li>
            <li> I cut these strips in half since most of my blouse buttons aren&#x27;t spaced that far apart. This little container goes a long way! Don&#x27;t count on being able to rip them in half by hand, though. They&#x27;re super tough. They&#x27;re also sticky enough to last all day (12+ hrs), even with opening your blouse. I already recommended this to a few friends.</li>
            <li> I have large breasts and this stuff doesn&#x27;t do a lot for me. Wishful thinking!</li>
            <li> the strips are fairly long, so I trim mine to sizes as needed. but these are VERY strong adhesive, so they&#x27;re very effective!</li>
            <li> Good product but a little soft the adhesive</li>
            <li> Works as designed. I use these every year for my  Mardi Gras ball gowns to keep the front of my dress where it should be if you know what I mean. They withstand hours of dancing. Love them.</li>
            <li> Worked well to keep a lose cowl neck dress from exposing my breasts. Did not hurt when removing the tape at night. Not good to try to tape your boobs to create cleavage when going bra-less.</li>
            <li> These are a great invention! Keeps the gaps between buttons closed, and kept my dress in place nicely. Other reviewers were correct when they said sweat can make the adhesive fail, but I still bought them anyway and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  I wish I had this years ago. I love boat neck shirts but hate that my bra strap always peeks out.  I don&#x27;t have to worry anymore.  This tape has made my life so much easier!</li>
            <li> I used these at my wedding to keep my dress sleeves and garter up. They worked wonderfully and I would recommend to any bride worried about wardrobe issues!</li>
            <li> This was perfect for sleeveless/off the shoulder dresses.  It worked perfectly, did not leave a residue, didn&#x27;t hurt to take off my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been planning weddings for years and never thought about using this product until a makeup artist informed me how great it works.  Oh she was right.  I was able to tape up a few bridesmaids into their dresses and also hem my own dress. This product is a miracle and must have.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my daughter to secure a formal dress. She felt free to move around knowing that her dress was not going gap in awkward places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tape comes in a strips that are easy to adhere and remove to skin and clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Used this for my wedding. Held up my lace garters and extras I used with work clothes.</li>
            <li> It came on time and as promised. I bought it to help hold up some thigh high socks (not stockings) and it worked wonderfully. I had it on for about six hours before the first sock pulled free and to be fair, I&#x27;d put the tape on my skin first then pulled the sock over it and had put the tape a bit too high. For it to hold up that well under that kind of strain is pretty awesome! I would definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> Since I discovered this a few years ago, I&#x27;ve never been without it.  Sweater won&#x27;t quite hand right?  Tape it!  Need an open cardigan to stay closed on cold day?  Tape it!  I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I did find tape at a better price.This hollywood stuff are hard to take the paper off but finding them at a better price .works better for me.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t stay put! Disappointed!</li>
            <li> Toupee tape worked better</li>
            <li> These are perfect and convenient. The small take-along tins are the best and I am so happy I got so many! I&#x27;ve used these almost every weekend thus far to hide bra straps.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I did without these.  I always had a problem with my bra strap showing.  I wear these almost everyday.  I usually put the tape on my bra then put my shirt over top so my straps stay in place and don&#x27;t show.</li>
            <li> Product really works for me &amp; the item was economically priced &amp; delivered super quick. Recommended seller</li>
            <li> These are not sticky like the ones I&#x27;ve voight at VS in the past. The shirt kept coming off all night. Lame</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  It&#x27;s a life saver for my daughters&#x27; dance competitions!  You can&#x27;t do without this.  It&#x27;s would be great for evening gowns and/or cocktail dresses for a special night out too.</li>
            <li> helpful for holding cochlear implant earpiece in place. So, it has many more uses than just hemming tape. Try it.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I am petite and small and if I am wearing clothes that have lower neckline the tendency is for my brassiere to show.  With this product, I can just tape it on my chest and cloth and the bra will not be seen anymore.</li>
