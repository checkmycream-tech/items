            <li>I write this review after wearing the polish with a topcoat for three days, and can happily report that it is still going strong.</li>
            <li>- Amazing effect.  </li>
            <li>The glitter payoff is spectacular.</li>
            <li>This glitter is spectacular.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping I would not need 3 layers of this polish to get the full effect of the look-it DOES look great after the 3 coats AND a good, shiny top coat.</li>
            <li>Amazing layered or as a top coat,</li>
            <li>Gorgeous twinkling in light</li>
            <li>I think it is just the right amount of glitter and the staying power is great.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve never been the type to spend more than about $7 on nail polish.  </li>
            <li>I love this polish.</li>
            <li>It turns out that I love this polish more than I anticipated.</li>
            <li>Girls love sparkly stuff.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this nail polish</li>
            <li>I feel like my nails are exotic mermaid nails, or butterfly wings.</li>
            <li>This polish is stunning.</li>

            <li>I was not disappointed!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Imagine how excited I was to try out the Deborah Lippmann line!</li>
            <li>Links so cool on your nails!</li>
            <li>I tried dl across the universe today and its lovely and unique.</li>
            <li>- Does not chip easily.  </li>
            <li>The flakes will not come off easily when you try to remove the polish.</li>
            <li>and I think this color was so beautiful, so I decided to buy one to match my blue clothes.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I finally took the chance and ordered Deborah Lippmann&#x27;s \\&quot;Across the Universe\\&quot;, it really is amazing!</li>
            <li>This is a very pretty polish and I am glad I bought it for the holidays...</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and even.</li>
            <li>the actual effect was great.</li>
            <li>one more thing, I highly recommended using a top coat after apply this to your nail.</li>
            <li>, this is easy to fix by a quick touch up on nail edges.</li>
            <li>if I had known that (I know I should have read the description but got excited at the color</li>
            <li>I first discovered Across the Universe because of those teases on Pinterest, and I was instantly IN LOVE.  </li>
            <li>Pros :   - Unique colour and glitter.</li>
            <li>well worth the cost!</li>
            <li>but, it is pretty :)</li>
            <li>Other than that, its a beautiful, fantasy like polish that will make your nails and hands stand out.</li>
            <li>It does not require any special techniques or equipment to apply.</li>
            <li>Wow this color is just amazing.</li>
            <li>My hard-working days include much hand washing and this hold up to many tasks.</li>
            <li>It is very dimensional and once i run out i will have to buy more.</li>
            <li>Sadly, while the nail polish is in a gorgeous color and goes on beautifully, it chips.</li>
            <li>Application is pretty easy</li>
            <li>Very pretty glitter,</li>
            <li>The nail polish does not dry up leaving the glitter easily picked away on the top of the nail.</li>
            <li>Looking forward to trying other colors of this amazing polish!</li>
            <li>The sparkle is beautiful and the large and small glitter pieces make it interesting and give your nails a lovely deep color.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>After hemming, hawing, goal-setting, scrimping, and lip-biting, I can say that this polish is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But this is completely worth it.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Seems like a quality product and the glitter in it sparkles nicely and stays flat on your nails.</li>
            <li>Very hip and cool, I get lots of complements too</li>
            <li>It is probably one of the most expensive nail polishes I&#x27;ve ever bought, but it&#x27;s great to work with.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care about dupes; since I rarely if ever spend this much on polish it was worth the $18 splurge.  </li>
            <li>I used a deep burgundy and it worked fine!</li>
            <li>The glitter floats in the polish and looks even better in person than in the pictures, especially in the sun.</li>
            <li>the glitter and color of this is exactly what you want and expect.  </li>
            <li>After Hours (deep indigo) &amp; I am completely in love.</li>
            <li>Needs a topcoat to last more than a day.</li>
            <li>I have used this alone, in a jelly sandwich, over the top of several enamels to extend my polish life.  </li>
            <li>I first saw a friend showing a photo of this polish</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get over how pretty this looks on my toes.</li>
            <li>When applied on a dark nail polish it gives an amazing depth to the nail polish.  </li>
            <li>with all glitter polishes, you&#x27;re going to want a pure acetone remover and lots of patience when it&#x27;s time to take it off.  </li>
            <li>Topped it off with a coat of Nubar 3-free fast dry shiny top coat.</li>
            <li>Flakes should come off much easier.</li>
            <li>I really do love the color, and the uniqueness of this polish, I&#x27;ve never really seen anything like it.</li>
            <li>If you like polishes that are sparkly and out of the ordinary, you&#x27;ll love this!</li>
            <li>Yes, it is difficult to get off if you don&#x27;t use the foil method but the trade off is splendid color and depth.  </li>
            <li>The polish is a little clear at first, but after the second coat is lovely!</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t as strong as other polishes either.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not thick, or too runny.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t ordinarily wear a dark polish in the summer but wearing this is a beautiful exception.  </li>
            <li>the only downfall is that you have to do about 3 or 4 coats to get the in the bottle color other than that i love it</li>
            <li>This polish looks so pretty in the product pics, but I have always hesitated about purchasing this polish because of the price, and I&#x27;m not really a fan of the polishes that have large glitter pieces in them.  </li>
            <li>The polish lasts a long time, but the glitters lose their top layer of color and turn silver on the nail after getting wet.  </li>
            <li>The only reason it did not get five stars is that it is very translucent.</li>
            <li>it looks like a dark glistening color from far away then up close the true beauty of the glitter chunks come through.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve found that it looks best layered over a dark solid color (I like black) - the base of this polish is blue but if you want opaque, you&#x27;re looking at using a lot of layers of a fairly pricey polish.  </li>
            <li>I have a hard time dropping this kind of money on a nail polish; even if it&#x27;s one I&#x27;ve wanted for a long time!  </li>
            <li>I would never normally purchase a nail polish that is this expensive or with such large glitter, however I decided to give it a try after a read all the good reviews it got.</li>
            <li>A bit disappointed, this is more of a top coat color, very sheer -</li>
            <li>Gel polishes do tend to be translucent, so if you want an opaque look, just put a coat of dark blue or teal polish on first, then 2 to 3 coats of \\&quot;Across the Universe\\&quot; and finish with a thick coat of Seche Vite to leave a smooth finish.</li>
            <li>And it has so much depth due to the colors in the bottle.</li>
            <li>For $20 I expected the lasting power to be at least as good as my other polishes, but it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It really looks like a fish on my nails, there&#x27;s large green/light blue sparkles surrounded by tiny dark blue pigment and tiny blue sparkles.</li>
            <li>so, not sure if it is worth the 18.00...</li>
            <li>A very runny black</li>
            <li>, awesome contrast to the dark blue base.</li>

            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that it looks best layered over a dark solid color (I like black) - the base of this polish is blue but if you want opaque, you&#x27;re looking at using a lot of layers of a fairly pricey polish.  </li>
            <li> I have a hard time dropping this kind of money on a nail polish; even if it&#x27;s one I&#x27;ve wanted for a long time!  </li>
            <li> I would never normally purchase a nail polish that is this expensive or with such large glitter, however I decided to give it a try after a read all the good reviews it got.</li>
            <li> A bit disappointed, this is more of a top coat color, very sheer -</li>
            <li> Gel polishes do tend to be translucent, so if you want an opaque look, just put a coat of dark blue or teal polish on first, then 2 to 3 coats of \\&quot;Across the Universe\\&quot; and finish with a thick coat of Seche Vite to leave a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> And it has so much depth due to the colors in the bottle.</li>
            <li> For $20 I expected the lasting power to be at least as good as my other polishes, but it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It really looks like a fish on my nails, there&#x27;s large green/light blue sparkles surrounded by tiny dark blue pigment and tiny blue sparkles.</li>
            <li> so, not sure if it is worth the 18.00...</li>
            <li> A very runny black</li>
            <li> , awesome contrast to the dark blue base.</li>
            <li> Even over a dark base coat I feel the polish looks best with at least 3 coats, and of course topped with a glossy topcoat to make everything really shine and to even out the texture.  </li>
            <li> It seems to take longer to dry than other glitter polishes I&#x27;ve used (namely OPI), but if you&#x27;re painting your nails you probably don&#x27;t have much planned in the next half hour</li>
            <li> still, other glittery blue polishes that are cheaper do not look much different...</li>
            <li> I had been eyeing this polish for a long time, but was always put off because of the price.</li>
            <li> Plus, the glitter that the brush deposits are few and far between.</li>
            <li> I should not have waited this long!</li>
            <li> ...you can use a generic nailpolish in blue or green, then put this one over it.</li>
            <li> You definitely need a base color to make this look nice.</li>
            <li> I wear my nails short and usually dark, and I can get about 5 hard-working days without chips.</li>
            <li> not much glitter when you apply.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t matter what color u put underneath just as long as its dark.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend wearing it over a black or dark blue polish instead.</li>
            <li> The dark blue gel base of this polish lets the glitter stay suspended, the glitter doesn&#x27;t just sit on top of the polish.</li>
            <li> There is literally no wear time for this or the other three Deborah Lippmann products that I purchased at Nordstom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Cons ::  -Difficult to wear on its own because it is quite difficult to apply.  </li>
            <li> not mommy friendly since it takes like 2 hours to dry :(</li>
            <li> Not worth my $18.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s already in a dark jelly</li>
            <li> so you have to be wearing dark nail polish under this polish to make it work at all.</li>
            <li> It chips without a base and top coat.</li>
            <li> It chips with a base and top coat.</li>
            <li> Wear is typical of gel polishes, tip wear shows after a day or so</li>
            <li> It is a little difficult to apply, and it takes about 3-4 coats for it to be completely opaque on the nails.</li>
            <li> If you use a plastic jar with soaked in acetone sponge type of polish remover, leave your finger in for few minutes.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant because in the past polishes with sparkles have chipped off.</li>
            <li> The base is thick and the glitter covers the nail easily in one coat.</li>
            <li> I do find that it doesn&#x27;t peel as easily as OPI glitter, which is a TERRIBLE habit on my part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> The lasting power is HORRIBLE, it was chipping pretty bad after only one day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this polish at least once a week.</li>
            <li> Its not super glittery due to the dark but translucent color of the base.</li>
            <li> Or if you want to wear it alone, dab it on thickly, rather than swiping on thin coats.</li>
            <li> Count at least 20 minutes and a lot of patience !</li>
            <li> It arrived late because the wrong zip code was placed on the package; however, it arrived just in time for me to apply it for my trip.  </li>
            <li> Worse customer service ever.</li>
            <li> Difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> - Extremely difficult to remove !</li>
            <li> :-(.</li>

            <li> It looks beautiful in the bottle... It is even more beautiful on the nail!  Application is pretty easy and I got so many compliments!  Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> When I saw this, I loved it. I was a little hesitant because in the past polishes with sparkles have chipped off. I write this review after wearing the polish with a topcoat for three days, and can happily report that it is still going strong. The polish is a little clear at first, but after the second coat is lovely!</li>
            <li> A bit disappointed, this is more of a top coat color, very sheer - if I had known that (I know I should have read the description but got excited at the color lol) I would have bypassed it.  Beautiful otherwise though. :)</li>
            <li> I would never normally purchase a nail polish that is this expensive or with such large glitter, however I decided to give it a try after a read all the good reviews it got. I was not disappointed! It is awesome! The nail polish does not dry up leaving the glitter easily picked away on the top of the nail. (I am a notorious nail polish picker) The glitter floats in the polish and looks even better in person than in the pictures, especially in the sun. It is a great product and I will not hesitate to purchase another Deborah Lippmann polish.</li>
            <li> I first discovered Across the Universe because of those teases on Pinterest, and I was instantly IN LOVE.  This was an obvious must-have.  However, I&#x27;ve never been the type to spend more than about $7 on nail polish.  After hemming, hawing, goal-setting, scrimping, and lip-biting, I can say that this polish is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that it looks best layered over a dark solid color (I like black) - the base of this polish is blue but if you want opaque, you&#x27;re looking at using a lot of layers of a fairly pricey polish.  The sparkle is beautiful and the large and small glitter pieces make it interesting and give your nails a lovely deep color.  Even over a dark base coat I feel the polish looks best with at least 3 coats, and of course topped with a glossy topcoat to make everything really shine and to even out the texture.  It seems to take longer to dry than other glitter polishes I&#x27;ve used (namely OPI), but if you&#x27;re painting your nails you probably don&#x27;t have much planned in the next half hour anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all glitter polishes, you&#x27;re going to want a pure acetone remover and lots of patience when it&#x27;s time to take it off.  I do find that it doesn&#x27;t peel as easily as OPI glitter, which is a TERRIBLE habit on my part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, in a couple places I&#x27;ve seen this referred to as a gel polish - it is NOT a gel polish.  It does not require any special techniques or equipment to apply.</li>
            <li> I was hoping I would not need 3 layers of this polish to get the full effect of the look-it DOES look great after the 3 coats AND a good, shiny top coat. Mine did peel off in chucks but he next day, however. :-(. Maybe a good look for an evening out-that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> This was perfect. I love it &amp; even ordered another for my cousin for her birthday! She loves it, too...I recommend it if you like blue.</li>
            <li> I love this polish. It turns out that I love this polish more than I anticipated. It arrived late because the wrong zip code was placed on the package; however, it arrived just in time for me to apply it for my trip.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I had been looking at this nail polish for quite awhile and I finally decided to purchase it. I should not have waited this long! Across The Universe is a gorgeous polish! The polish has this great depth and sparkle. It is probably one of the most expensive nail polishes I&#x27;ve ever bought, but it&#x27;s great to work with. Goes on smooth and even. The smell isn&#x27;t as strong as other polishes either. I would definitely spend money on another Deborah Lippmann polish in the future.</li>
            <li> Difficult to remove. Seems like a quality product and the glitter in it sparkles nicely and stays flat on your nails.</li>
            <li> Pros :   - Unique colour and glitter. When applied on a dark nail polish it gives an amazing depth to the nail polish.  - Does not chip easily.  - Amazing effect.  Cons ::  -Difficult to wear on its own because it is quite difficult to apply.  - It takes some time to understand how to apply it so that the glitter is evenly applied on the nail.  - Extremely difficult to remove ! Count at least 20 minutes and a lot of patience !</li>
            <li> Whoopee do-da, it has sparkles. I will stick with my trusted Target for nail polishes. You definitely need a base color to make this look nice. Not worth my $18.</li>
            <li> Girls love sparkly stuff.  This is a perfect gift at a discounted price.  Yes, it maybe expense for nail polish, but it is a quality product that does not crack.</li>
            <li> I love it, looks great and the best colors.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this nail polish the only downfall is that you have to do about 3 or 4 coats to get the in the bottle color other than that i love it</li>
            <li> ...you can use a generic nailpolish in blue or green, then put this one over it. The flakes will not come off easily when you try to remove the polish. If you use a plastic jar with soaked in acetone sponge type of polish remover, leave your finger in for few minutes. Flakes should come off much easier. Other than that, its a beautiful, fantasy like polish that will make your nails and hands stand out.</li>
            <li> This polish looks so pretty in the product pics, but I have always hesitated about purchasing this polish because of the price, and I&#x27;m not really a fan of the polishes that have large glitter pieces in them.  I&#x27;m so glad I finally took the chance and ordered Deborah Lippmann&#x27;s \\&quot;Across the Universe\\&quot;, it really is amazing! The dark blue gel base of this polish lets the glitter stay suspended, the glitter doesn&#x27;t just sit on top of the polish.This gives the polish an incredible depth that is unique. Gel polishes do tend to be translucent, so if you want an opaque look, just put a coat of dark blue or teal polish on first, then 2 to 3 coats of \\&quot;Across the Universe\\&quot; and finish with a thick coat of Seche Vite to leave a smooth finish. Just gorgeous! Wear is typical of gel polishes, tip wear shows after a day or so, this is easy to fix by a quick touch up on nail edges. If you like polishes that are sparkly and out of the ordinary, you&#x27;ll love this!</li>
            <li> 2nd bottle~~~Best polish ever~!!!</li>
            <li> Gift for girlfriend - she loved it.</li>
            <li> The polish lasts a long time, but the glitters lose their top layer of color and turn silver on the nail after getting wet.  So it ends up being a navy jelly polish with silver glitter. Does anyone else have this issue?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this polish at least once a week. The glitter payoff is spectacular. And it has so much depth due to the colors in the bottle. I feel like my nails are exotic mermaid nails, or butterfly wings. Gorgeous polish, well worth the cost!</li>
            <li> This polish is stunning. Beautiful blues, and greens. It&#x27;s not thick, or too runny. Try applying one or two coats over a solid polish. Or if you want to wear it alone, dab it on thickly, rather than swiping on thin coats. Looking forward to trying other colors of this amazing polish!</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty polish and I am glad I bought it for the holidays...still, other glittery blue polishes that are cheaper do not look much different...so, not sure if it is worth the 18.00...but, it is pretty :)</li>
            <li> I have a hard time dropping this kind of money on a nail polish; even if it&#x27;s one I&#x27;ve wanted for a long time!  But this is completely worth it.  Amazing layered or as a top coat, the glitter and color of this is exactly what you want and expect.  I am in love with it, get great compliments, and the long-lasting wearability helps to make the price justifiable.</li>
            <li> Wow this color is just amazing. I put two coats to my nails and it look so beautiful. I&#x27;m so stoked. Love the color, everything. Definitely worth the price.(: Hope this helped</li>
            <li> This polish is amazing!!!  I don&#x27;t care about dupes; since I rarely if ever spend this much on polish it was worth the $18 splurge.  It&#x27;s already in a dark jelly but I put 2 coats of ATU over 1 coat of L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s After Hours (deep indigo) &amp; I am completely in love. Topped it off with a coat of Nubar 3-free fast dry shiny top coat. I wouldn&#x27;t ordinarily wear a dark polish in the summer but wearing this is a beautiful exception.  Gorgeous twinkling in light, awesome contrast to the dark blue base.</li>
            <li> I was looking for this color and I&#x27;m glad I found this brand too! looks amazing on! Very hip and cool, I get lots of complements too</li>
            <li> The base is thick and the glitter covers the nail easily in one coat. Needs a topcoat to last more than a day.</li>
            <li> I was a fan of Deb Lippmann before I chose this color! I wear my nails short and usually dark, and I can get about 5 hard-working days without chips. My hard-working days include much hand washing and this hold up to many tasks. A pedicure lasts 3 weeks!</li>
            <li> This glitter is spectacular.  There is nothing I have seen that even closely compares.  Yes, it is difficult to get off if you don&#x27;t use the foil method but the trade off is splendid color and depth.  I have used this alone, in a jelly sandwich, over the top of several enamels to extend my polish life.  I think it is just the right amount of glitter and the staying power is great.</li>
            <li> not much glitter when you apply.  not mommy friendly since it takes like 2 hours to dry :( not recommended</li>
            <li> I am a nail polish fiend! I love me some nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine how excited I was to try out the Deborah Lippmann line! Sadly, while the nail polish is in a gorgeous color and goes on beautifully, it chips. It chips within four hours. It chips without a base and top coat. It chips with a base and top coat. It chips. There is literally no wear time for this or the other three Deborah Lippmann products that I purchased at Nordstom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tweeted about it. I sent emails to the company. Nothing. Nada. Worse customer service ever.</li>
            <li> Links so cool on your nails! Doesn&#x27;t matter what color u put underneath just as long as its dark. I used a deep burgundy and it worked fine!</li>
            <li> The only reason it did not get five stars is that it is very translucent. It took about 5 layers for each nail to match the color of the bottle, nonetheless it is GORGEOUS! It really looks like a fish on my nails, there&#x27;s large green/light blue sparkles surrounded by tiny dark blue pigment and tiny blue sparkles. I got so many compliments wearing it! It also have the colors of an abalone shell, the purples and greens and blues are  to die for! It is very dimensional and once i run out i will have to buy more.</li>
            <li> I had been eyeing this polish for a long time, but was always put off because of the price. So finally I just decided to get it. I really do love the color, and the uniqueness of this polish, I&#x27;ve never really seen anything like it. It is a little difficult to apply, and it takes about 3-4 coats for it to be completely opaque on the nails. I&#x27;d recommend wearing it over a black or dark blue polish instead. The lasting power is HORRIBLE, it was chipping pretty bad after only one day. For $20 I expected the lasting power to be at least as good as my other polishes, but it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Very pretty glitter, but I abhor the polish color! A very runny black so you have to be wearing dark nail polish under this polish to make it work at all. Plus, the glitter that the brush deposits are few and far between. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I first saw a friend showing a photo of this polish and I think this color was so beautiful, so I decided to buy one to match my blue clothes.&lt;br /&gt;And the actual effect was great. If you wear this out on a sunny day, you will notice that your nail&#x27;s shining like a rock star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and one more thing, I highly recommended using a top coat after apply this to your nail.</li>
            <li> Best nail polish I ever bought.  Totally worth the price.  Takes several coats but lasts a week!  Got complimented on it every day!!!!!</li>
            <li> The color is awesome on and it goes on so well.  It&#x27;s a great product.  Pricey for nail polish, but like I said it&#x27;s an awesome color.</li>
            <li> I tried dl across the universe today and its lovely and unique. If u hav to try just one dl get this one:-) it looks like a dark glistening color from far away then up close the true beauty of the glitter chunks come through. Its not super glittery due to the dark but translucent color of the base. I can&#x27;t get over how pretty this looks on my toes. Ordering more dl nail laquers today!!!</li>
