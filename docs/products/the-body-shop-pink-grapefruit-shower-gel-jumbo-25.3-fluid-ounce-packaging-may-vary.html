            <li>This is my favorite grapefruit gel.</li>
            <li>I love this body wash, and I have the body butter to go with it.</li>
            <li>When I ordered it I was not quite sure if I would get three bottles totaling 25.3 oz or just one bottle of that size.  </li>
            <li>Grapefruit used to be my favorite liquid soap from The Body Shop, but they discontinued it about a year ago.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>My favorite soap</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many of them too.</li>
            <li>Try it you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>my husband love this</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t overwhelming yet smells very fresh.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a good price for such a large bottle from a good brand, but it&#x27;s important to know this.</li>
            <li>Love this shower gel...leaves your skin fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good start to the day and leaves my skin soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>The frangrance is light and fresh!</li>
            <li>It leaves the skin smooth but not squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>What a fresh smell this shower gel has!  </li>
            <li>This one smells like the grapefruit at the breakfast table--tart, energizing, fresh!  </li>
            <li>It smells like real fresh grapefruit not artificial scent at all, very clean and crisp.</li>
            <li>You just feel clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>We have tried many different scented gels - this is without a doubt the best - as long as you like the smell of grapefruit.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>He is not one to say that to his mother, so I know it must be special.</li>
            <li>I buy good grapefruit scented candles for the same reason.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by how much I liked the scent.  </li>
            <li>Tart and sweet.</li>
            <li>I love this product, love the aroma and your skin is left fresh and clean without any drying effects.  </li>
            <li>I just love this stuff, and I love that it&#x27;s on Amazon because it ends up being SO MUCH cheaper to buy it here than in the actual Body Shop store.</li>
            <li>Like another reviewer said, it smells like a fresh cut grapefruit.  </li>
            <li>and then you get the bonus of leaving the whole bathroom with a fresh grapefruit scent!</li>
            <li>After an intense workout at the gym.. a scent like this is just what you need to feel clean and relaxed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Smells so amazing in the shower, but this scent doesn&#x27;t carry on your skin for very long.</li>
            <li>Very gentle...</li>
            <li>Nice scent but a little too sweet for me</li>
            <li>This is my first try with the shower gel.  </li>
            <li>Even the ones at Target are pretty pricey.  </li>
            <li>Plan on ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li>First, a clarification of what you get in this order.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a huge fan of grapefruit scents but had heard good things about this one.  </li>
            <li>I got a small bottle of this and loved the scent.</li>
            <li>have to confess that $15 for a shower gel is a little more than I am typically willing to pay for a shower gel, but the scent made it worth it for me.  </li>
            <li>25 oz bottle is a fairly large size, but still reasonable that it fits well in the shower</li>
            <li>I have used the Body Shop Pink Grapefruit lotion and love that.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s something about the grapefruit that really helps the acne go away.  </li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t care for the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really does smell like cat urine when it hits cardboard.</li>
            <li>I can just find body wash so much cheaper</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t compete with your perfume, but It really helps wake you up  in the morning.  </li>
            <li>very engry about this.</li>
            <li>Just regular vinegar that we buy at the grocery store (can be any kind: apple cider, white, wine, rice, whatever is cheapest).</li>
            <li>The scent is pretty strong at first, but calms down after you rinse it off.  </li>
            <li>I tried other manufacturer&#x27;s grapefruit shower gels, but they were all &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; grapefruit scent, which is okay but reminds me too much of Froot Loops.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great pick-me-up during your morning shower and a little goes a long way if you use one of those shower poofs.</li>
            <li>And it does make some decent bubbles without having to use a quarter of a bottle each time.</li>
            <li>but the cost is too high...</li>
            <li>Maybe, my expectation was too high?  </li>
            <li>The scent is exactly like pink grapefruit, with just the right amount of citrus bitterness.  </li>
            <li>I tried a sample at The Body Shop when I was visiting out of state and there is no store near me and just had to have this!  </li>
            <li>His back has not been this clean and clear for ten years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered the large bottle for my daughter&#x27;s Christmas present.</li>
            <li>try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is similar to the old favorite liquid soap but a little stronger.  </li>
            <li>This is the only Body Shop shower gel that smells like the real thing.  </li>
            <li>does all that you should expect from a bath/shower gel as far as concentration, foaming and cleaning</li>
            <li>This is just the boost you need if you&#x27;re an early riser it will wake you up</li>
            <li>but with a slight sweet not bitter smell.  </li>
            <li>The pump is hard to get started tho, but still love it, second time i have ordered it.</li>
            <li>The first bottle that was sent had a broken pump that Amazon quickly replaced for us.</li>
            <li>It was okay in the beginning but after a few uses it turned into a scenty mess!</li>
            <li>Less so maybe when diluted in water but not so much so that I would purchase this fragrance</li>
            <li>The smell is a little to much like a grapefruit for me</li>
            <li>The size I received in the sale was only a little over 8 ounces, but it seems to lather really well and will last quite awhile.  </li>

            <li> The size I received in the sale was only a little over 8 ounces, but it seems to lather really well and will last quite awhile.  </li>
            <li> I buy this for my brother who has bad back acne -- it is the only body wash that works for him, and it&#x27;s an amazing deal to find this for $15.00 or so for a 25oz bottle.  </li>
            <li> Judging by how well it lathers, I believe this 23 ounce size will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know wether lost on the way by Chinese Express or Amazon haven&#x27;t send to me at all, i only get big one, no other 2 small sample like picture discribed.</li>
            <li> A large bottle of this has seriously lasted me a year.</li>
            <li> Let that dry for 20 minutes or so</li>
            <li> and I do suffer from dry skin.</li>
            <li> The cap was loose and some of the product had leaked throughout the box.</li>
            <li> They sold their stuff at small fortunes -- and it came in super cheap pumps that made it impossible to use!</li>
            <li> Just have him lie on the ground and then take a little bowl and pour some vinegar in that...then use a paper towel and dab the vineger all over his back.  </li>
            <li> When I saw Pink Grapefruit Shower Gel from The Body Shop</li>
            <li> This means it will continue to provide soap until there is very little left.  </li>

            <li> I love this body wash.  It smells wonderful and cleans well!</li>
            <li> This is the only Body Shop shower gel that smells like the real thing.  The scent is exactly like pink grapefruit, with just the right amount of citrus bitterness.  All of the other Body Shop gels that I&#x27;ve tried were cloyingly candy-sweet and nauseating.</li>
            <li> What a fresh smell this shower gel has!  Smells like you just peeled a grapefruit but with a slight sweet not bitter smell.  This is my first try with the shower gel.  I have used the Body Shop Pink Grapefruit lotion and love that.</li>
            <li> A large bottle of this has seriously lasted me a year. I also love that it is a fair trade product and has a light smell :) The smell does not bother my allergies either.</li>
            <li> Nice scent but a little too sweet for me</li>
            <li> This is one of the nicest shower gels I have every tried. It truly smells like grapefruit and is wonderful. I have bought some for friends and family. I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> We have tried many different scented gels - this is without a doubt the best - as long as you like the smell of grapefruit.&lt;br /&gt;It does all that you should expect from a bath/shower gel as far as concentration, foaming and cleaning and then you get the bonus of leaving the whole bathroom with a fresh grapefruit scent!</li>
            <li> I buy this for my brother who has bad back acne -- it is the only body wash that works for him, and it&#x27;s an amazing deal to find this for $15.00 or so for a 25oz bottle.  There&#x27;s something about the grapefruit that really helps the acne go away.  He uses this in combination with a vinegar treatment.  Just regular vinegar that we buy at the grocery store (can be any kind: apple cider, white, wine, rice, whatever is cheapest). Just have him lie on the ground and then take a little bowl and pour some vinegar in that...then use a paper towel and dab the vineger all over his back.  Let that dry for 20 minutes or so and then he takes a shower using this grapefruit body wash.  His back has not been this clean and clear for ten years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those without acne problems, this grapefruit body wash is invigorating and relaxing. There&#x27;s something about the grapefruit oils that makes your skin feel great and also the scent makes you wake up and want to face the day with strength. I just love this stuff, and I love that it&#x27;s on Amazon because it ends up being SO MUCH cheaper to buy it here than in the actual Body Shop store.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a week now. I have yet to see any improvements on my back/chest acne but for one thing it didn&#x27;t make it worse. Hopefully, as other reviews have said it, it&#x27;ll help with some of my body acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is wonderful. The moment you pump the bottle you smell the grapefruit. It also foams up very easily so I don&#x27;t need to pump a lot of the product. It leaves the skin smooth but not squeaky clean. I would use a different body scrub couple times a week along with this body wash.</li>
            <li> I love the bubbles you get when using it as a bubble bath. It&#x27;s better than most and it doesn&#x27;t try my skin but I really don&#x27;t care for the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers have mentioned that it smells a lot like cat urine. Some of the product ha leaked out of the bottle onto the bottom of cardboard box when I received it. It really does smell like cat urine when it hits cardboard. Less so maybe when diluted in water but not so much so that I would purchase this fragrance again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product hasn&#x27;t overly dried out my skin and I do suffer from dry skin. And it does make some decent bubbles without having to use a quarter of a bottle each time. Four stars for those aspects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d purchase another one of their shower gels again but definitely not this fragrance, which like taste, is always subjective. You might like it. One star off for the smell.</li>
            <li> suave made a grapefruit gel for a while and i really loved it then... the price .. well you couldnt beat it.... then i found this...its grapefruitty alright and just the product itself i love... but the cost is too high... so while i might buy it again.... i am definitely hoarding it now...</li>
            <li> I love it and I will never get over the scent of grapefruit, it&#x27;s so energizing and how it foams for shaving is wonderful</li>
            <li> I order this over and over....Very gentle...I have exema on my hands...use this instead of harsh soap at kitchen sink....love the smell !</li>
            <li> Perhaps there isn&#x27;t a fresher, perkier scent around than grapefruit. I buy good grapefruit scented candles for the same reason. THIS soap is quite nice, with a great smell. My biggest complaint is the pump-bottle itself. It&#x27;s TERRIBLE. It sticks, it&#x27;s a short pump... I gotta fight with it every usage. I don&#x27;t get it!! I had this very same issue with an expensive facial product my ex-gf used to sell, for a renowned skin care company. They sold their stuff at small fortunes -- and it came in super cheap pumps that made it impossible to use! Same issue with this!! Hey, BODY SHOP!!! Spend another 25cents wholesale on your bottles and get something that works!!!    Otherwise, I love the product. Smells great, cleans well... and the scent lasts and lasts. But the pump SUCKS!!!</li>
            <li> love the smell, but the price is too expensive so I will not be getting it again...I can just find body wash so much cheaper</li>
            <li> If you like grapefruit then this is a great shower gel! The scent is strong but not overpowering and the jumbo bottle lasts FOREVER!  It&#x27;s a great pick-me-up during your morning shower and a little goes a long way if you use one of those shower poofs.</li>
            <li> It was okay in the beginning but after a few uses it turned into a scenty mess! YUCK!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased the grapefruit shower gel as part of a sale TBS was running a couple weeks ago.  I hadn&#x27;t smelled it, but it got really good reviews so I gave it a try.  The size I received in the sale was only a little over 8 ounces, but it seems to lather really well and will last quite awhile.  I was surprised by how much I liked the scent.  Like another reviewer said, it smells like a fresh cut grapefruit.  The scent is pretty strong at first, but calms down after you rinse it off.  It won&#x27;t compete with your perfume, but It really helps wake you up  in the morning.  And, it doesn&#x27;t keep you awake at night.  You just feel clean and refreshed.  Really nice.  I don&#x27;t think $15 for 23 oz. is a bad price, especially comparing other shower gels in smaller sizes to it.  Even the ones at Target are pretty pricey.  Judging by how well it lathers, I believe this 23 ounce size will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Maybe, my expectation was too high?  It does have a nice smell.  However, I want more from my shower gel.</li>
            <li> Love this shower gel...leaves your skin fresh and clean. I hate grapefruit but i love the smell of this.Entire family uses it. The pump is hard to get started tho, but still love it, second time i have ordered it. Plan on ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know wether lost on the way by Chinese Express or Amazon haven&#x27;t send to me at all, i only get big one, no other 2 small sample like picture discribed. very engry about this.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite grapefruit gel. The price can&#x27;t be beat. Very good value when you buy the large bottle.</li>
            <li> Love love love it! The frangrance is light and fresh!</li>
            <li> This smells just like grapefruit, and it is delicious! I love this body wash, and I have the body butter to go with it. Tart and sweet. Yum.</li>
            <li> I got a small bottle of this and loved the scent. It isn&#x27;t overwhelming yet smells very fresh. I ordered the large bottle for my daughter&#x27;s Christmas present. The cap was loose and some of the product had leaked throughout the box. I contacted Amazon and they sent another bottle in plenty of time for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep a bottle in my shower all the time. It&#x27;s especially great to use after a hot day in the sun.</li>
            <li> This is just the boost you need if you&#x27;re an early riser it will wake you up&lt;br /&gt;... I&#x27;m not a huge fan of grapefruit scents but had heard good things about this one.  I love it! After an intense workout at the gym.. a scent like this is just what you need to feel clean and relaxed.&lt;br /&gt;I like to rotate body wash scents and when this one runs out I will definitely be purchasing it again especially with the summer coming up!</li>
            <li> First, a clarification of what you get in this order. The stock photo shows three bottles for some reason.  You get only one (the largest one) in this order.  That one bottle is 25.3 ounces.  When I ordered it I was not quite sure if I would get three bottles totaling 25.3 oz or just one bottle of that size.  Not a big deal either way, just wanted to clarify.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pink Grapefruit used to be my favorite liquid soap from The Body Shop, but they discontinued it about a year ago.  When I saw Pink Grapefruit Shower Gel from The Body Shop I figured I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is similar to the old favorite liquid soap but a little stronger.  I like it!  It smells like real fresh grapefruit not artificial scent at all, very clean and crisp. The gel lathers up well. I use it as a gel in the shower, sometimes as bubble bath, and occasionally as liquid soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am attaching a photo under customer photos which shows the bottle from the back.  This image shows you the feeder tube which goes generously to the bottom of the bottle.  This means it will continue to provide soap until there is very little left.  I also put a pen in the photo for size reference. 25 oz bottle is a fairly large size, but still reasonable that it fits well in the shower caddy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to confess that $15 for a shower gel is a little more than I am typically willing to pay for a shower gel, but the scent made it worth it for me.  So I recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
            <li> I was really only looking for a shower get in a pump bottle when I came across this product. I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Smells so amazing in the shower, but this scent doesn&#x27;t carry on your skin for very long. It&#x27;s still a good price for such a large bottle from a good brand, but it&#x27;s important to know this. The pump works well and is handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note-This order ONLY COMES WITH BIG bottle. Not the additional two small ones pictured. This should be updated by Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product! I hope they never stop making it. I&#x27;ve been using it for years now, and never get tired of it.</li>
            <li> You use it in the shower and it smells great but then after you are out and about, it doesn&#x27;t stay with you and seems to smell acrid after.  I would not buy this again, and it was pricey.</li>
            <li> The grapefruit fragrance is very refreshing and the pump makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d bought this in the 90s and was unable to find that scent again when my bottle was used up.  I tried other manufacturer&#x27;s grapefruit shower gels, but they were all &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; grapefruit scent, which is okay but reminds me too much of Froot Loops.  I was so happy to see the Body Shop is making this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS one&#x27;s not sweet!  This one smells like the grapefruit at the breakfast table--tart, energizing, fresh!  Grapefruit scent is sometimes used in aromatherapy as a mood-lifter, and this does that for me.  It&#x27;s a good start to the day and leaves my skin soft and clean.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product, love the aroma and your skin is left fresh and clean without any drying effects.  I wonderful morning shower wakeup.  You have to try it.  I tried a sample at The Body Shop when I was visiting out of state and there is no store near me and just had to have this!  It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Great smell for morning shower.  My favorite soap and I have tried a lot. Skin feels great and the smell lasts.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little to much like a grapefruit for me but it does wake you up in the morning. The first bottle that was sent had a broken pump that Amazon quickly replaced for us.</li>
            <li> This is truly the nicest, cleanest smell of all the &#x27;Body Shop&#x27; fragrances. I&#x27;ve tried so many of them too. Try it you&#x27;ll love it. Whenever I take a shower and my son is home from college he always says, &amp;#34;Mom you smell soooo good&amp;#34;. He is not one to say that to his mother, so I know it must be special.</li>
            <li> Great product and it leaves a wonderful grapefruit smell</li>
            <li> my husband love this so do i</li>
