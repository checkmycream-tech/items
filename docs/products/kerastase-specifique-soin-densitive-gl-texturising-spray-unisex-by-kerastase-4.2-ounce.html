    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It gives my hair a wonderful manageability, softness and shine.  </li>
            <li>A bit pricey, however, my stylist says my hair is in the best condition he has ever seen, and he is NOT the one who recommended it&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li>Great stuff for lifting hair roots.</li>
            <li>This product was a great find...</li>
            <li>Good product for thinning and aging hair.  </li>
            <li>Loved the product; didn&#x27;t like the price.  </li>
            <li>now I love the product even more!</li>
            <li>I love this product makes my hair feel amazing and seems to be growing thicker and faster.</li>
            <li>but Kerastase offers, in my opinion, the best hair care products on the market.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>I was able to purchase it for almost $15 cheaper...</li>
            <li>This takes care of it and helps with static electricity, another issue.  </li>
            <li>my hair scrunches up very nice and seems much thicker</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair and needed a light weight product for root lift.</li>
            <li>Kept clean, silky and manageable.  </li>
            <li>Items were received quickly.  </li>
            <li>Smell is great &amp; product doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.  </li>
            <li>Really a good product to build body in fine, limp hair.  </li>
            <li>but worth it to me.</li>
            <li>I tried many products and most of them never really worked</li>
            <li>It was shipped quickly and it really does give your hair volume.</li>
            <li>For fine, chemically treated hair or hair that is exposed to much sun, this product is terrific.  </li>
            <li>like I do this product really helps put some fullness to your hair.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>Most products tend to either make my hair frizzy or flatten it down since it&#x27;s gotten thinner.  </li>
            <li>I just bought Organix Bamboo volumizer that works way better and was less than 1/3 the cost of this stuff.</li>
            <li>The girls at the salon highly recommended it for hair volume...</li>
            <li>I struggled most of my life with hair that is limp and damaged by constant coloring but this product really made the difference.</li>
            <li>When I bought it, I was a bit surprised that it was $40, but bought it any way.  </li>
            <li>It really seems to help with styling the hair unlike many other similar products I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li>It does not dry your hair and makes a visible difference when you style your hair.</li>
            <li>In my opinion this is the product every person with thin or fine hair should have.</li>
            <li>I have thin silky hair and always need to use some kind of the volumizing foam to give a little lift and stop them from flying.</li>

            <li> Great stuff for lifting hair roots.</li>
            <li> I love this product makes my hair feel amazing and seems to be growing thicker and faster. my hair scrunches up very nice and seems much thicker I  would recommend this product</li>
            <li> Good product for thinning and aging hair.  Items were received quickly.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  If anyone has thin hair like I do this product really helps put some fullness to your hair.</li>
            <li> This product was a great find...I bought  a bottle of this product at my hair salon.  The girls at the salon highly recommended it for hair volume...I found it works well on my hair. When I bought it, I was a bit surprised that it was $40, but bought it any way.  Loved the product; didn&#x27;t like the price.  When I needed to replace the spray, I went to Amazon.  I was able to purchase it for almost $15 cheaper...now I love the product even more!</li>
            <li> Really a good product to build body in fine, limp hair.  It does not dry your hair and makes a visible difference when you style your hair.</li>
            <li> While getting a hair cut at Sassoons this product was used on my thinning hair and I was so please with the results and texture.  No sticky, clumpy hair.  Kept clean, silky and manageable.  Pricy but worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair and needed a light weight product for root lift. This does the trick. I will continue to use with no reservations.</li>
            <li> Smell is great &amp; product doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.  I have very thin flat hair &amp; using this product gives my hair some life!!!</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday, and have very thin hair.  Nothing restores the body back to my hair like this product does!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since it came on the market.  It is the only texturising product that does not make you hair feel stiff or dirty.  It is weightless and provides fullness.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this is the product every person with thin or fine hair should have. I struggled most of my life with hair that is limp and damaged by constant coloring but this product really made the difference. It gives my hair a wonderful manageability, softness and shine.  I tried many products and most of them never really worked but Kerastase offers, in my opinion, the best hair care products on the market. I also use the shampoo &amp;#34;Specifique&amp;#34; and the leave on &amp;#34;Ciment&amp;#34; both from Kerastase.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if this is working.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  I spray it on my hair along with a keratin spray after I wash my hair.  It does seem to help it not lie too flat but without giving it frizzy poof.  I&#x27;ve bought it twice now and will continue to use it.  Most products tend to either make my hair frizzy or flatten it down since it&#x27;s gotten thinner.  This is one of the few that works for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using their (Kerastase) scalp serum for hair that is thinning.  My Kerritin levels have been low and so I&#x27;ve been losing my hair very slowly.  This product adds volume.</li>
            <li> If there&#x27;s any moisture in the air, my hair frizzes.  This takes care of it and helps with static electricity, another issue.  I have recommended this product to several members of my friends and family.</li>
            <li> For fine, chemically treated hair or hair that is exposed to much sun, this product is terrific.  A bit pricey, however, my stylist says my hair is in the best condition he has ever seen, and he is NOT the one who recommended it&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> Spent a lot of money fo rthis and it didn&#x27;t do much. I didn&#x27;t notice a volume difference in my hair. It wasn&#x27;t oily so that was a plus. But for the  money, not worth it. I just bought Organix Bamboo volumizer that works way better and was less than 1/3 the cost of this stuff.</li>
            <li> It was shipped quickly and it really does give your hair volume.</li>
            <li> This product was introduced to me by my hairdresser. I have thin silky hair and always need to use some kind of the volumizing foam to give a little lift and stop them from flying. After application Texturizing Spray you don&#x27;t feel any stickiness but your hair have body (not overwhelming) but yet looking sleek. Cons: a bit pricy.</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with my styling mousse.  Spritz just a small amount at roots rubbing around with finger tips</li>
            <li> It really seems to help with styling the hair unlike many other similar products I have tried in the past.</li>
