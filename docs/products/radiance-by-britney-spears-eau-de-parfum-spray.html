            <li>About the perfume, it is Ok</li>
            <li>It delicious, but if you like to wear all they your perfume, you should spray it several times...</li>
            <li>I love this fragance.</li>

            <li>I love this scent it stays on me for 24 hrs....</li>

            <li>i love it</li>

            <li>I love this scent.</li>
            <li>I love the bottle and concept for her Fantasy Twist.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I love this perfume a lot.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find it in the stores any more</li>
            <li>I should be purchasing something more sophisticated...</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so feminine and lovely.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what changed, but it&#x27;s a refreshing scent</li>
            <li>I love this scent</li>
            <li>Im in love with this... very very happy.smell so good</li>
            <li>, I recommend this perfume to girls from age 20 to adult 40 to 50 years, is sweet floral smells delicious!</li>
            <li>The first moment I sprayed it I loved it.</li>
            <li>Buy this if you must, but Cosmic Radiance deserves a Buy and enjoy:)</li>
            <li>bad movie pun and all, when my wife wears this, it smells awesome, its not for just teens, it actually is a very great perfume</li>
            <li>Not only did I find this item for a great price, but 3.3 ounces is a huge quantity!</li>
            <li>-(&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone who loves floral musky scents that last longer than many others, great deal for the price.</li>
            <li>It is strong yet not overpowering, unless of course you spray it 5 times.</li>
            <li>I will either end up giving this perfume away, strong perfumes bother me and&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It comes in a very pretty bottle as well!</li>
            <li>Huge bottle.</li>
            <li>My order came with free shipping and it arrived within three days of my purchase.</li>
            <li>Lol  idk  if im just a big baby....</li>
            <li>I have never seen pets appear to enjoy perfume.</li>
            <li>My wife and I both enjoy it.  </li>
            <li>Very nice scent and at a low price</li>
            <li>Very fresh</li>
            <li>Very light scent with a pretty bottle.</li>
            <li>It is strong and bold.</li>
            <li>I bought it based on all the great reviews of how long it lasts</li>
            <li>so i am sure a badass cougar would not agree ;)</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend if you love fruity sexy scents that are not to overpowering!</li>
            <li>It also transfers so well on my skin, it&#x27;s really true to what you smell in the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Really???!!</li>
            <li>It makes you feel fresh, pretty and clean.</li>
            <li>I just needed something cost effective for daily wear hence, this suited me well.</li>
            <li>Its not the fun fruity bubblegum smell that I am used too</li>
            <li>but a friend recommended this scent, and being the wild, adventurous woman that I am (or like to think that I am, anyway)</li>
            <li>Anyway, it is not very sophisticated but pleasant, a very nice scent as described in other reviews.</li>
            <li>&quot; It&#x27;s a very fresh Tuberose/Berry type of scent, very floral.</li>
            <li>Over the years I have tested most if not all of Britney&#x27;s line but this particular scent seems very grown up.</li>
            <li>(it smells like grapes too much) and prefer the original Radiance.</li>
            <li>This is a very radiant smelling scent, a pretty fruity floral which is more on the fruity side, and I honestly think it was marketed extremely well with the name.</li>
            <li>Tuberose has a very strong distinctive scent, so i would expect a fragrance with tuberose in it to last longer on the skin.</li>
            <li>, I thought it would be awesome as other Britney&#x27;s perfumes, however I noticed that smells a little bit light (for me).</li>
            <li>Ok first of all vendor was quick i received same week</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet, but a natural sweet.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and packaged very well.</li>
            <li>So yeah, make sure you really like it before ordering a bottle, because lasting power is extraordinary.</li>
            <li>The bottle is also beautiful with the blue and pink gemstones all around.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>First spray</li>
            <li>but  the lil extra bonuses the seller sent along with my perfume was heart touching  lol&lt;</li>
            <li>exact email</li>
            <li>so it does smell great and does last for a long time, all day, but not on all skin types :</li>
            <li>i love this,first smelled a sample of it at a local walmart and sprayed it on my sleeve, by the time i finished shopping</li>
            <li>The scent doesn&#x27;t really last and the fragrance itself is not all that appealing.</li>
            <li>a funny thing happened...</li>
            <li>Yet gives a great long lasting scent!!</li>
            <li>Love this sweet and fresh perfume for everyday.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the extra goodies too :)</li>
            <li>When I first purchased this fragrance at Walgreens in 2011, I didn&#x27;t really like the smell.</li>
            <li>You can find it at pretty much every drug store, so it should be easy enough to find it in your town to try it.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too strong that it bothers people, but its noticeable enough.</li>
            <li>Grape isn&#x27;t listed as a note, but it really does smell like a mix of raspberry and grape on me.</li>
            <li>It is one of my absolute favorites.</li>
            <li>Not only did i get my fav perfume for cheap.</li>
            <li>I really like the fragrance and do get compliments on it every time I wear it.</li>
            <li>i realized how much i like this scent</li>
            <li>IT HAS TO BE THE REAL DEAL BEACUSE</li>
            <li>I really like Britney Spears fragrances.</li>
            <li>that I can not believe how fast I get there</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much lighter than i remember, almost \\&quot;watered</li>
            <li>So refreshing and sweet with a small hint of floral.</li>
            <li>Not your typical sweet berry, instead a very fresh berry.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this perfume and the fact that it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>a light, fruity, flowery scent - which is what I prefer over the heavier musks and such...and a strange side effect has occurred from wearing it...</li>
            <li>Radiance has a really  fruity opening which is listed as \\&quot;wild berries\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>To me, it&#x27;s a perfect blend of light, airy citrusses and berries on a base of white florals.</li>
            <li>They always send me free samples of other perfumes!</li>
            <li>, i get many compliments on it and it lasts a long time unlike alot of other colognes, the scent lingers all day.</li>
            <li>In the heart, the pure white bouquet comes through, but it doesn&#x27;t smell too floral at all.</li>
            <li>One spray for sensitive wearers.</li>
            <li>I wanted to give a try to this perfume and so far I can tell that I am not dissapointed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 50+ year old mother of seven...</li>
            <li>I feel like a 13-year old girl.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s not heavy or overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells like it&#x27;s an old perfume.</li>
            <li>The smell was a little week compared to my original bottle</li>
            <li>its not over powering and has a very light subtle smell.</li>
            <li>A few hours in it turns soapy and clean, and towards the end of the day</li>
            <li>I recently bought Radiance and tried for the first time at the same time I bought Britney&#x27;s newest one, Cosmic Radiance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m normally very picky about perfume in general, and most celebrity perfumes smell awful and very generic, but this one smells so good and every time I wear it, people notice it</li>
            <li>Very floral, femenine and last enough on my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this perfume since it first came out 4 years ago, and I will not use any other perfume.</li>
            <li>and I wanted a large bottle so that it would last me a long time.</li>
            <li>Suitable mainly for younger women under 30 and casual wear.</li>
            <li>By mid-day, I can barely smell it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I thought it would wash off in the shower (something I was a bit sad about, honestly), but it actually got STRONGER.</li>

            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume a lot.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find it in the stores any more</li>
            <li> I should be purchasing something more sophisticated...</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so feminine and lovely.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what changed, but it&#x27;s a refreshing scent</li>
            <li> I love this scent</li>
            <li> Im in love with this... very very happy.smell so good</li>
            <li> , I recommend this perfume to girls from age 20 to adult 40 to 50 years, is sweet floral smells delicious!</li>
            <li> The first moment I sprayed it I loved it.</li>
            <li> Buy this if you must, but Cosmic Radiance deserves a Buy and enjoy:)</li>
            <li> bad movie pun and all, when my wife wears this, it smells awesome, its not for just teens, it actually is a very great perfume</li>
            <li> Not only did I find this item for a great price, but 3.3 ounces is a huge quantity!</li>
            <li> -(&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone who loves floral musky scents that last longer than many others, great deal for the price.</li>
            <li> It is strong yet not overpowering, unless of course you spray it 5 times.</li>
            <li> I will either end up giving this perfume away, strong perfumes bother me and&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It comes in a very pretty bottle as well!</li>
            <li> Huge bottle.</li>
            <li> My order came with free shipping and it arrived within three days of my purchase.</li>
            <li> Lol  idk  if im just a big baby....</li>
            <li> I have never seen pets appear to enjoy perfume.</li>
            <li> My wife and I both enjoy it.  </li>
            <li> Very nice scent and at a low price</li>
            <li> Very fresh</li>
            <li> Very light scent with a pretty bottle.</li>
            <li> It is strong and bold.</li>
            <li> I bought it based on all the great reviews of how long it lasts</li>
            <li> so i am sure a badass cougar would not agree ;)</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend if you love fruity sexy scents that are not to overpowering!</li>
            <li> It also transfers so well on my skin, it&#x27;s really true to what you smell in the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Really???!!</li>
            <li> It makes you feel fresh, pretty and clean.</li>
            <li> I just needed something cost effective for daily wear hence, this suited me well.</li>
            <li> Its not the fun fruity bubblegum smell that I am used too</li>
            <li> but a friend recommended this scent, and being the wild, adventurous woman that I am (or like to think that I am, anyway)</li>
            <li> Anyway, it is not very sophisticated but pleasant, a very nice scent as described in other reviews.</li>
            <li> &quot; It&#x27;s a very fresh Tuberose/Berry type of scent, very floral.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have tested most if not all of Britney&#x27;s line but this particular scent seems very grown up.</li>
            <li> (it smells like grapes too much) and prefer the original Radiance.</li>
            <li> This is a very radiant smelling scent, a pretty fruity floral which is more on the fruity side, and I honestly think it was marketed extremely well with the name.</li>
            <li> Tuberose has a very strong distinctive scent, so i would expect a fragrance with tuberose in it to last longer on the skin.</li>
            <li> , I thought it would be awesome as other Britney&#x27;s perfumes, however I noticed that smells a little bit light (for me).</li>
            <li> Ok first of all vendor was quick i received same week</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sweet, but a natural sweet.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and packaged very well.</li>
            <li> So yeah, make sure you really like it before ordering a bottle, because lasting power is extraordinary.</li>
            <li> The bottle is also beautiful with the blue and pink gemstones all around.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> First spray</li>
            <li> but  the lil extra bonuses the seller sent along with my perfume was heart touching  lol&lt;</li>
            <li> exact email</li>
            <li> so it does smell great and does last for a long time, all day, but not on all skin types :</li>
            <li> i love this,first smelled a sample of it at a local walmart and sprayed it on my sleeve, by the time i finished shopping</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t really last and the fragrance itself is not all that appealing.</li>
            <li> a funny thing happened...</li>
            <li> Yet gives a great long lasting scent!!</li>
            <li> Love this sweet and fresh perfume for everyday.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the extra goodies too :)</li>
            <li> When I first purchased this fragrance at Walgreens in 2011, I didn&#x27;t really like the smell.</li>
            <li> You can find it at pretty much every drug store, so it should be easy enough to find it in your town to try it.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too strong that it bothers people, but its noticeable enough.</li>
            <li> Grape isn&#x27;t listed as a note, but it really does smell like a mix of raspberry and grape on me.</li>
            <li> It is one of my absolute favorites.</li>
            <li> Not only did i get my fav perfume for cheap.</li>
            <li> I really like the fragrance and do get compliments on it every time I wear it.</li>
            <li> i realized how much i like this scent</li>
            <li> IT HAS TO BE THE REAL DEAL BEACUSE</li>
            <li> I really like Britney Spears fragrances.</li>
            <li> that I can not believe how fast I get there</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much lighter than i remember, almost \\&quot;watered</li>
            <li> So refreshing and sweet with a small hint of floral.</li>
            <li> Not your typical sweet berry, instead a very fresh berry.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this perfume and the fact that it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> a light, fruity, flowery scent - which is what I prefer over the heavier musks and such...and a strange side effect has occurred from wearing it...</li>
            <li> Radiance has a really  fruity opening which is listed as \\&quot;wild berries\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> To me, it&#x27;s a perfect blend of light, airy citrusses and berries on a base of white florals.</li>
            <li> They always send me free samples of other perfumes!</li>
            <li> , i get many compliments on it and it lasts a long time unlike alot of other colognes, the scent lingers all day.</li>
            <li> In the heart, the pure white bouquet comes through, but it doesn&#x27;t smell too floral at all.</li>
            <li> One spray for sensitive wearers.</li>
            <li> I wanted to give a try to this perfume and so far I can tell that I am not dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 50+ year old mother of seven...</li>
            <li> I feel like a 13-year old girl.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s not heavy or overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells like it&#x27;s an old perfume.</li>
            <li> The smell was a little week compared to my original bottle</li>
            <li> its not over powering and has a very light subtle smell.</li>
            <li> A few hours in it turns soapy and clean, and towards the end of the day</li>
            <li> I recently bought Radiance and tried for the first time at the same time I bought Britney&#x27;s newest one, Cosmic Radiance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m normally very picky about perfume in general, and most celebrity perfumes smell awful and very generic, but this one smells so good and every time I wear it, people notice it</li>
            <li> Very floral, femenine and last enough on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this perfume since it first came out 4 years ago, and I will not use any other perfume.</li>
            <li> and I wanted a large bottle so that it would last me a long time.</li>
            <li> Suitable mainly for younger women under 30 and casual wear.</li>
            <li> By mid-day, I can barely smell it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I thought it would wash off in the shower (something I was a bit sad about, honestly), but it actually got STRONGER.</li>
            <li> To me this is the smell of flirty success, for when I mean business, with floral notes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry but it just doesn&#x27;t smell like the original!</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> had my 12 year old daughter try it, she LOVES Brittneys other fragrances and on her it lasts all through school, P.E. and usual kid antics, when I pick her up from school</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a real fan of musk myself, but I don&#x27;t find it overly musky</li>
            <li> It only took a few days from the time I ordered it to the front door.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like other Britney fragrances</li>
            <li> It could be my body chemistry, but I&#x27;ve never had this problem with other Britney fragrances.</li>
            <li> I JUST KNEW I WASNT GOING TO BE LET DOWN BY THIS BRITTANY SPEARS FRAGRANCE. .</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday, anmd people give me compliments on it a lot.</li>
            <li> I use it about everyday</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a subtly layered fragrance, one that slightly changes as the day goes on.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very green, and reminds me a bit of Marc Jacob&#x27;s Daisy.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve hardly made a dent.</li>
            <li> But you also sent  samples of other perfumes, coupons!!!!</li>
            <li> I mean...</li>
            <li> seriously...</li>
            <li> im weird  </li>
            <li> when its gone ill be reordering!</li>
            <li> and i am a bit disappointed with the scent.</li>
            <li> then you will hate this.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The smell was a little week compared to my original bottle</li>
            <li> They delivered on time. I like it.</li>
            <li> Radiance is one of my Favorite Perfumes. Its fragrance is just so unique, its beautiful. I get 5+ compliments every time I wear Radiance.</li>
            <li> This was gift and she loved it</li>
            <li> I recently bought Radiance and tried for the first time at the same time I bought Britney&#x27;s newest one, Cosmic Radiance. I adore both of them. Radiance has a really  fruity opening which is listed as \\&quot;wild berries\\&quot;. I personally get a mix of raspberry and grape on my skin. Grape isn&#x27;t listed as a note, but it really does smell like a mix of raspberry and grape on me. In the heart, the pure white bouquet comes through, but it doesn&#x27;t smell too floral at all. You can definitely smell the musk in this, so if you&#x27;re not a fan of musk, keep that in mind. I&#x27;m not a real fan of musk myself, but I don&#x27;t find it overly musky, I can detect it for sure... but it&#x27;s mixed in with the amber.   This is a very radiant smelling scent, a pretty fruity floral which is more on the fruity side, and I honestly think it was marketed extremely well with the name. The bottle is also beautiful with the blue and pink gemstones all around.</li>
            <li> Radiance By Britney Spears Eau De Parfum Spray, 3.3-Fluid Ounce very good best for my wife and she love this product</li>
            <li> smells really good, kind of sweet.</li>
            <li> I love love thus perfume!!! &#x27;</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Wife loved it</li>
            <li> They were spot on while naming this fragrance, it truly is radiant. The first moment I sprayed it I loved it. In no way does this resemble a cheap perfume, it&#x27;s so beautifully blended. To me, it&#x27;s a perfect blend of light, airy citrusses and berries on a base of white florals. It&#x27;s sweet, but a natural sweet. It isn&#x27;t fake-sugary at all. It also transfers so well on my skin, it&#x27;s really true to what you smell in the bottle.  It&#x27;s also a subtly layered fragrance, one that slightly changes as the day goes on. First spray it&#x27;s refreshing, bright and floral. A few hours in it turns soapy and clean, and towards the end of the day it&#x27;s very green, and reminds me a bit of Marc Jacob&#x27;s Daisy. The florals are there all day, but it never gets cloying or headachy. It&#x27;s just blended so well. It makes you feel fresh, pretty and clean. It&#x27;s wonderful.  My favorite thing about Radiance? The lasting power! I sprayed it on my arm in Ulta, and it was actually still there two days later when I went back to buy the gift set. It didn&#x27;t go away. I thought it would wash off in the shower (something I was a bit sad about, honestly), but it actually got STRONGER. So yeah, make sure you really like it before ordering a bottle, because lasting power is extraordinary. You can find it at pretty much every drug store, so it should be easy enough to find it in your town to try it.  Yeah, Radiance is amazing. One of my all-time favorites. I can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
            <li> bad movie pun and all, when my wife wears this, it smells awesome, its not for just teens, it actually is a very great perfume</li>
            <li> Exquisite perfume! Lasts all day! I recommend it!</li>

            <li> excellent product very good quality I am completely satisfied. thanks for good products sell very good quality, please do not hesitate to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I like it!! The perfume got in time and in perfect conditions. About the perfume, it is Ok, I thought it would be awesome as other Britney&#x27;s perfumes, however I noticed that smells a little bit light (for me). It delicious, but if you like to wear all they your perfume, you should spray it several times...</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume by Britney!! The price is wonderful, and I love the company that I buy from! They always send me free samples of other perfumes! Great product!!</li>
            <li> I just needed something cost effective for daily wear hence, this suited me well. I&#x27;ll buy it again if I don&#x27;t get something else for this price.</li>

            <li> My girlfriend and I like it alot. Excellent deal for the amount of perfume you get. I have a feeling I will have to order it again...&lt;br /&gt;THANKS AGAIN AMAZON .....</li>
            <li> I love this fragance. I&#x27; ve bought it before and receive a lot of compliments for it.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have tested most if not all of Britney&#x27;s line but this particular scent seems very grown up. Its not the fun fruity bubblegum smell that I am used too so it will take time for me to adjust. It&#x27;s much more floral and sexy. good for the 21+ crowd.</li>
            <li> I love this scent it stays on me for 24 hrs....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Britney! Love her! Ok, so this perfume is super delicious but try Cosmic Radiance the newer one. It&#x27;s better, scouts honor. I wear it everyday, anmd people give me compliments on it a lot.Buy this if you must, but Cosmic Radiance deserves a Buy and enjoy:)</li>
            <li> I really like the fragrance and do get compliments on it every time I wear it. I bought it based on all the great reviews of how long it lasts, I guess it&#x27;s me because it doesn&#x27;t last on my skin at all. By mid-day, I can barely smell it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I had my 12 year old daughter try it, she LOVES Brittneys other fragrances and on her it lasts all through school, P.E. and usual kid antics, when I pick her up from school, she still smells great so it does smell great and does last for a long time, all day, but not on all skin types :-(&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone who loves floral musky scents that last longer than many others, great deal for the price.</li>
            <li> Im in love with this... very very happy.smell so good</li>
            <li> i love this,first smelled a sample of it at a local walmart and sprayed it on my sleeve, by the time i finished shopping i realized how much i like this scent so i went back to get a bottle but i guess i didnt look before because they only had the tester and no actual bottles of it so i came to amazon and ordered a 3oz. bottle and i love it, i get many compliments on it and it lasts a long time unlike alot of other colognes, the scent lingers all day. its not over powering and has a very light subtle smell. when its gone ill be reordering!</li>
            <li> Ok first of all vendor was quick i received same week i order now product i love it im 30 i tought it was going to be a different smell but it smells good its good for all ages</li>
            <li> I JUST KNEW I WASNT GOING TO BE LET DOWN BY THIS BRITTANY SPEARS FRAGRANCE. . SMELLS WONDERFUL. . IT HAS TO BE THE REAL DEAL BEACUSE THE SCENT LASTS ON ME ALL DAY, EVEN ON MY CLOTHES...I SOOOO HEART IT!!!!</li>
            <li> Huge bottle. Smells so nice. Should last me quite a while!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes. Very light scent with a pretty bottle. I have the smaller size that I carry in my purse to freshen up with throughout the day. I wish this scent lasted longer.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my daughter for Christmas. She loved it. It did smell wonderful and how beautifully the bottle is designed</li>
            <li> I love this scent. It is strong yet not overpowering, unless of course you spray it 5 times. you really only need 2, MAYBE 3 sprays. One spray for sensitive wearers. To me this is the smell of flirty success, for when I mean business, with floral notes. It is strong and bold. I am 24 though so i am sure a badass cougar would not agree ;) it works great for me though!!</li>
            <li> Love! My signature fragrance</li>
            <li> Delivery was on time and the package was perfectly intact. Thanks for the extra goodies too :)</li>
            <li> I think Britney has very good fragances. I love the bottle and concept for her Fantasy Twist. I wanted to give a try to this perfume and so far I can tell that I am not dissapointed. Very floral, femenine and last enough on my skin.</li>
            <li> I will either end up giving this perfume away, strong perfumes bother me and&lt;br /&gt;I bought this before I had asthma, but Britney&#x27;s perfumes are good but remember&lt;br /&gt;less worn is best.</li>
            <li> Love it! Also fantasy is another amazing perfume!</li>
            <li> Very nice scent and at a low price, this was a perfect gift to myself this season. Very pleased with the product, and I LOVE the bottle it comes in</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and packaged very well. The wife loves this fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry but it just doesn&#x27;t smell like the original!</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t really last and the fragrance itself is not all that appealing.</li>
            <li> I opened up the rollerball that I bought as a tester and the kittens came running over to smell this fruity/musky delight. I have never seen pets appear to enjoy perfume. Anyway, it is not very sophisticated but pleasant, a very nice scent as described in other reviews. Suitable mainly for younger women under 30 and casual wear. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume a lot. I&#x27;m picky about perfumes and this one is amazing. So refreshing and sweet with a small hint of floral. I don&#x27;t like other Britney fragrances but this one is awesome!</li>
            <li> This smelled amazing! thank you</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find it in the stores any more and it&#x27;s my favorite scent!!</li>
            <li> Very nice fragrance and good bargain for the price.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this perfume and the fact that it lasts a long time.  It comes in a very pretty bottle as well!</li>
            <li> Smells great. My wife and I both enjoy it.  Good price too. It only took a few days from the time I ordered it to the front door.</li>
            <li> I was prepared to not like this perfume. I mean...seriously...I&#x27;m a 50+ year old mother of seven...and I&#x27;m buying a perfume put out by BRITNEY SPEARS??!! I should be purchasing something more sophisticated...like Chanel or Dior...heck, I&#x27;d even take a Jennifer Lopez perfume at this point...but a friend recommended this scent, and being the wild, adventurous woman that I am (or like to think that I am, anyway), I figured I would give it a try. Heck - if I didn&#x27;t like it - I&#x27;d pawn it off on my teenage daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a funny thing happened...I actually ended up LIKING the scent. And lo and behold - I started receiving compliments from others when I wore this scent. Wha??!! Really???!! When asked what I was wearing, I was almost embarrassed to tell them it was a Britney Spears perfume - but then I thought, &amp;#34;Why be embarrassed? I&#x27;m going to OWN this scent.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a light, fruity, flowery scent - which is what I prefer over the heavier musks and such...and a strange side effect has occurred from wearing it...I notice that when I DO wear it...I feel like a 13-year old girl. All over again. I guess I am...&amp;#34;radiant.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My favorite scent from Britney!</li>
            <li> bought this perfume for my wife and she loved it the price was great so im very pleased with this purchase</li>
            <li> Daughter was very happy with this gift wants another.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a perfume FIEND. I really like Britney Spears fragrances. They&#x27;re so feminine and lovely. Plus the bottle is gorgeous!</li>
            <li> este perfume es para mi madre, a las dos nos encantan los perfumes de britney son tan frescos y suaves</li>
            <li> you to buy perfumes Brithney because I really like but this is the best, I get super fast in perfect condition, I think it is the best perfume has an extensive durability and is nice to everyone, what I like most is its besides price that I can not believe how fast I get there, I recommend this perfume to girls from age 20 to adult 40 to 50 years, is sweet floral smells delicious!</li>
            <li> Love this sweet and fresh perfume for everyday. Very fresh and I get tons of compliments.  Any time someone asks about it, I turn my head dramatically and say &amp;#34; it&#x27;s Britney, bitch&amp;#34; just kidding, maybe.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this perfume since it first came out 4 years ago, and I will not use any other perfume. I&#x27;m normally very picky about perfume in general, and most celebrity perfumes smell awful and very generic, but this one smells so good and every time I wear it, people notice it and they compliment the scent. It isn&#x27;t too strong that it bothers people, but its noticeable enough. I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores, so I ordered it online after my 2nd bottle ran out and I&#x27;m still very pleased.</li>
            <li> All britneys perfume rock, BUY IT!!!</li>
            <li> Producto en excelente estado, lo recomiendo amplia mente, yo vivo en Venezuela y el producto me llego en muy buen estado</li>
            <li> smells good on almost everyone, more than you&#x27;d think</li>
            <li> When I first purchased this fragrance at Walgreens in 2011, I didn&#x27;t really like the smell. I bought it because it was a Britney product, and I like to support Britney! However, I grew to like it, and in 2013, I bought the largest bottle. I LOVE it now! I don&#x27;t know what changed, but it&#x27;s a refreshing scent that&#x27;s not heavy or overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it doesn&#x27;t last long. I have to apply it several times, and even then the scent won&#x27;t stay. It could be my body chemistry, but I&#x27;ve never had this problem with other Britney fragrances. I have about 25% left in my current bottle and will definitely buy again once it&#x27;s out. I don&#x27;t like Cosmic Radiance (it smells like grapes too much) and prefer the original Radiance. I&#x27;d give it more stars if I could!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, I think I smelled this fragrance before with another name, but no matter,I really love it!</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this product and I wanted a large bottle so that it would last me a long time. I&#x27;ve had it now for about a month I use it about everyday but I&#x27;ve hardly made a dent.</li>
            <li> buena venta, recomendado 100%. entraga rapida y segura</li>
            <li> It smells like it&#x27;s an old perfume. My sister has it and it doesn&#x27;t smell like hers...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve have been wanting to buy this for the longest time! Not only did I find this item for a great price, but 3.3 ounces is a huge quantity! I&#x27;ve already gotten so many compliments on it and it not overpowering! Would definitely recommend if you love fruity sexy scents that are not to overpowering!</li>
            <li> I loved this perfume when i tested it when it very first came out. I bought it here on Amazon and i am a bit disappointed with the scent. It&#x27;s much lighter than i remember, almost \\&quot;watered down.\\&quot; It&#x27;s a very fresh Tuberose/Berry type of scent, very floral.Tuberose has a very strong distinctive scent, so i would expect a fragrance with tuberose in it to last longer on the skin. If you don&#x27;t like the scent of tuberose.. then you will hate this. To my nose, i get about 85% Tuberose and 15% Berry. Not your typical sweet berry, instead a very fresh berry.</li>
            <li> Great suddle perfume!! I love this scent it&#x27;s not overpowering.. Yet gives a great long lasting scent!!</li>
