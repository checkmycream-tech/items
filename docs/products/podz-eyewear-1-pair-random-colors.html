    <ol>
            <li>so they suctioned onto your eye lids, then this product would be perfect.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re Eye Podz LOL!</li>
            <li>Love it!!!</li>
            <li>Now i just keep it in my bag instead of on my keys which would have been ideal.</li>
            <li>But, for the price a good buy!</li>
            <li>Great way to keep eye protection with you.</li>
            <li>Another great thing, no tan lines</li>
            <li>the kind you get at walmart in a pack of like 30-50 for a dollar or two...</li>
            <li>so honestly i sit and text in the tanning bed</li>
            <li>yeah, aside from all that i liked the product alot :)</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure they will work fine in a bed</li>
            <li>I loved these, very convienent....</li>
            <li>came very quickly in the mail, as described, works just fine and stays put in the container.</li>
            <li>I got blue which I am happy with.</li>
            <li>they get the job done, nothing special about them.  </li>
            <li>I bought a pair of \\&quot;winkies\\&quot; and put them in the hard case to elongate their life since they do seem to work the best to avoid unsightly tan lines.  </li>
            <li>This product is great for minimal tan line.</li>
            <li>For the price and quick delivery though they&#x27;re worth it.</li>
            <li>Good for a limited tan line around your eyes and nose area because you can move them around individually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fans in the bed blew the pods right off my eyes.  </li>
            <li>You can move at all or they fall right off.</li>
            <li>case lid does not stay fully shut now after first use.</li>
            <li>other than that I love the keychain feature!</li>
            <li>it worked :)     aside from the case not closing (and the fact that i order two sets, was billed and payed for two sets, but only recieved 1 set...</li>
            <li>I love the lil&#x27; key chain feature I snap it on my tanning bag and go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The ONLY plus is the cute case.</li>
            <li>cause i can see through them a heck of a lot better than the standard goggles with just the pin hole.   </li>
            <li>With these ones, they are little disks that pop out of the case that go right over your eyes kind of like the wink</li>
            <li>Easy to open and use, wish I could have picked the color of the case though.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t realize they are in the LARGE box (which get thrown in a dumpster).  </li>
            <li>I REALLY can&#x27;t since I never saw it</li>
            <li>, everyone including me always seems to think that you are getting tan lines with the standard cheap tanning goggle you can find basically anywhere</li>
            <li>I like to use this for lay down beds, they are more comfortable than regular goggles.</li>
            <li>They are ok if you are going to tan on your back only, but who does that?</li>
            <li>Also, I tan in a high pressure bed.  </li>
            <li>only problem is the thing that makes them most convienent (the keychain case) is extremely defective.</li>
            <li>The case is small, fits nicely on a keychain next to my gym tag.  </li>
            <li>Great concept, except the case is extremely difficult to open</li>
            <li>I would also prefer to be able to pick my color, or at least a preference.</li>
            <li>and I really like them thank god they sent me blue</li>
            <li>I was happily surprised to see them on my doorstep on the 13th!</li>
            <li>So the negative is, since they aren&#x27;t stickers, so if the fans in the tanning bed are really strong, or its a stand up, so i&#x27;d have a set of back up goggles if you do those since these probably wont stay on.</li>
            <li>they are a bit large for my eyes and the edges don&#x27;t seem too smooth and are a bit uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li>These are great little goggle to have on your key chain, the thing that i hate is the case isn&#x27;t very well designed</li>

            <li> First of all, I know it says that color will vary, but I simply put a request to get purple, pink, or green.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this yet due to inability to open the container without some sort of tool.</li>
            <li> i got around this by taking one of my really small clear elastic hair pony tail holders...</li>
            <li> I like the fact that they are small and do their job, but also they are completely see through,</li>
            <li> I am constantly afraid that eye pieces are going to fall out and get lost, but they haven&#x27;t yet because they do fit snugly in the case.</li>
            <li> and i used that as a rubber band to keep the case closed...</li>
            <li> so i always need to carry around a rubber band, wrapped around it to keep it closed.  </li>
            <li> Pretty much useless if you wanted to put these on your keychain...</li>
            <li> for when Amazon packs them with a bunch of other stuff</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any other eyewear with me</li>
            <li> whatever), the \\&quot;goggles\\&quot; themselves are individual black hard plastic winkie type things - I haven&#x27;t tried them yet</li>
            <li> so i saw these and ordered thinking they were a set of goggles that folded in half....</li>
            <li> I tan after working out and hate carrying around eye wear (not to mention the lines you get from using goggles), and the \\&quot;winkies\\&quot; seem like a huge rip off at $1 a pair.  </li>
            <li> I tan at the gym and usually go in with my car keys and water, nothing else.  </li>
            <li> Wish they made rubber cups instead of the hard plastic</li>
            <li> They certainly are worthless for using at the pool or beach, inasmuch as they are not secured to your face in any way.</li>
            <li> so they&#x27;re no good for the stand up bed at my gym</li>
            <li> You get a random color hard container and one pair of hard, plastic cups to put over your eyes.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when I received my Podz eyewear and used them, or tried to use them for the first time.  </li>
            <li> I was getting tired of covering my raccoon eyes with makeup.</li>
            <li> Arrives in a random color.</li>
            <li> Besides that part they aren&#x27;t bad at all.  </li>
            <li> Closure mechanism is just stupid.</li>
            <li> These are worthless.</li>
            <li> Very terrible product.</li>

            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this yet due to inability to open the container without some sort of tool. I have no plans on taking a toolkit to the tanning bed.  I would also prefer to be able to pick my color, or at least a preference.</li>
            <li> You get a random color hard container and one pair of hard, plastic cups to put over your eyes.  These are definitely not meant for a booth, and if you move in the bed, they will fall off.  I use a booth, but ordered this product for the container.  I tan at the gym and usually go in with my car keys and water, nothing else.  I tan after working out and hate carrying around eye wear (not to mention the lines you get from using goggles), and the \\&quot;winkies\\&quot; seem like a huge rip off at $1 a pair.  I bought a pair of \\&quot;winkies\\&quot; and put them in the hard case to elongate their life since they do seem to work the best to avoid unsightly tan lines.  The case is small, fits nicely on a keychain next to my gym tag.  Wish they made rubber cups instead of the hard plastic so they suctioned onto your eye lids, then this product would be perfect.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I was getting tired of covering my raccoon eyes with makeup. This product is great for minimal tan line. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Wish the goggles would stay inside the case. Closure mechanism is just stupid. Pretty much useless if you wanted to put these on your keychain...but alright for a purse.</li>
            <li> Arrives in a random color. I got blue which I am happy with. Case includes two eye cups for lay-down tanning. I like the fact that it comes with a key chain attachment so that way i never forget them when i go to the tanning salon. However there is one drawback: case lid does not stay fully shut now after first use. I am constantly afraid that eye pieces are going to fall out and get lost, but they haven&#x27;t yet because they do fit snugly in the case.</li>
            <li> they get the job done, nothing special about them.  I took off one star b/c they are a bit large for my eyes and the edges don&#x27;t seem too smooth and are a bit uncomfortable.  But, for the price a good buy!</li>
            <li> I have not found in the description where it says the amount you get i assumed you get 6 but you only get one. I also didnt get to choose my color. I got red. other than that I love the keychain feature!</li>
            <li> came very quickly in the mail, as described, works just fine and stays put in the container.</li>
            <li> Easy to open and use, wish I could have picked the color of the case though. I look forward to using them soon.</li>
            <li> I like to use this for lay down beds, they are more comfortable than regular goggles. I would not recommend these for a stand up bed though.</li>
            <li> Great way to keep eye protection with you.</li>
            <li> I needed goggles for the tanning bed at my gym... so i saw these and ordered thinking they were a set of goggles that folded in half.... Instead they are just the two uv blocking pieces made to lay over your eyes while tanning. so they&#x27;re no good for the stand up bed at my gym</li>
            <li> I loved these, very convienent.... only problem is the thing that makes them most convienent (the keychain case) is extremely defective. the case won&#x27;t stay shut!!! i got around this by taking one of my really small clear elastic hair pony tail holders... the kind you get at walmart in a pack of like 30-50 for a dollar or two... and i used that as a rubber band to keep the case closed... it worked :)     aside from the case not closing (and the fact that i order two sets, was billed and payed for two sets, but only recieved 1 set... oh and also I didn&#x27;t get to choose the color I wanted) yeah, aside from all that i liked the product alot :)</li>
            <li> I love the lil&#x27; key chain feature I snap it on my tanning bag and go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how the eye wear pops out of the case and rest effortlessly on your eyes.  Good for a limited tan line around your eyes and nose area because you can move them around individually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only set back is you have to hold both of them if you are laying on your side or tummy. They&#x27;re Eye Podz LOL!</li>
            <li> for when Amazon packs them with a bunch of other stuff and you don&#x27;t realize they are in the LARGE box (which get thrown in a dumpster).  I ordered a different type of shades BY itself.  Should get it today!  AMAZON is making me rate the product.......I REALLY can&#x27;t since I never saw it so 3 stars I guess.........</li>
            <li> Great concept, except the case is extremely difficult to open (I had to use a credit card everytime), then the case broke after a week. and the eye podz slip off your eyes sometimes (or atleast they feel like it). Now i just keep it in my bag instead of on my keys which would have been ideal.</li>
            <li> I like them they were on time and I really like them thank god they sent me blue I&#x27;m a guy and was assorted color order which they need to change soon</li>
            <li> I ordered these on Sept 9 with standard shipping and Amazon informed me they would arrive between the 15th and 20th... I was happily surprised to see them on my doorstep on the 13th! Only issues are that you can&#x27;t pick the color of the case (I got blue, probably my last choice but whatever), the \\&quot;goggles\\&quot; themselves are individual black hard plastic winkie type things - I haven&#x27;t tried them yet but I&#x27;m sure they will work fine in a bed (definitely won&#x27;t work in a stand up booth), and the case doesn&#x27;t stay shut so I can&#x27;t attach it to the zipper of my gym bag like I was hoping to.  For the price and quick delivery though they&#x27;re worth it.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when I received my Podz eyewear and used them, or tried to use them for the first time.  First of all, I know it says that color will vary, but I simply put a request to get purple, pink, or green. Of course, I got orange (not a color I wanted).  Also, I tan in a high pressure bed.  The fans in the bed blew the pods right off my eyes.  I didn&#x27;t have any other eyewear with me so I had to HOLD them on my face while I tanned.  Very terrible product. The ONLY plus is the cute case.</li>
            <li> These are great little goggle to have on your key chain, the thing that i hate is the case isn&#x27;t very well designed so i always need to carry around a rubber band, wrapped around it to keep it closed.  Besides that part they aren&#x27;t bad at all.  I like the fact that they are small and do their job, but also they are completely see through, so honestly i sit and text in the tanning bed cause i can see through them a heck of a lot better than the standard goggles with just the pin hole.   Another great thing, no tan lines, everyone including me always seems to think that you are getting tan lines with the standard cheap tanning goggle you can find basically anywhere, heck i always felt like i had raccoon eyes with those things.  With these ones, they are little disks that pop out of the case that go right over your eyes kind of like the wink ease sticker ones! but plastic discs.  So the negative is, since they aren&#x27;t stickers, so if the fans in the tanning bed are really strong, or its a stand up, so i&#x27;d have a set of back up goggles if you do those since these probably wont stay on.</li>
            <li> These are worthless. I thought that they unfolded and then had an elastic band. They are ok if you are going to tan on your back only, but who does that? You can move at all or they fall right off.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what they were thinking when designing this product.  I suppose they figured you would simply not move at all.  Perhaps they are just for tanning beds?  They certainly are worthless for using at the pool or beach, inasmuch as they are not secured to your face in any way.</li>
