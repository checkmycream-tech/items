            <li>This is pricier than most shampoos, but it&#x27;s alright.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;normal to dry&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t clean my scalp as well as the &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; (the &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; cleans my scalp and leaves it feeling refreshed), and the &amp;#34;normal to dry&amp;#34; works nicely on the ends of my hair (the &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>but if you like to skip a day or two in between washes it may be a better fit.  </li>

            <li>The only really good thing about it is that it is 32 oz, which for it&#x27;s price on Amazon, is a lot.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, did not do much about oily hair after many hair wash.</li>
            <li>no bad odor either.</li>
            <li>If your loosing hair or have bold spots this shampoo will really help you guys out as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Making my hair thicker, making it grow, shinny and makes it look fresh almost new like its none damaged from hair straightening hair.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this shampoo</li>
            <li>I keep looking for a miracle that really isn&#x27;t out there</li>

            <li>i think it take oil out maybe a bit to much</li>
            <li>Hopefully other users are having more luck.</li>
            <li>hair is long and fine.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive scalp that isn&#x27;t that flaky, but was having problems with severe itching and huge splotches of red after washing my hair (allergic reaction of some sort)...</li>
            <li>I highly recommened it to all</li>
            <li>help me to clear up itchy scalp that breaks out now during menapause.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve experienced an allergic reaction to using this shampoo; my scalp broke out in itchy red splotches all over - extremely bad itching.  </li>
            <li>(it does NOT smell like onions, but it&#x27;s still not good), and it did dry out my hair a bit, even though as I alluded, my hair became greasy at the roots very quickly again.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I really wanted to like this shampoo but it did nothing for my oily hair . I will not recommend this product if you have severe oily hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is still extremely oily, so doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> Wish I could have used this shampoo.  I received a shampoo soaked box with an empty bottle inside.  I was ready love this shampoo but I guess it didn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m cursed with ridiculously oily hair,  wash it once to twice a day all my life, I&#x27;m 57. I keep looking for a miracle that really isn&#x27;t out there but this comes the closest after trying tons of products.</li>
            <li> It does not work on oily hair at all</li>
            <li> I think the Shampoo works really well however; it does not smell so good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Making my hair thicker, making it grow, shinny and makes it look fresh almost new like its none damaged from hair straightening hair. I love this shampoo!!!! If your loosing hair or have bold spots this shampoo will really help you guys out as well. I would recommend this to the world. It&#x27;s a must try!</li>
            <li> This product really helps with hair loss.  If you have thinning hair it is worth a try plus it makes your hair shiny and beautiful.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t help out with my greasy hair at all. It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t smell very good (it does NOT smell like onions, but it&#x27;s still not good), and it did dry out my hair a bit, even though as I alluded, my hair became greasy at the roots very quickly again. The only really good thing about it is that it is 32 oz, which for it&#x27;s price on Amazon, is a lot.</li>
            <li> Good smell. Otherwise, did not do much about oily hair after many hair wash. No change at all. Will use it for a bit longer just to make sure</li>
            <li> Worked well for first couple of weeks but soon began to make my scalp itchy so started using it in combination with an other shampoo by alternating brands every other wash. It is a little harsh so I would not recommend this shampoo to someone who washes their hair daily but if you like to skip a day or two in between washes it may be a better fit.  Works well at keeping hair less oily and adds body if you blowdry scalp. There are sulfates in it but also includes natural ingredients like unscented garlic extract.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is long and fine.</li>
            <li> help me to clear up itchy scalp that breaks out now during menapause. This is pricier than most shampoos, but it&#x27;s alright. no bad odor either.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It made my hair thick and shiny. Smells good too! I highly recommened it to all</li>
            <li> This  is really good for oily hair but It hasn&#x27;t helped my hair grow it actually feels thinner i think it take oil out maybe a bit to much</li>
            <li> I originally purchased both Nora Ross &amp;#34;normal to dry&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; shampoos because I wasn&#x27;t sure which one would work best.  I have a very sensitive scalp that isn&#x27;t that flaky, but was having problems with severe itching and huge splotches of red after washing my hair (allergic reaction of some sort)...I needed something that would soothe my scalp not inflame it.  So, after doing some research, I came across the Nora Ross brand, and after reading lots of reviews, I decided to give it a try.  The &amp;#34;normal to dry&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t clean my scalp as well as the &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; (the &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; cleans my scalp and leaves it feeling refreshed), and the &amp;#34;normal to dry&amp;#34; works nicely on the ends of my hair (the &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; variety dries my hair ends).  Overall, I love the product, and I&#x27;m so happy I found it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update May 8, 2015:  I&#x27;ve experienced an allergic reaction to using this shampoo; my scalp broke out in itchy red splotches all over - extremely bad itching.  I&#x27;m not sure why the later reaction, but I&#x27;ve stopped using the product.  Very disappointed.  Hopefully other users are having more luck.</li>
            <li> Excellent for oily hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a difference</li>
