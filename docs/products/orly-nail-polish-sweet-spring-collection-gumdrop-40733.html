            <li>It felt perfect for summertime, and I even got a compliment on it the first day I wore it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First off, the color, Gumdrop, is gorgeous!!</li>
            <li>It makes for an easy grip and great control.</li>
            <li>Its more of a bright blueish teal.</li>
            <li>The brush is just amazing as well.</li>
            <li>Really nice shade of turquoise.</li>
            <li>So glad I was able to re purchase!</li>
            <li>a glossy top coat to it</li>
            <li>Color is more muted than shown.  </li>
            <li>I get many compliments when I wear it</li>
            <li>probably because I do more activities with my hands.</li>
            <li>The color of Gumdrop is lovely-</li>
            <li>so i just opted for what seemed like next best thing.</li>
            <li>Application is smooth, and dries to a nice satin like finish.</li>
            <li>Once Again Thanks for the great service.</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend this color to a friend.</li>
            <li>It goes on beautifully, but does not last even 48 hours!</li>
            <li>On my toes it stays nicely but on my fingers they chip quite fast..</li>
            <li>It also did not go on 100% smoothly, and seemed to be a bit thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this shade but it chipped pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>My addiction this color is bright enough to be neutral</li>
            <li>I already bought this polish last year, the color is gorgeous.</li>
            <li>A very pretty color.  </li>
            <li>After buying this polish, Orly is my new favorite brand.</li>
            <li>The first coat went on fairly streak-free and was almost opaque enough to get away with just one coat, something I rarely find.  </li>
            <li>you are looking for a pretty, springtime/summery color, I would recommend Gumdrop.  </li>
            <li>I purchased Orly polish for the first time.</li>
            <li>so I had to use 3 coats, but the finish was real</li>
            <li>/&gt;Stays on very well.</li>
            <li>i really wanted ancient jade</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very soothing color.</li>
            <li>LOOKS MUCH MUCH NICER IN THE PICTURE</li>
            <li>Plan to buy more when bottle is empty.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to try out mint colored nail polish and purchased this thinking</li>
            <li>You only need a couple coats to have a rich finish.</li>
            <li>The color is nice, and it goes on your nail more or less smooth,  but it takes hours to get it dry, I used it once, and was very careful, but had to wipe it off, because it all smudged before it dried up, so I am not even sure if it ever dries.</li>
            <li>Goes on solidly in two coats, dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty alone or as a French manicure.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very sweet almost turquoise green.</li>
            <li>The color goes on smoothly and is long lasting.</li>
            <li>took off a star because it chipped within the first 24 hours, and I had cut my nails rather short before applying the polish, so it was not due to my nails hitting things.  </li>
            <li>a minty turquoise that is completely opaque and void of glitter.  </li>
            <li>It dried in a reasonable amount of time, and the second coat also went on fairly smoothly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This was my first time using Orly, and I found the applicator pleasant to use and grip, although I was disappointed Orly has the more common blunt brush instead of the curved brush I prefer.  </li>
            <li>This product arrived very fast and as expected.</li>
            <li>And a quick tip: don&#x27;t skip out on the base coat and top coat.</li>
            <li>Stays on well, isn&#x27;t too thick, and looks exactly how it&#x27;s pictured!</li>

            <li> The polish is thick, so you only really need once coat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will certainly try other Orly polishes again, and I will likely wear this polish again soon, at least on my toes where I can pretend I am at the beach, standing in turquoise water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it does not stay as long as other polishes do.</li>
            <li> It did catch a few times, forcing me to go back and touch up the missed area and then apply an additional coat to hide the mistakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little stiff and can leave a line texture in the laquer if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> Thick draggy not sure if its old stock or what</li>
            <li> I used the base coat, 2 coats of color and a top coat.</li>
            <li> Ended up being slightly darker than pictured</li>
            <li> I will go back to the less expensive brands that last longer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not talking a little chip either.</li>
            <li> it was close to that pastel type of green color.</li>
            <li> After moving this year, my old bottle was lost :(.</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> and my nails are horrible.</li>

            <li> This color is awesome, you won&#x27;t find any like it. It&#x27;s a very sweet almost turquoise green. I have had a lot of compliments on it.&lt;br /&gt;The application was a bit streaky so I had to use 3 coats, but the finish was real good.&lt;br /&gt;Add a glossy top coat to it and it looks like a jelly bean on your hand!</li>
            <li> Color is more muted than shown.  Very pretty alone or as a French manicure.</li>
            <li> The color is nice, and it goes on your nail more or less smooth,  but it takes hours to get it dry, I used it once, and was very careful, but had to wipe it off, because it all smudged before it dried up, so I am not even sure if it ever dries. I, probably, will not use it again.</li>
            <li> Purchased this a while ago but I still love it! I get many compliments when I wear it and it goes well with my tan complexion!</li>
            <li> Really nice shade of turquoise. Ended up being slightly darker than pictured online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stays on very well. No complaints at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so in love with this color, amazing!</li>
            <li> This nail polish goes on beautifully. But it does not stay as long as other polishes do. On my toes it stays nicely but on my fingers they chip quite fast..probably because I do more activities with my hands. But still..</li>
            <li> The color of Gumdrop is lovely- a minty turquoise that is completely opaque and void of glitter.  It felt perfect for summertime, and I even got a compliment on it the first day I wore it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first time using Orly, and I found the applicator pleasant to use and grip, although I was disappointed Orly has the more common blunt brush instead of the curved brush I prefer.  The first coat went on fairly streak-free and was almost opaque enough to get away with just one coat, something I rarely find.  It dried in a reasonable amount of time, and the second coat also went on fairly smoothly.

It also did not go on 100% smoothly, and seemed to be a bit thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will certainly try other Orly polishes again, and I will likely wear this polish again soon, at least on my toes where I can pretend I am at the beach, standing in turquoise water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a pretty, springtime/summery color, I would recommend Gumdrop.  Just be mindful as you apply it.</li>
            <li> i really wanted ancient jade but it seems like i cant find it anywhere so i just opted for what seemed like next best thing.</li>
            <li> I adore this color!  It looks gorgeous on and the application is awesome (2 coats)!!!  Perfect for the Spring and Summer months!!!  But, I will wear this anytime!</li>
            <li> About to order another bottle!!!! This color is awesome!!!!!!! Holy Moly!!!!!!! Nails look like turquoise gems!!!!!!!!! Beautiful even for fall/winter!!!!!!! Deep, juicy color!!!!!!!!! Perfection!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I got this as a spring color, and it is beautiful. It&#x27;s a very soothing color. The polish is thick, so you only really need once coat. And a quick tip: don&#x27;t skip out on the base coat and top coat. It makes a world of difference, especially with this color.</li>
            <li> Although, I have not yet recieved my package I know I will love this !! I already bought this polish last year, the color is gorgeous. Application is smooth, and dries to a nice satin like finish. After moving this year, my old bottle was lost :(. So glad I was able to re purchase!</li>
            <li> A very pretty color.  Goes on solidly in two coats, dries quickly.  My only qualm is with the brush.  It&#x27;s a little stiff and can leave a line texture in the laquer if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> This product arrived very fast and as expected. The color is great and has wonderful staying power. You only need a couple coats to have a rich finish.</li>
            <li> Very nice summer color looks good on me I would recommend and also buy this product again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Stays on well, isn&#x27;t too thick, and looks exactly how it&#x27;s pictured! I would strongly recommend this color to a friend.</li>
            <li> Love the way it looks!!</li>
            <li> My addiction this color is bright enough to be neutral</li>
            <li> LOOKS MUCH MUCH NICER IN THE PICTURE</li>
            <li> Horrible. Thick draggy not sure if its old stock or what but I know what I&#x27;m doing and my nails are horrible. Will stick with Ulta.</li>
            <li> I purchased Orly polish for the first time. It goes on beautifully, but does not last even 48 hours! I&#x27;m not talking a little chip either. It peels up in sections! I used the base coat, 2 coats of color and a top coat. I will go back to the less expensive brands that last longer!</li>
            <li> I wear turquoise jewelry at times and this is my go to color to make my jewelry/outfit pop.  The color goes on smoothly and is long lasting. Color looks great on the toes with a pair of \\&quot;kick ass\\&quot; open toe shoes...flats or heels. I will definitely buy again. This color is a keeper!</li>
            <li> Color of gumdrop is absolutely gorgeous. Shade is good for all skin tones. Plan to buy more when bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to try out mint colored nail polish and purchased this thinking it was close to that pastel type of green color. Its more of a bright blueish teal.</li>
            <li> I love this shade but it chipped pretty quickly. 2 coats were needed and it lasted about 2-3 days before I had to do touch ups.</li>
            <li> Once Again Thanks for the great service. I look forward to doing business again. the selection is great ! have a great day !</li>
            <li> After buying this polish, Orly is my new favorite brand. First off, the color, Gumdrop, is gorgeous!! Secondly, this is a BIG bottle! You get a lot of polish in this thing. Also, the handle is rubberized!! RUBBERIZED!! It makes for an easy grip and great control. The brush is just amazing as well. WELL DONE ORLY! This stuff is amazing!</li>
