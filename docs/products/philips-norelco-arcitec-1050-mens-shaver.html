    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>&quot; but Amazon was best.  </li>
            <li>Of the \\&quot;three discs\\&quot; type shavers, I think this one is the best because of the way the head articulates.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve always been impressed with Philips quality.</li>
            <li>I have been a longtime user of electric shavers, having settled on Norelco as providing the best for my needs.</li>
            <li>It looks like it can just slip-slide across your chin and neck with the greatest of ease.</li>
            <li>I still cannot get the best shave over the area between my mouth and my chin...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy I made the decision to go with this product.  </li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s the best shaver I have ever had, I  would recommend it highley.</li>
            <li>This shaver gives me the best shave for an electric shaver I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Is it perfect?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for over 25 years, and while this one isn&#x27;t the best I&#x27;ve owned, it is close.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great!  </li>
            <li>Best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>

            <li>Excellent.     </li>
            <li>Best Norelco razor that I have owned, and I have been using electric razors since I started shaving.  </li>
            <li>This razor is not the best, as so indicated by a variety of consumer reports.  </li>
            <li>But after 1 week I am very happy with it.                           </li>
            <li>Received this arcitec at Christmas, for 30 days I thought what a great razor!</li>
            <li>I had tried a number of the Braun style shavers and they just ripped me up, yet others will swear that they are the best you can buy.</li>
            <li>Actauly I can say that Philips Norelco are the best electric shaver i had found.&lt;br /&gt;I have been used them for over 10 years,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a Norelco/Philips rotary shaver, and by definition, the best electric shaver made.  </li>

            <li>This Electric Shaver is the very best shaving and ease of cleaning it after shaving experience I have ever had.    </li>

            <li>I think this is the best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the shave this razor gives.</li>
            <li>and this is the best.</li>
            <li>I am giving it 3 stars since it was easier to use on contours and that Norelco customer service was excellent.</li>
            <li>It is especially good on the neck.  </li>
            <li>SPF-15 in it the best.</li>
            <li>The best I ever had was a panasonic</li>
            <li>The razor worked great on the beard on my face, but NOT AT ALL on the hair that grows under my chin!  </li>
            <li>Great product!</li>

            <li>And it is great about trapping the whisker debris (I shave before I get dressed,</li>
            <li>Turns out that this shaver works great for me and my beard.  </li>
            <li>Great technology there, Philips.  </li>
            <li>Great design, but not too close-cut</li>
            <li>It would be great with these adjustments.</li>

            <li>Cheers, happy shaving</li>
            <li>Over all a great electric.  </li>
            <li>and whenever I break it out of retirement, and it still does a great job, even with worn out blades.    </li>
            <li>Great product.    </li>
            <li>He also is happy with the trimmer that is part of this razor.  </li>
            <li>-Looks very nice  </li>
            <li>The shape made it very comfortable to hold,and gave excellent control.</li>
            <li>And most imported is the quality of shave, which I am very happy with.  </li>
            <li>one more perfect shaver from Philips, I like it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is beyond a shadow of a doubt the best razor norelco has ever made, and I have used many of them over the years.  </li>
            <li>The lithium ion battery is the latest and best battery technology.  </li>
            <li>The NORELCO Arcitec 1050 provides an excellent shave, cleans easily under running sink faucet.</li>
            <li>After the forth week on that blade I could not get a good shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good looking shaver, too.  </li>
            <li>He just loves it and would reccomend it to  anyone wanting a good shaver.</li>
            <li>I bought this product based on the hype, the review, &amp; the good name of the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li>Considering the price tag and sleek design, I figured I was in for a good shave.  </li>
            <li>Takes longer to get a good, close shave.    </li>
            <li>TheBraun shavers don&#x27;t provide as good as a shave from my experience</li>
            <li>Its really good.</li>
            <li>Good product, but don&#x27;t believe the \\&quot;lift and cut\\&quot; rhetoric.</li>
            <li>To some degree, is anything as good as it used to be, I don&#x27;t know?  </li>
            <li>Just not as good I expected/hoped from product description and reviews.  </li>
            <li>The razor does do a good job when I&#x27;ve already trimmed my hair</li>
            <li>Good luck if you buy a Norelco arcitec 1050.</li>
            <li>It delivers results virtually as close as a blade, and sometimes I think it is just as good.  </li>
            <li>and I wanted to get the Norelco because I had heard good things about it.    </li>
            <li>For people who like to shave after they&#x27;ve gotten dressed, that&#x27;s good news for Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parts</li>
            <li>For people who like to shave after they&#x27;ve gotten dressed, that&#x27;s good news for Norelco.      </li>
            <li>It is good they gave you two.    </li>
            <li>The shave is a good, close shave.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is fair.  </li>
            <li>A good razor, a good shave.</li>
            <li>Plus,so light and so ergonomically perfect in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The norelco arcitec 1050 works great and does what it is supposed to do which is give a nice close shave.</li>
            <li>The arcitec is much superior to the low-range model that I used before.  </li>
            <li>To summarize, I feel this is the best electric shaver available.</li>
            <li>good :&lt;</li>
            <li>I have to go over each area over and over and over and over literally and still not get a good shave,</li>
            <li>I also decided to shave my head, and the Norelco did a good job of conforming to my head.</li>
            <li>It also gives a closer shave than the others, but not as good as a foil shaver or a blade.    </li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t work for Norelco, just want to stand up for Norelco since I feel it is a good product.  </li>
            <li>and I was hoping it would be as good as the commercials touted it to be.</li>
            <li>B001AMRQ2W Norelco SpeedXL]] and loved it.</li>
            <li>This is a good looking razor, but that is about it.</li>
            <li>The shaver is a good value</li>
            <li>It looks good</li>
            <li>The shave to the neck is not that good</li>
            <li>This Norelco would probably be a good razor to keep in the car or office.</li>
            <li>Holds charge good  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t make the mistake of buying this shaver for its \\&quot;good looks.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>it had a good shaver performance</li>
            <li>shaver also can give you about 16 good shaves per charge.  </li>
            <li>you are good for two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It also looks good.</li>
            <li>Good product!!!&lt;br /&gt;HW,</li>
            <li>On the favorable side, the razor does a good job.</li>
            <li>had a Norelco razor for around 12 years and loved it</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cut good and leaves hairs everywhere.  </li>
            <li>I hear good things about Braun foil shavers and will probably purchase one of these.  </li>
            <li>After using the Norelco arcitec 1050 exclusively for a month I was still having rasor burn and not getting a good shave on my neck.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade, but if you change out the shaving heads every six to 12 months, you will get a consistantly good shave.</li>
            <li>but when I spend $200 dollars I just don&#x27;t want something that looks good</li>
            <li>and since I like to have a real clean shave I end up using my razor once in a while to finish the job!    </li>
            <li>CoolSkin 8040X which I use exclusively in the shower with Nivea for Men shaving gel, and it provides an exceptionally close shave with no irritation for my skin/beard type.</li>
            <li>Best of all, the price  with the super saver shipping, beat all others I researched.</li>
            <li>the best way I came up with  was to use a container with a sealable lid and fill it halfway with very hot water.</li>
            <li>This is a very elegant looking shave, but it doesn&#x27;t excel.</li>
            <li>I have used Norelco shavers for many years and was happy with them.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the Norelco arcitec shaver.</li>
            <li>I have used this for two weeks and am very pleased with the shaver.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Final note the Arcitec is great bathroom decoration and is better suited in the Sharper Image catalog than as a Philips Norelco product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very satisfied after 3+ years.</li>
            <li>I have waited the recommended 21 days before writing this review and I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with the razor and included travel case.</li>
            <li>I was able to return the Arcitec and am really happy with this Braun 9595 model.</li>
            <li>I was able to return the Arcitec and am really happy with this Braun 9595 model.</li>
            <li>He does like this and is very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Its a good razor, i liked it, but i bought this razor in february thinking that i will get $40 off.</li>
            <li>I liked it, but I had to use the shave talc stick to get a good shave</li>
            <li>Works perfectly and the price is right.</li>
            <li>It is light, stylish and the trimmer you all complain about is awesome.</li>
            <li>Norelco/Phillips Model 1050 Shaver is an outstanding product!   </li>
            <li>what&#x27;s not to love!  </li>
            <li>then that I love this razor!</li>
            <li>I must say, they have done a better job!</li>
            <li>The tactile feel of closeness is as good as a blade shave for me and very comfortable.</li>
            <li>I bought the Braun series 7, liking the look and reviews of it and found it did a nice job on my face</li>
            <li>It also comes with a really nice travel case that also plugs into the charger so you don&#x27;t need to remove it from the case to charge.  </li>
            <li>It may be louder, but it has a nice weight to it and is easier to grip.  </li>
            <li>It may be louder, but it has a nice weight to it and is easier to grip.  </li>
            <li>The beauty lays in the eye catching design and craftsmanship found in the shaver</li>
            <li>You have to buy one of the two top of the line Norelco models to get the good heads</li>
            <li>I still pull my skin in all kind of directions and run the shaver in all kinds of directions just like I did with the blade.  </li>
            <li>I own this shaver for over a year now.</li>
            <li>It has a good, comfortable feel when in use and gives me a good shave.  </li>
            <li>This razor is nice.  </li>
            <li>It looks sleek and has a nice stand.  </li>
            <li>how anyone could say otherwise is beyond me, well, to each his own</li>
            <li>I guess, what kind of mugs do you</li>
            <li>The pop up trimmer cant be used without catching your hair in the shaver</li>
            <li>My son said he liked this, he is still using it, it has been about a year now.</li>
            <li>I own the top-end Braun shaver (\\&quot;Series 9\\&quot; or something like that).  </li>
            <li>A nice feature of this razor is the tube trimmer.</li>
            <li>It does come with a nice travel case and charging stand as well.</li>
            <li>It does come with a nice travel case and charging stand as well.</li>
            <li>It does have a nice beard and mustach trimmer that flips out.</li>
            <li>I bought two of this kind of products for my father and my husband.</li>
            <li>But I liked it.</li>
            <li>Very nice shaver, Easy to clean and gives a great shave.         </li>
            <li>The razor provides a very nice close shave smooth shave for me.  </li>
            <li>My first Norelco did not have the newer heads that conform to your face, and while I got a good shave, it wasn&#x27;t great.  </li>
            <li>Great, innovative, light, maneuverable, and incredibly effective.  </li>
            <li>This new razor gives me the best shaves I have ever had.  </li>
            <li>My husband has used electric razors for many years and says this Philips norelco is absolutely the best he has encountered.  </li>
            <li>Cheers, happy shavingne minute quick shave in the evening.</li>
            <li>It looks so good and is advertised as their newest and best, but sadly, it&#x27;s not a shaver worth keeping.</li>
            <li>Great shaver very light super space age design very easy to use.</li>
            <li>He says it is, by far, the best shaver he has ever owned.  </li>
            <li>That turned out to be one of the things he liked most.  </li>
            <li>I have used Norelco shavers for 30 years and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>With this shaver, I can go in a circular motion, much more easily catching the whiskers on any part of my face or neck.  </li>
            <li>Consistently performs a perfect shave with fantastic speed and ease of operation.</li>
            <li>This one shaves fairly closely; gives a pretty good shave.  </li>
            <li>but if you know what to expect from an electric shaver and understand that real-world miracles are very rare, then a 5 star may be the fair rating.</li>

            <li>On the plus side - the shaving head is very good and offers a nice close shave.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer is nice to have, and works OK and is better than nothing.    </li>
            <li>It is much better built, it feels better in the hand and the trimmer is amazing.</li>
            <li>Good clean shave, every nook and cranny</li>
            <li>but I was able to successfully and quickly trim my mustache.</li>
            <li>I have a pretty med beard and it works great.</li>
            <li>either so I can grow a full beard with good coverage.</li>
            <li>This razor is very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>The unit is very light and comes with a stand and a travel case.</li>
            <li>Very smooth.</li>

            <li>The shaver works well and is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>The Arcitec&#x27;s body shape makes for a very comfortable grip while shaving.</li>

            <li>It cut quickly and did a good job.</li>
            <li>Very very close shave on the face and chin!!!</li>
            <li>What a huge mistake!</li>
            <li>I read many reviews before this purchase and still bought the product despite the crappy reviews.</li>
            <li>Most have been Norelcos.</li>
            <li>I have been using Norelco shavers for many years.</li>
            <li>Norelco says to keep using it, that performance gets better with time, but I&#x27;m not seeing it</li>
            <li>You will not be able to throw this in a breifcase and go.  </li>
            <li>unless you just like the novelty and asthetics - look for a more practical razor.</li>
            <li>I would recommend that if you are buying this shaver, make sure you can return it if you need to.</li>
            <li>It does okay</li>
            <li>For more than 24 hours of stubble, I have to break out the shave cream and disposable razors.  </li>
            <li>Oh and the sleek design that cuts neck hair better?  </li>
            <li>Any Norelco is better than this one.  </li>
            <li>Sleeker, more style.    </li>
            <li>My toothbrush has a more thought out charging system.</li>
            <li>Can someone please design and build a better electric razor?     </li>
            <li>Does the 1050X seem better built?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 44 and having been shaving for over 2 decades, been through many units.  </li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>and most of the time I need to run one of those over the spots on my neck that the arcitec misses.  </li>
            <li>so I thought more money might be better.      </li>
            <li>Nothing about it is better than my 5 years ago</li>
            <li>no matter how many passes you make.</li>
            <li>On top of this, the chambers don&#x27;t hold hair clippings so they shoot out of the razor and all over the user.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying more for Christmas gifts.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product but it doesn&#x27;t really work that well for me.  </li>
            <li>I find I&#x27;m able to get almost as close as a blade.  </li>
            <li>The last time I tried one was about 10 years ago, and I wasn&#x27;t impressed.  </li>
            <li>With the latest Arcitec design, I figured it was time to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Arcitec Models</li>
            <li>Even still, for every minute the shaver is plugged in, that is how many minutes of shaving you get.  </li>
            <li>I do two more passes and check the smoothness again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Better, but not as close as the Braun.  </li>
            <li>I found that after using the shaver for a couple of weeks and getting used to how it works, I&#x27;m able to match the Braun in closeness.  </li>
            <li>The Norelco looks better on the bathroom counter, no doubt about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>do two more passes and check the smoothness again.    </li>
            <li>Better, but not as close as the Braun.  </li>
            <li>I found that after using the shaver for a couple of weeks and getting used to how it works, I&#x27;m able to match the Braun in closeness.  </li>
            <li>The Norelco looks better on the bathroom counter, no doubt about it.      </li>
            <li>He is absolutely in love with every feature that this product has.</li>
            <li>The shavers you made twenty years ago were of better quality.</li>
            <li>and I use it for more than two weeks, shaving once a day.</li>
            <li>After using it for a year I bought a $35 Norleco at Walmart and got a better shave.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m getting better shaves.  </li>
            <li>Whoever made it went more for design than practicality.</li>
            <li>Since using the electric, my wife said she thinks my face looks better</li>
            <li>I am sure that these will corrode soon as will make additional problems with changing.  </li>
            <li>It caused many razor burns and made skin breakout.  </li>
            <li>I wish I had read more reviews (not just online, but also on Amazon) before purchasing this razor.     </li>
            <li>OK, they said wait 21 days.</li>
            <li>After about four weeks now, the rash is better and my face is adjusting.</li>
            <li>The instructions say to go in circles against the grain, but it works better if you just go against the grain in strokes.</li>
            <li>I am getting 25 shaves per recharge, better than advertised.    </li>
            <li>I bought a mustache trimmer, which works much much better than any razor&#x27;s trimmer.  </li>
            <li>But there are more electronics in the Arcitec than in my car.  </li>
            <li>And make sure you shave BEFORE you put on a shirt, because you&#x27;ll be wearing all the hair it doesn&#x27;t seem to hold in.  </li>
            <li>So I reluctantly bought the 1050, figuring if Norelco&#x27;s top of the line doesn&#x27;t cut it</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ll just quite my job and join ZZ Top.    </li>
            <li>In fact, the more I get used to the design features, it may eventually take the top spot.</li>
            <li>and I have had many.</li>
            <li>I love the way the head glides.  </li>
            <li>I shave every 2 days so this shaver is perfect for my stubble (I find daily shaving to be irritable).  </li>
            <li>I have used mostly electric razors of many kinds to avoid the nicks I sometimes got with non-electric shavers.</li>
            <li>I owned a Philips Norelco shaver that cost much more than this model (purchased Dec 2008).  </li>
            <li>However, even at more than twice the price the</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Philips shavers for probably over 15 years, I fell in love with them from the start....</li>
            <li>I am quite satisfied with my purchase of this product.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this weeks ago and still don&#x27;t have it so still waiting will write more when get it</li>
            <li>Cannot understand why this type of razor wasn&#x27;t invented many years ago.  </li>
            <li>Always pleased.  </li>
            <li>More than a day or two</li>
            <li>and I could never shave more than once</li>
            <li>A Satisfied Customer</li>
            <li>( I have used the shave for more than 20 days so this isnt a biased review )</li>
            <li>It looks great, feels good in your hand and is pleasantly quiet, but that&#x27;s it.   </li>
            <li>and in fact misses more hair that it should around the neck.</li>
            <li>it doesnt reach the top of ny moustache/bottom of my nose.</li>
            <li>I bought this because its the top of the line</li>
            <li>I have used the 1050 now for 4 weeks, and i have to make way too many passes with the thing to get my neck sufficiently.</li>
            <li>Which, in the process gives me more irritated skin after shaving.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a electric foil razor user for many years.  </li>
            <li>Some were better than others, but none even begins to compare  to this piece of junk.</li>
            <li>It misses about twice as  many under the jaw line.</li>
            <li>Oh and don&#x27;t worry, no one will be able to miss that you look like you had a blindfolded 3 year  </li>
            <li>but it is much better than what they give you.    </li>
            <li>the shaver and do not allow it to charge for greater than 1 hour\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I guess I can go get a $20 timer and plug it into that to make sure.</li>
            <li>I have tested many brands of electric shavers over the decades</li>
            <li>Love the color    </li>
            <li>I really did get the sense that it just wasn&#x27;t designed to give a great shave.</li>
            <li>It really isn&#x27;t all that great.</li>
            <li>then it is better to stick to just using a blade.     </li>
            <li>I like it much better than any of its predecesors.    </li>
            <li>I read most of the reviews posted here</li>
            <li>The trimmer does seem a bit under powered and does work better when you pop off the razor head.</li>
            <li>can say that the Artic has a better design</li>
            <li>am sure is quite better but how much better...</li>
            <li>I actually look forward to shaving with it, IT IS THAT GOOD!!!</li>
            <li>If that is the case I am sure glad that I have been a Braun user.</li>
            <li>I have used electric shavers for many years.</li>
            <li>Thank you Norelco and thank you Amazon for the best price for this magic facial hair removing instrument.    </li>
            <li>Overall I believe this is an excellent shaver for the price.</li>
            <li>No matter how many passes you take, it will miss some hairs.</li>
            <li>I love this unit and it suits me well.</li>
            <li>, I wanted to love using this shaver.</li>
            <li>Gosh, I wanted to love using this shaver.</li>
            <li>I thought maybe that this one might work better for my adam&#x27;s apple</li>
            <li>so I bought this one to compare (with the 45-day return policy at the top of my mind).  </li>
            <li>Braun is better, as most of the reviews and surveys said.  </li>
            <li>- it digs in where this one seems to glide over the top.  </li>
            <li>It does the best job in following the curvature of your face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK for sideburns</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not even sure I have shaved.  </li>
            <li>but did the job better than this Arcitec razor.  </li>
            <li>The best shave I got was after I changed the blades out but only lasted a month.  </li>
            <li>and I am therefore pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;- Super-protective (for travel mostly)</li>
            <li>is one of Arcitec&#x27;s better features.</li>
            <li>feature most of us buy a shaver for :)...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, for an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>The 8140XL was okay</li>
            <li>Norleco claim that the Arcitec has \\&quot;50% more shaving surface\\</li>
            <li>ask myself \\&quot;50% more than what?\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not going to say more because everyone can see the images posted on Amazon&#x27;s page.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not so sure the bulkiness is justified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I love it) stars.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not going to say more because everyone can see the images posted on Amazon&#x27;s page.</li>
            <li>(I like it) and 5 (I love it) stars.</li>
            <li>I was always concerned when Phillips bought this company that they would try to make the razor more of a Phillips style razor</li>
            <li>but they made it better.</li>
            <li>and the latest has better reviews.</li>
            <li>I am liking this razor more and more every time I use it.  </li>
            <li>and it has brought me to three conclusions: 1) You can&#x27;t please everyone but you CAN please most 2)</li>
            <li>The nature of lithium ion and lithium polymer batteries is that they CAN&#x27;T be over charged, they have no burn in memory, and are safe to leave in the charge at all times.</li>
            <li>OK in the shower.</li>
            <li>I read with interest, the most favorable review for this shaver.</li>
            <li>Better to suggest that the Phillips/Norelco engineers should take a crack at a better design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After my 3 years of use, it&#x27;s cost me well more than twice</li>
            <li>and the hype is should work a lot better.</li>
            <li>Does most of what it says.  </li>
            <li>It feels nice and comfortable in the hand.</li>
            <li>I love Norelco&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>and you have to go over areas many times.</li>
            <li>I have used Norelco for many years,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a Norelco user for 30 plus years, love their quality of product and shave.</li>
            <li>This latest Arcitec with its lack of replacable blades is why this company should go under.  </li>
            <li>guess is many of the good reviews are being written by persons who have not had the pleasure of trying one of Norelco&#x27;s older shavers to notice the amazing quality they can provide.</li>
            <li>My guess is many of the good reviews are being written by persons who have not had the pleasure of trying one of Norelco&#x27;s older shavers to notice the amazing quality they can provide.</li>
            <li>I never write reviews, but I felt VERY strongly about warning fellow loyal Norelco customers!</li>
            <li>What ever happened to the older heavier models with a great trimmer and  </li>
            <li>For the price I thought it would work great since I had heard that high end electrics work well.  </li>
            <li>it is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>The shaver stays nice and cool to the touch.</li>
            <li>If you want a good, close shave that doesn&#x27;t irritate, I wouldn&#x27;t make this the first on your list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First off, this is a good looking shaver.</li>
            <li>I also find the reservoir to be quite adequate in catching the shavings.  </li>
            <li>Surprisingly, the shave is as good as my regular razor blade.</li>
            <li>With a very cool design, nice grip and feel, and nice plastic travel case, I really wanted to like it.  </li>
            <li>Certainly, the accessories are more impressive than what Braun offers.</li>
            <li>The most important thing...</li>
            <li>This is the primary reason why I love this razor.  </li>
            <li>it has a cool feature how each head moves on its own to try and fit your face as you shave.  </li>
            <li>The Arcitec razor offers a great shave; I don&#x27;t get 3 o&#x27;clock shadow until about 7 pm.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not so sure the bulkiness is justified.    </li>
            <li>-what is with that-am I becoming mutant?</li>
            <li>The pluses: Battery life is great if you wait until the battery is nearly fully discharged as the manufacturer recommends.  </li>
            <li>I thought \\&quot;hey, it costs so much, it must be good, maybe I just need to get used to it.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>It appears to me that most reviewers do not take into account that when it comes to (high end) electric razors, the question as to whether a machine is \\&quot;good\\&quot; or \\&quot;bad\\&quot; does mostly depend on one&#x27;s own biological physiognomy, and not on the particularities of the brand.</li>
            <li>The travel case should me more user friendly.</li>
            <li>Cleaning the thing is really easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and easy top use.</li>
            <li>It cleans up easily under the tap.  </li>
            <li>Cleaning is easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s neat and easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>They fill  up very quickly and then begin to puke the cut hair all over whatever you are standing over while  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t worry, it is just as easy as running it under the faucet</li>
            <li>It is easy for caregivers to use and he can even use it himself at times.</li>
            <li>(lasts for 2-3 weeks easy).  </li>
            <li>Easy clean-up too.</li>
            <li>but you have to clean more often.</li>
            <li>The heads clog very quickly.</li>
            <li>I would strongly suggest looking elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>, I strongly recommend the 6863 XC model.</li>
            <li>While the shaver looks good, it has NEVER delivered a close shave-not even a decent shave.</li>
            <li>In fact, from what I now know, I would strongly recommend not buying any Norelco products.</li>
            <li>They all liked the product very much.</li>
            <li>-Is very clean while shaving and easy to clean up    Cons:  </li>
            <li>It was a comfortable shave but took me a good five minutes to get that real close &#x27;blade&#x27; smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>The natural question then is, what kind of architects designed this arcitec?!</li>
            <li>other wise its a good razor.</li>
            <li>I was all set to purchase my own, but decided to take his out for a spin first.</li>
            <li>I must say it&#x27;s hands down the best.  </li>
            <li>I have been hearing lots of really good things about this new razor Norelco has advertised.</li>
            <li>Quite frankly, the 1050 is just fine.  </li>
            <li>you dont need three models 1050/1090 would be fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fine piece of work.  </li>
            <li>I did replace the heads and now it works fine.</li>
            <li>I replaced it with a Norelco 8240XL which is excellent and half the price.    </li>
            <li>I guess for some others it works fine but considering the price</li>
            <li>yes this shaver looks awesome, after you hold it you can tell right away its a lot lighter and fits much better in your hands that the other Philips</li>
            <li>It looks nice and has nice features, but I think its functionality isn&#x27;t worth the high price tag.</li>
            <li>Slap a little Lectric Shave on my face and away the 1050 goes giving me the best, closest shave I have ever gotten with any electric razor (Norelco, Braun, Remington, etc.).  </li>
            <li>It was love at first shave!  </li>
            <li>My husband who is 78 was very pleased to receive this highly advertisied shaver.</li>
            <li>60 Day free trial sounds like the way to go.</li>
            <li>Cleaning is simple and battery life is great.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this to all that want a close and comfortable shave every time.  </li>
            <li>It can give me a smooth shave</li>
            <li>Charger doesn&#x27;t fit in travel case.    </li>
            <li>I do not like the cheap trimmer.  </li>
            <li>nothing wrong with it - it just seemed nice to upgrade to the latest and greatest.)</li>
            <li>Anyone want a free used Norelco Arcitec???</li>
            <li>It feels comfortable.</li>
            <li>, the flaw--unfortunately--is in it&#x27;s primary purpose, which is, as a shaver.</li>
            <li>I never write reviews but felt that this was important for people to know.</li>
            <li>but now I am getting comfortable shaves.  </li>
            <li>It still took up to 30 minutes to get a shave I was comfortable with.  </li>
            <li>His skin was irritated for a two days after and did not even get close to a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>This shaver affords men the closest and light weight shaver that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>SOOOO smooth and comfortable.</li>
            <li>The fact that P/N warranty terminates after the initial unit is replaced is not making me a happy P/N customer.</li>
            <li>They also recommend running the razor in a sink filled with soapy water.  </li>
            <li>It also comes with a great travel/charge \\&quot;pod\\&quot; that should protect the razor from everything short of a nuclear blast.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Seems like something that should&#x27;ve been available in the 90&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Great to finally shave with electric and no longer feel roughness under chin on the front of my throat!  </li>
            <li>The shaving result itself is not quite as smooth as with a 5 blade Gillete, but it comes close.</li>
            <li>I have a light beard, and use a pre shave lotion, and this razor makes face feel like a baby&#x27;s butt.  </li>
            <li>The 1050 holds a charge for a while and does clean fairly easily</li>
            <li>The Arcitec 1050 is comfortable, butter smooth, and cuts as close as a blade.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ergonomic and fits well in my hands; comfortable to hold while shaving.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t pinch or cut me but the sound of it made me think that it  had.      </li>
            <li>Light weight  </li>
            <li>It truly shaves every nook and cranny of your face with a light touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is fairly comfortable to hold</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>but it sounds cheap</li>
            <li>It shaves close around all areas of the face and neck and leaves the skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>The shave is close and smooth.</li>
            <li>I had to switch back to my Norelco Spectra razor, which wasn&#x27;t great</li>
            <li>If the trimmer is important to you, this is not the product you want.  </li>
            <li>A great improvement over the standard Norelco where 1, 2 or 3 of the cutter heads are used in varying combinations.    </li>
            <li>Believ Philips is doing a great job in their constant development of their shavers.</li>
            <li>Norelco went back to more diagonal openings with this model, which is good.  </li>
            <li>However it is not as good as my old Braun 7505.</li>
            <li>It absolutely does not shave as close as it claims!!!</li>
            <li>This razor is a work of art -- exceptional styling and quality of fit and finish as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li>Many of the reviews tout how much better this is than the older Norelcos.</li>
            <li>And to get it to get as close as I can get, it takes WAY longer than my older Norelco, needing MANY more passes.  </li>
            <li>It is built solid, has an amazing battery life, and shaves pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I have never had a clean smooth shave with this razor.  </li>
            <li>You end up with a clean but comfortable shave every time.</li>
            <li>It gives a close shave quickly and comfortably and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>The 1050 handles it all, smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>It shaves quickly, close and easily.  </li>
            <li>and it charges very quickly (one hour, with a quick charge for emergencies).    </li>
            <li>razor took the beard off with very little force and the best part is the way the heads conform to the chin</li>
            <li>Quick, smooth, effect, close, comfortable.      </li>
            <li>To be honest, I can&#x27;t find anything that is a distinct positive about this product.</li>
            <li>:it certainly looks very cool, it is light and easy to handle, not</li>
            <li>It is still operating on its original charge; 11 days and eleven shaves.  </li>
            <li>It has a great battery and lasts for a long time without needing a recharge.  </li>
            <li>I make a full double-pass across my face, then check the smoothness with my free hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First, I cut myself getting the damn thing out of the plastic packaging, I tried not to let that color my views :)    </li>
            <li>This is the first micro-screen razor I have used and it is better in all respects to the Norelco Arcitec except for the fancy styling.  </li>
            <li>This is the first micro-screen razor I have used and it is better in all respects to the Norelco Arcitec except for the fancy styling.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Norelco recommends that the full shaving head assembly is replaced once a year and an &#x27;replace head&#x27; indicator should light up on the shaver when that time comes</li>
            <li>This one was even better than the first.</li>
            <li>Not sure it&#x27;s the best razor they have ever made, but with refinements and tweaks</li>
            <li>Immediately, I noticed that the original head was smoother, closer and faster.</li>
            <li>I also own a new generation</li>
            <li>Kind of like a Saturday Night Live skit in the 70&#x27;s</li>

            <li>However, this one is easier to clean and use and he finds that it gives him a truly close shave.</li>
            <li>I clean and maintain it meticulously</li>
            <li>The ARCITEC gives the closest shaves and is easier to clean than others.  </li>
            <li>I use a disposable to clean up after everytime I use the arcitec.</li>
            <li>Now after you clean the bathroom sink (or wherever you were) of all the puked hair, you still get  to clean the razor.</li>
            <li>you can not take the cutters out of the combs  and clean them.</li>
            <li>I used foaming bathroom cleaner to clean it.</li>
            <li>Might as well use  what you have and with this razor you are going to use a lot of that anyway to clean up all of the  puked hair.    </li>
            <li>It is easier to clean.  </li>
            <li>We currently own the Philips Norelco 7340 Men&#x27;s Shaving System and were Ok with the overall shaving experience.</li>
            <li>Negitive&#x27;s    Don&#x27;t like to clean after each shave, but it is a must.  </li>
            <li>Opening all 3 of the razor heads to clean each one and then \\&quot;snapping\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Easier to clean</li>
            <li>my old Norelco died, I was thrilled to see this technologically advanced shaver.  </li>
            <li>The shaver tells you when to clean and when to charge.</li>
            <li>He was very well pleased with the shaver, and when he filled out the warranty information online, he got a coupon for a discount on another Norelco shaving product.</li>
            <li>No amount of rinsing in the water will clean the Arcitec heads.</li>
            <li>I should be able to plug the unit in directly and not have to lug around more junk to lose or break while on travel.</li>
            <li>I should be able to plug the unit in directly and not have to lug around more junk to lose or break while on travel.</li>
            <li>Flip the cover and try to clean it.</li>
            <li>I bought him this razor for an early Christmas present, and the results are excellent.</li>
            <li>From the first shave I absolutely love this shaver, it gives the closest shave and by far the most comfortable shave of all the high end electric shavers I have ever owned, and I have owned many!</li>
            <li>The older Norelco cut fine and the blades lasted more than a year.  </li>
            <li>The battery life is excellent between shaves, other than that it really is an inferior product.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still kicking myself for not buying this when it came out as a special deal...</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more, my old Norelco still has its original blades!</li>
            <li>Being able to clean with water without taking apart is a real plus.</li>
            <li>The new 8240 is very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>I traveled on airlines with it twice,using the included hard travel case/recharger,and it came through it perfectly.</li>
            <li>After the second week I found I had to scrub my face with the razor to get a good shave.</li>
            <li>After purchasing this one, I passed on my \\&quot;cool skin\\&quot; to my cousin which still works</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Norelco shavers my entire life with good results.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel that I need to use a blade to get a close shave any more, and  I&#x27;m really amazed by the results.  </li>
            <li>The true test of a razor is how well it shaves, and the biggest challenge to me is in the neck area.  </li>
            <li>So when my last one needed replacing, I decided to get a really good one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m keeping my day job (much to the relief of ZZ Top fans everywhere).</li>
            <li>I already own an old Norelco (http://www.amazon.com/Norelco-Deluxe-Reflex-Plus-Shaver/dp/B00009RB11).</li>
            <li>my last was a spectra good shaver but always missed my neck</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;ve always gotten better shaves with foil shavers, they are really noisy</li>
            <li>It comes with a satisfaction warranty, but give it the full test before you write it off.    </li>
            <li>According to the imprint on the razor, the machine is \\&quot;Made in the Netherlands\\&quot; - Hold on to your hat, if that is true:</li>
            <li>I really like this product, and with a stylish design</li>
            <li>Overall good shaver</li>
            <li>So, some might say that rating one&#x27;s results with a shaver is very subjective and that it might work for some better than it worked for me.</li>
            <li>While this might be true I have to add that picking up this shaver</li>
            <li>This my second Norelco, loved both of them.</li>
            <li>He is pleased with its performance, but does not believe it lives up to the advertising claims and the package was a real challenge to get into.</li>
            <li>Cool look.  </li>
            <li>In my case, it was worthwile to simply keep a good thing going a while longer.</li>
            <li>sum things up This razor does look cool</li>
            <li>It has more muscle and the pulsation thing seems to really work</li>
            <li>The manual claims (verified) that it can take a full charge in about one hour and, once charged.</li>
            <li>If you are simply looking for a good shave, I&#x27;d say give this a try.</li>
            <li>When was the last time you replaced the blades in an electric razor (O.K., a GOOD electric razor) for under $30?  </li>
            <li>If you think you like the functions of this razor but really aren&#x27;t sure about it, I would not recommend it because it doesn&#x27;t work like I think a razor should</li>
            <li>If you think you like the functions of this razor but really aren&#x27;t sure about it, I would not recommend it because it doesn&#x27;t work like I think a razor should</li>
            <li>I use it every day and it lasts for 3 to 4 weeks on a full charge.  </li>
            <li>I think who ever designed this razor just went for how sleek and cool they could make it look and</li>
            <li>It just won&#x27;t look as cool on your counter.  </li>
            <li>The shave is not bad on the cheeks</li>
            <li>I am so satisfied with the new Norelco that it has become my primary shaver.  </li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t use toothbrushes to clean floors because excellent results are only achieved through using the proper tools.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so easy - just flip up the blade covers and run it under hot water.</li>
            <li>The good news: Small, light, easy to handle, decent shave, Very easy to clean, cutter life.  </li>
            <li>I found a nice little Panasonic wet-dry shaver on Amazon that gives me a nice close shave and costs $30 or 1/4 of what I paid for the Phillips shaver-shame on you Phillips for selling a shaver that should just be a desk sculptue, but should never be used.</li>
            <li>and yes it shaves better than this brand new Arcitec!</li>
            <li>This razor is fantastic; fast, close comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>My skin felt really smooth after, plus there were no nicks (the kind you get with regular shaving).     </li>
            <li>By the time I was done with the blade, I had a super close shave.  </li>
            <li>I had the older version and enjoyed it.    </li>
            <li>The ease of keeping it maintanied makes it a super value.</li>
            <li>This is a great razor but you should upgrade to the 1090 if your boyfriend/husband likes to have warning of how much time is left until it needs to be charged again.</li>
            <li>It is fast and comfortable, and my face feels razor smooth.  </li>
            <li>It is fast and comfortable, and my face feels razor smooth.  </li>
            <li>which served me well for all this time but, when the time came to replace the old 8140XL&#x27;s heads I happened to notice that a brand-new Arcitec was available as a &#x27;lightning deal&#x27; for some $35 more</li>
            <li>Quick start guide card&lt;</li>
            <li>I have been a loyal Norelco user since I was 21.</li>
            <li>and this can result in quick shaves.</li>
            <li>If I feel like I want to get super duper shiny close</li>
            <li>Once in a while I will give it a one minute quick shave in the evening.</li>
            <li>It fills up with hair rather quickly so maybe that has an impact on how well it shaves.</li>
            <li>Also, the quality of construction using more plastic indicates that you are forcing your customers to purchase new shaving heads on an annual basis.</li>
            <li>So I got this new razor hoping that it would be even better than the XL.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always bought the top of line Norelco whenever something new and \\&quot;better\\&quot; came out.</li>
            <li>I have used Norelco razors for years, so I looked forward to this top of the line new model.</li>
            <li>I like that it is easily cleaned in the sink every morning and the heads mold very well to my face as I shave.    </li>
            <li>No matter whether I press lightly or strongly, go in circles or in straight lines, it just won&#x27;t cut that close.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned several Norelco razors over the years, and up till now they&#x27;ve all been pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I would give the slight edge to the 8040X in terms of closeness and comfort, but I love both, and if you prefer shaving dry, the Arcitec 1050X is an excellent choice.</li>
            <li>It does contour to the face really well, but it just doesn&#x27;t cut my stubble easily.</li>
            <li>The 1050X is lightweight, easy to hold, and the heads move so effortlessly to the contours of my face that it&#x27;s really a pleasure to use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Battery:  Early, new battery life is good, as with most new battery devices.  </li>
            <li>Early, new battery life is good, as with most new battery devices.  </li>
            <li>As it turns out, I&#x27;ve owned two other Norelcos and a mid-range Braun which have proven to be dependable, well made and produce a good, clean shave.</li>
            <li>used Norelco Arcitec to any of those who have written those positive reviews cheap for $75.</li>
            <li>I was excited the first time I used it</li>
            <li>This is the first rotary shaver I&#x27;ve owned, and it is by far the most comfortable shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get as good a shave with this new shaver as I can with my old one with worn blades.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m returning it and getting the old style for half the price that I have been very happy with.</li>
            <li>It looks beautiful, the battery last a long time, and it&#x27;s easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The flexible neck and the three independent floating heads make for a very smooth, comfortable and close shave.</li>
            <li>Feels good, if a little light, in the hand, too.</li>
            <li>My husband has a \\&quot;barbed wire\\&quot; beard and finding him a razor that gives a smooth, close and fast shave has always been a challange.  </li>
            <li>Shaving with the Arcitec is comfortable, close and fast.</li>
            <li>My primary shaving method has been the razor blade, supplemented by the electric for a fast shave now and then.  </li>
            <li>I used this razor last night and it was amazing.</li>
            <li>A truly fantastic razor at a reasonable and competitive price.</li>
            <li>The razor itself shaves very close and leaves a comfortable feeling on the face.  </li>
            <li>I shave with light pressure in reverse circles to the head comb angles and then vertical and horizontal stokes when I get real close.</li>
            <li>Philips Norelco arcitec 1050 Men&#x27;s Shaver gives the smoothest shave I have ever received, even better than the old fashioned shaving cream and razors!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If you are a road warrior you better keep your old razor.  </li>
            <li>I only wish there   was an electric that was efficient &amp; effective.</li>
            <li>In the end I replaced the batteries and heads on my old Quadra and use it more than the 1050.</li>
            <li>Several reviews here complain about the shaver head catching their hair when using the trimmer on sideburns.</li>
            <li>I got about 30 days worth of shaving before having to recharge.</li>
            <li>Might be a good idea for something that gets wet.      </li>
            <li>i ordered Philips Norelco arcitec 1050 wondering whether its worth its price.</li>
            <li>I watched a couple of YouTube posted reviews of the latest Braun Pulsonic 9595, and that shaver sounded about as loud (if not louder) than my Braun 8595 Activator.</li>
            <li>You be your own judge as everyone beard is different.  </li>
            <li>the advantages I&#x27;m about to tell you about make it worth while.      </li>
            <li>So, getting cut to ribbons much more frequently</li>
            <li>Both appear to be cheaply made and will warp such that soon I would expect to not be able to use them.  </li>
            <li>but you have to do it after every one or two shaves or it gets harder to get a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find myself going over and over areas to the point of frustration, all the while not cutting hairs.  </li>
            <li>I went for the norelco 8200 series that was more like my old shaver in structure</li>
            <li>the motors were powerful?</li>
            <li>and I often felt that I was going to break it as I pushed it under and around my neck to try (without much success) and cut the hairs under and to the sides of my neck.   </li>
            <li>The product is not even worth 25% of its retail value as it does nothing but irritate the skin and mind.</li>
            <li>Charging stand does not offer any additional benefit and miss being able to put a cord directly into the razor.</li>
            <li>Then the fun ended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It takes up more room in the suitcase than my old Norelco&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I bought one of these for my teenager for Christmas, and I was envious that he was getting a Norelco that was better than the old man&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>, she confirmed my 5885xl produced a better shave, in about the same amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does require cleaning after each use but well worth it.</li>
            <li>manual, covering FOUR separate models is surprisingly well written to the extent that you are not annoyed by having to find the paragraph that applies to your specific model so, know thy model number (it&#x27;s a 1050).</li>
            <li>&quot; (compare with the old 8140XL claim of \\&quot;up to 50% more shaving surface\\&quot;)</li>
            <li>useful feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>well worth it to me and for anyone that chooses an electric over a blade.</li>
            <li>With a 60 day return policy to Norelco, it&#x27;s worth a trial run.  </li>
            <li>and wow, his face feels so smooth!  </li>
            <li>The first week I was reasonably satisfied with the new razor and the closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li>I would prefer being able to leave the plug in the shaver, rather than remove it right after the charge is complete.  </li>
            <li>I have tried the Brauns and other electric shavers over the years to look for that next and best shaver..</li>
            <li>(I prefer the feel of the original model because this is one is smaller), and looks fancy sitting on the counter, but it does not do a better job.  </li>
            <li>First, it doesn&#x27;t shave closely OR quickly.  </li>
            <li>The power/rpms were plenty enough to tackle this job with relative ease and I am still very happy with this razor and can highly recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li>and you have to open each three top cover and clean them every time.</li>
            <li>but pretty close with some nice benefits that make it worth continuing to use instead of going back to a blade.</li>
            <li>All you have to do is pull the head off and you have a stand alone trimmer that is just the right size.     </li>
            <li>The size of the 5130 is just about right.  </li>
            <li>razor came right on time at a price i couldnt find anywhere</li>
            <li>I had on my right lower jaw bone (which I didn&#x27;t attribute to razor burn but thought it was a skin condition)</li>
            <li>(I think because of the bumps on the right lower jaw bone going away).  </li>
            <li>It is right at a right-angle to vertical.  </li>
            <li>, right?</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s just right for all.</li>
            <li>You can take the razor head right off and pop out the trimmer.</li>
            <li>Better yet, I was able to get a new one for only $66 on eBay.  </li>
            <li>, the first shave I got using it was incredibly close and clean, it seemed effortless, no doubt the three blades cutting on each head give a much better shave,</li>
            <li>Thankfully, I kept the old original head, and after suffering through the RQ12+ for a 45 days, replaced it with the original head that had 1 year of wear.  </li>
            <li>And since it was the most expensive razor I ever bought,I read and followed the owner&#x27;s manual very closely and took very good care of it.  </li>
            <li>I am without a doubt loyal to the norelco product but there have been other shavers which have cut closer and more comfortable to use until now.  </li>
            <li>However, let me say that it only takes about 30 seconds to rinse it under hot water, and then you are good as new.  </li>
            <li>Some of the reviews must have been written by the competition and 3) A little more attention to detail will help some of you understand the product better.    </li>
            <li>Most people are familiar with the Norelco design by now, which has different heads pivoting individually to really get the contours of your face.  </li>
            <li>Extremely close shave, very easy to use, and a breeze to clean.  </li>
            <li>So... Norelco certainly wins the prize for most quiet shaver.  </li>
            <li>So, for almost half off retail it was a good deal.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see the need to spend more for one of the models with a few more bell&#x27;s and whistles.  </li>
            <li>This is absolute baloney and, obviously, clear indications of just one more corporation that has been taken over by Greed and Deception.</li>
            <li>I very much wanted to like this razor.  </li>
            <li>Although it does look very modern</li>
            <li>Since one of the hardest things to do with a Norelco is clean it, this is a huge improvement over earlier models.    </li>
            <li>My older Norelcos were far better than this one.</li>
            <li>Sorry, but I do not want to spend this kind of money, when he can get a clean smooth shave from a cheap razor.</li>
            <li>If you do buy it, realize that the performance after 8 weeks is not going to be any different than the performance after 3, and return it if you don&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li>I returned this model and bought Norelco&#x27;s cheapest model the 7110x and its infinitely better for only a fraction of the price!</li>
            <li>We saw the advertisement for this razor on television and he was interested.  </li>
            <li>I went online and priced it at many different \\&quot;stores\\</li>
            <li>Replacement heads do not last the stated six months; three months is more like it, and they are pricey.    </li>
            <li>so I would expect it to at least have an intelligent charging system.      </li>
            <li>How many times have you had to get to work and the razor had a low battery?</li>
            <li>Get $50 off a future Amazon.com purchase when you spend $149 or more on eligible Norelco, Sonicare, Bliss Philips, and Tresemme products offered by Amazon.com, including this item.</li>
            <li>Read most of the 5 star review they only praise the looks.</li>
            <li>First, I just returned a Norelco 1050X ($190) after seeing almost no difference in shave between it and the Remington R-5130.  </li>
            <li>And, have always returned to Remington as Norelco products never did any better for the extra cash.</li>
            <li>a pretty sucky shave  </li>
            <li>but if it&#x27;s more than say... 5 or so days of growth I simply can&#x27;t use it without wasting a ton of time.     </li>
            <li>I received this Norelco as a gift when it first came on the market.  </li>
            <li>Frankly I was pretty convinced by the marketing, which claims that it&#x27;s the closest shave ever, etc etc.  </li>
            <li>Too much style and no substance!</li>
            <li>And it is more economical than blades in the long run.</li>
            <li>If you forget to empty after each shave, the contents are nicely distributed over your face and the area below.</li>
            <li>I have also used it in the shower and works pretty well in water too.    </li>
            <li>Norelco makes so many different models, I can&#x27;t figure them all out.</li>
            <li>When you encounter a hair with it, there&#x27;s a rather loud \\&quot;click\\&quot; sound.</li>
            <li>So, cost of maintenance might be higher.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what impresses me the most about the Norelco--it is very quiet.  </li>

            <li>That&#x27;s what impresses me the most about the Norelco--it is very quiet.  </li>
            <li>I never got a great shave and finally complained to customer service who told me that this was probably not the razor for me.</li>
            <li>The Norelco arcitec did not give me a close shave unless I spend many minutes going over and over the same places.  </li>
            <li>med   I almost thought the first shave was too close</li>
            <li>This was the first time I have owned an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>The Norelco 1050 is my first electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using blades since I first started shaving.  </li>
            <li>Does it give me as close a shave as I got with a blade - no, but it does get pretty close and</li>
            <li>She also thinks it feels as smooth as it did with the blade even though I can feel where the whiskers haven&#x27;t been completely eliminated.    </li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t bother getting this razor in the first place.</li>
            <li>had I not found so many others with similar experiences to mine.    </li>
            <li>The first 1050 I bought died after 18 shaves.  </li>
            <li>My next Norelco had floating heads that did a much better job.  </li>
            <li>This razor handled my 3-day growth pretty well.</li>
            <li>There are newer models of this shaver, and you should probably go with them, as I predict that they can only be better.</li>
            <li>I got the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Sure, it gives a close shave, but I have to go over and over and over the same spot to get it.</li>
            <li>After purchasing this product most of the red bumps have disappeared.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer works best when you remove the shaving head which merely pops on and off with ease.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m returning it to norelco and buying another more standard model!  </li>
            <li>You have to charge it first with either the charging case or the charging stand.  </li>
            <li>With my Braun foil razor It gives a close shave on just about the first swipe.  </li>
            <li>While this is subjective, the unit feels cheap and flimsy compared to my old Norelco.</li>
            <li>But Philips says use hot water.  </li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s okay for occasional side-burn trimming.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve  bought more than 10 different Norelcos over the years.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different ways of cleaning the heads of this thing and</li>
            <li>That is many hours extra work, over the course of a year or the shaver&#x27;s lifetime.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also more solid</li>
            <li>Try one of Norelco&#x27;s cheaper models first.</li>
            <li>I use a razor brush from an older unit, brush it out quickly over the wastebasket</li>
            <li>I use a razor brush from an older unit, brush it out quickly over the wastebasket</li>
            <li>Overall this is an OK shaver.</li>
            <li>It seemed that the design of this product should yield a better shave than traditional designs</li>
            <li>Initially it took many hours to charge the battery.</li>
            <li>Also, even though the razor is cleaned after each shave, it gets hot when used.</li>
            <li>The shaver works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>The razor does exactly what I want in a razor.</li>
            <li>Although Norelco customer service is  outstanding and excellent, but 3 months is no time for a such an expensive item.  </li>
            <li>After several weeks of using it I can say that the Arcitec is &#x27;better&#x27; that the 8140XL</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not totally bullet-proof but it probably ensures that most units don&#x27;t suffer any damage while in transit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually read it and I am better off for it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but my experience with the Arcitec is that my skin tolerates it pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with my purchase and Arcitec is now my &#x27;regular&#x27; shaver.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with my purchase and Arcitec is now my &#x27;regular&#x27; shaver.</li>
            <li>but for now this is just a total loss IMHO-not even sure to buy replacement blades as I just ordered the HQ9s for the 8270xl.</li>
            <li>First, everyone comments on design and style, so let&#x27;s get that out of the way.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but why pay up to $100 more for a unit that does all the same things?  </li>
            <li>My old Remington titanium R9710 was a good razor but it ripped the hair out of my neck area and left me with very irritated skin.</li>
            <li>If you want to try this product I would say go for it because Norelco has such a generous return policy and maybe you will like it better than I did.</li>

            <li>This person mentioned that this is their first electric shaver after a lifetime of using blades.</li>
            <li>I have a bit more actual experience with competing products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is not his first Norelco, but it is the first Arcitec model that he has had.</li>
            <li>The heads never stay in after you pull them out the first time (as instructed by the mfg. instructions) to replace them.</li>
            <li>First of all, it is noteworthy to understand that Norelco has discontinued ALL service operations in the US and Canada.</li>
            <li>There really was NO comparison!</li>
            <li>The motor is a bit loud; a more powerful loud.</li>
            <li>If it just shaved a little closer, and conformed a bit better to my head, it would have earned an easy 5 stars.    </li>
            <li>I have owned other Norelco razors and liked them very much, except for the problematic neck hairs.</li>
            <li>I have found that the shave is quite comfortable if you don&#x27;t overdo it - just shave until you are clean, and use an after-shave cream to avoid minor irritation.  </li>
            <li>, I honestly don&#x27;t feel that I should compare it to other models...</li>
            <li>The problem was always, that a significant amount of my hairs was either to curly or to soft to be cut efficiently by the vibrating blade of those modells.</li>
            <li>While the original Architec head shaves smoothly, fast and close, the new RQ12</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to get a nice smooth line.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to get a nice smooth line.</li>
            <li>They are the best blades ever, give a quick close shave and cost so much money  to replace ($28.99 msrp for 8 blades), that if I changed them out when I really should (weekly is ideal and almost necessary they go dull so fast), I will have paid for the Norelco Arcitec 1050 plus a little extra, in just one year of use.    </li>
            <li>It does clean the neck very well, plus the trimmer is a lot better than other Norelcos</li>
            <li>I have always found that wet shaving, even with my other Norelco which can do either, was WAYYY better and more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I noted before, the Arcitec is very gentle to my skin and this is the main reason, other than good looks, that I prefer it over the older model.</li>
            <li>I have come up with the conclusion that most of you work for the competition, or you would whine if someone gave you a hundred dollar bill with a wrinkle in it, or you are still trying to figure out how toilet paper works.    </li>
            <li>I have gone back to straight razors for awhile until I can find a better way.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mine for over a year and the battery still holds a good charge lasting over a week of daily use.</li>
            <li>I have been using those razors for the past 10 years and have had pretty good results.  </li>
            <li>I have ready many user reviews and some technical reviews on the Norelco Arcitec</li>
            <li>The head design feels better on the neck, and has not caused razor-burn if I do not stretch the skin tight like I need to with the original model.  </li>
            <li>While the end result of shaving is basically the same which is not surprising because the Arcitec implements the same &#x27;lift and cut&#x27; technology, it appears to be much gentler to my skin, the more flexible shaving heads better follow my face and neck, has a better grip, comes with a more protective storage/charger pod and, of course, is prettier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Each one offers a little more detail than the rest, but costs noticeably more for that detail.</li>
            <li>;  the trimmer works very well;  no fuss to clean, just open the three heads over the sink, they hold the shaved wiskers very satisfactorally until dumped (mini-minimal drops to the floor or my chest;  no need to rinse but probably smarter to do in the long run;  very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>Very cool blue LEDs and all that.  </li>
            <li>nothing but positive returns here.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do notice something else rather positive, though: no whisker dust on my clothes.  </li>
            <li>I do notice something else rather positive, though: no whisker dust on my clothes.  </li>
            <li>I bought this not knowing what to really expect as this was my first electric shaving machine.</li>
            <li>The docking station works well and it charges pretty fast and also holds it&#x27;s charge for quite some time.</li>
            <li>The first really \\&quot;out of the box\\&quot; Norelco in years.  </li>
            <li>I had no trouble adjusting to the shave, but the jury is out on the other aspects of what makes a good electric razor.  </li>
            <li>although this \\&quot;early warning system\\&quot; looks cool, it&#x27;s overkill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its quiet, lasts as long as specified and gives a pretty good shave to the face.     </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t told my son I don&#x27;t like it because he&#x27;s young and thinks it&#x27;s cool to just be shaving, and the 1050 does have</li>
            <li>The older two, overall work better.  </li>
            <li>On the positive side, the mechanism they designed for this is very clever.  </li>
            <li>It does take a little while to get the longer hairs, and if you go over your face more then 3-4 times it starts giving razor burn!  </li>
            <li>The three silver shaving discs contrast the black theme nicely.</li>
            <li>The Braun sounds Bold and Busy with its Bounding Buzz.  </li>
            <li>Most days I shave as soon as I stumble out of bed at 4:30AM, without so much as washing my face.  </li>
            <li>One minor issue with it is the trimmer on the back for sideburns is not as good as the Braun one</li>
            <li>The Norelco arcitec 1050, while doing reasonably well at the job of cleaning the scruff off one&#x27;s mug, seems to require more passes to do the same thing the older models managed with one.</li>
            <li>[cheap, cheap!), which unlike previous Norelco models, dies very, very young.  </li>
            <li>This just looks good but shaves are not very good</li>
            <li>My single blade electric shaver works better.</li>
            <li>I have to shave over and over to get certain spots, and I get shaver burn.</li>
            <li>The grouping of the three blades is to large.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is very precise but is very limited in its usefulness.  </li>
            <li>Overall I am extremely pleased with the new Arcitec and recommend it.</li>
            <li>Cleaning of the machine is easy and very efficient, you just open the blade covers and hold them under running water.</li>
            <li>In short, this is a great razor, not a perfect one, but a great one that does the job that I&#x27;ve long sought for a Norelco or any electric razor to do.</li>
            <li>Additionally, after seeing several reviews claiming that this razor was only good for shaving everday, and could not handle 2-3 day growth, I recently shaved after allowing my beard to grow for three full days just to test how the razor would handle it.</li>
            <li>The last thing I own to say is that the shave itself felt less smooth during shaving.  </li>
            <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t like the idea of having to clean and rinse it after each use, but really it only takes two seconds to do</li>
            <li>It looks nice and has nice features, but I think its functionality isn&#x27;t worth the high price tag.king razor, but the functionality of the razor itself is pretty bad.</li>
            <li>If you really like them so much how can you pass up a deal like that?</li>
            <li>In theory it should follow the contours of your face really well.  </li>
            <li>The 1090x costs as much as an ipod</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t really a problem</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t expect much difference.      </li>
            <li>Fortunately, this razor got lost on a cross country flight</li>
            <li>The case is VERY bulky to travel with.   </li>
            <li>After much waiting  </li>
            <li>Remington hangs with the Norelco products just at a much lower price.  </li>
            <li>Once upon a time I had a screen type shaver and it cut much closer.</li>
            <li>-Very</li>
            <li>But the point is, if I have to pull out my blade to take care of my neck, why not just shave my whole face with it?</li>
            <li>I have bought a Panasonic shaver which shaves much closrt and has lasted much longer.  </li>
            <li>But I needed it too much to wait for another one to show up.</li>
            <li>so it charges while in the stand which is really convenient.  </li>
            <li>thanks amazon</li>
            <li>And the shave is much closer - so close my wife noticed it before I could tell her.</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very futuristic.</li>
            <li>The discs are gentle.</li>
            <li>Although the Braun is a louder shaver, the trimmer does not introduce much added</li>
            <li>I really could use this razor in place of the Braun, day in and day out.</li>
            <li>Although the Braun is a louder shaver, the trimmer does not introduce much added noise.    </li>
            <li>I really could use this razor in place of the Braun, day in and day out.</li>
            <li>Then the 1050 is absolutely the model you should get as</li>
            <li>the much pricier 1090 is identical in every respect except that the LED array includes a battery charge countdown(which ironically draws power), providing you a ballpark idea of when you&#x27;ll run out of juice.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see much of a difference now and if not a differnce at all</li>
            <li>the head design and pivot features really work on stubborn neck hair.  </li>
            <li>If you buy this razor (which I don&#x27;t recommend) you will find it gets better over the 21 days, but in the end it still does not perform as expected.     </li>
            <li>With my old Norelco rotary, I had to really work to make sure my neck got shaved and sometimes had to touch up with a regular blade.  </li>
            <li>As stated by Norelco, it took several weeks for the razor to be really comfortable.  </li>
            <li>if you beard is like that get a straight razor and some foam.</li>
            <li>It was very well made,and looked it.</li>
            <li>: This razor really holds its charge well.</li>
            <li>Remember that if you are really dissatisfied, you can return it to Norelco within 60 days and receive a refund.</li>
            <li>Very efficient shave.</li>
            <li>The trimmer isn&#x27;t much, buy that seperate.</li>
            <li>I really like the look of this shaver</li>
            <li>I have very senitive skin</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this shaver.</li>
            <li>- i think it should really be around 100 dollars.</li>
            <li>Nearly $200 worth of junk.    </li>
            <li>So much for their line of  \\&quot;even on the neck\\&quot;.     </li>
            <li>That doesn&#x27;t work very  well either</li>
            <li>Thanks Philips for all of your assistance.</li>
            <li>and it worked out very well.</li>
            <li>I wish Philips had spent money on designing rather than advertisements to offer a better</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>The shaver also feels very flimsy and  not well built, much like a toy or a novel gadget.     </li>
            <li>and it really seems that you are not going to know whether or not the shaver you choose is going to do the job until you buy it and try it.</li>
            <li>Does not offer enough weight and support for that comfortable massage of the face while shaving.</li>
            <li>wanted to like this shaver, I really did.  </li>
            <li>so if anyone wants to get this razor for the $40 off look else where because you wont get it.</li>
            <li>This review comes from much experience with the brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean since you only need open the shave heads and rinse it under running water.</li>
            <li>The included travel case protects the shaver very well.  </li>
            <li>Would never spend so much on a razor</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this product to my family and friends.</li>
            <li>I am not going to use it that much</li>
            <li>needed, a number of indicators/warnings discretely light up on shaver&#x27;s body: low battery, charing indicator, needs cleaning indicator, travel lock and shaving head replacement</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ll ever have the experience of running so low on power that I can&#x27;t comfortably finish shaving.  </li>
            <li>but they were cheap (about 30 busks) and lasted only about 18 months.</li>
            <li>The flex head design works very well.  </li>
            <li>It has a sleek design and is much lighter (the sides are made of carbon fiber).  </li>
            <li>I have an Philips Norelco arcitec 1050 Men&#x27;s Shaver and really like it.</li>
            <li>I guess if that is the case, the reviewer doesn&#x27;t have much to compare this product with.</li>
            <li>very flexible.  </li>
            <li>VERY UNTRUE.  </li>
            <li>Third, this thing doesn&#x27;t cut longer hair; that is, it won&#x27;t shave more than a 1-day old shave.  </li>
            <li>The shave is good, stubble starts to show by late afternoon.  </li>
            <li>than it normally does if I shave everyday, but I was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>like rotary shavers and have used them most of my adult life, but this one is a let-down, especially for the $130+ price.</li>
            <li>With my old one track norelco it takes several more minutes to get close.  </li>
            <li>With my old one track norelco it takes several more minutes to get close.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I got this new one in the first place was because the 9170XL I have broke (plastic piece of the head broke of because of cheap design).    </li>
            <li>This new Arcitec worked very well when I first got it</li>
            <li>First new shaver I had in 10 years.  </li>
            <li>On the first shave, I was getting the shave I wanted; did not have to wait the 2-3 weeks for my face to get used to the new shaver, as warned by the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li>Nope, the old Norelco got rid of it right away.</li>
            <li>The clipper will protrude very slightly from the body and you cannot use it easily or effectively because the shaving head are in the way.   </li>
            <li>It is much easier to clean than the others, as each blade opens individually and you can really get in there with the faucet.</li>
            <li>You have to pop open three separate chambers rather than flip the whole head up to clean each blade.</li>
            <li>I have used Norelco shavers for many years and prefer them to all other models I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Better than other Norelcos</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it does a reasonable job in a pinch, and for a long time I never really knew what a good, close shave felt</li>
            <li>(one can&#x27;t blow it out without getting hair dust all over the bathroom, and it can&#x27;t be shaken into the wastebasket as easily as the older models), and I spray it quickly with Remington Silicone Lubricant (I can only find it at Wal-Mart, which is the only thing I ever go there for, by the way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:</li>
            <li>(one can&#x27;t blow it out without getting hair dust all over the bathroom, and it can&#x27;t be shaken into the wastebasket as easily as the older models), and I spray it quickly with Remington Silicone Lubricant (I can only find it at Wal-Mart, which is the only thing I ever go there for, by the way).    </li>
            <li>I have never had a shaver get total clean on the neck, but this razor did much better than any other I ever had....</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s perfectly clean for the next use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a small inconvenience for such a great shave.  </li>
            <li>I bought this thinking that more expensive is better and in reality, the exact opposite is true.</li>
            <li>I own this shaver and wish I would have taken it back but waited too long.  </li>
            <li>It comes with a travel \\&quot;sarcophagus\\&quot; (which I find a nice detail) which can also be used to charge the razor, and a charging stand; the hair deposit chambers for each blade do fill quickly, particularly with anything older than a day old stubble for me, and a sign comes up asking you to empty them - which is done quickly and easily enough.    </li>
            <li>Most of the times I had to use a conventional razor with gel after I had used the Norelco.</li>
            <li>Shave quality the same as the older design and trimming function has always been just adequate which means you should use a razor afterwards in certain areas.</li>
            <li>Like most modern rechargeable razors, it&#x27;s slightly underpowered compared to it&#x27;s plug in ancestors.</li>
            <li>On the older models you can remove and clean the individual blades.</li>
            <li>Besides the comfortable shave the Arcitec comes with pretty good support (money back promise, 800 support number), looks good and, based on my prior experience with an earlier Philips Norelco shaver, is likely to last for a long, long time.</li>

            <li>The built-in trimmer is small and effective.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately it only works for that- looking cool in your sink.</li>
            <li>The Norelco arcitec 1050 is beautiful and flawed.</li>
            <li>I own a trimmer set so the small trimmer isn&#x27;t a problem.  </li>
            <li>I have a better than average beard</li>
            <li>If you charge it up before you go out of town, (it only takes an hour for full charge)</li>
            <li>Full charge time is only 30 minutes.    </li>
            <li>The shave is quick, smooth and close, and the unique head design allows for some serious precision manscaping (if you&#x27;re into that sort of thing!)     </li>
            <li>but then the heads cap, the cleaning brush and the charging cord are &#x27;outside&#x27; and they are easy to lose, especially the first two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but then the heads cap, the cleaning brush and the charging cord are &#x27;outside&#x27; and they are easy to lose, especially the first two.       </li>
            <li>This is just way too much to spend on a shaver that, in my opinion, works little better than a toy.</li>
            <li>So back it goes to get one of the cheaper model (8200 series) instead of their newer design that may look great but fall very short of the other design which now is the 8200 series.</li>
            <li>My present Norelco, about 5 years old, is still going strong but needs a new battery</li>
            <li>So, basically I would say do not buy this razor, you can get a much better one for $ less than this one.</li>
            <li>The trimmer itself works much better than those on previous Norelcos.    </li>
            <li>If I got a lemon ok, but I put three different heads on that Norelco and all had the same results.</li>
            <li>Over the years there has been a steady decline in cycle time of the blade replacement and an increase in price.</li>
            <li>I bought this thing to replace an older floating head style Philips Norelco that I dropped and broke.  </li>
            <li>My older Norelco was close, but not quite.  </li>
            <li>Buy an older Norelco or buy blades - don&#x27;t buy this thing.</li>
            <li>There are 3 main Arcitec models: 1050, 1060, and 1090.  </li>
            <li>and I want to be super quiet.</li>
            <li>and I want to be super quiet.</li>
            <li>They reccomned the traditional style 8260xl that has blades made for more coarse hair.</li>
            <li>(that is if you&#x27;re lucky enough to have hair!).</li>
            <li>, so I use my older shaver for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, so I use my older shaver for that.    </li>
            <li>Oh, darn, I am now being forced to upgrade and I was quite happy with my current shaver.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some of the marketing claims: quick shave, 50% larger (than what???)</li>
            <li>Luckily I have a different razor for those purposes.  </li>
            <li>The main cutter assembly (RQ10, which Amazon sells for $35) attaches to the body and pivots like a joystick.</li>
            <li>Even my old first-gen Norelco Nivea razor with cheap NiCad batteries, could be left in the charger forever</li>
            <li>/&gt;Things I liked about this razor are that it holds a charge for a reasonably long time, it does a decent job, and it lasted me a fairly long time.</li>
            <li>Third thing I noticed was the sound is a much higher pitch and is simply noisy.      </li>
            <li>But along comes this slick new Norelco Arcitec with its sleek looks and amazing seemingly floating shaving heads.</li>
            <li>The pleasant items about using the electric include: I have only gotten two small nicks in two weeks.  </li>
            <li>The material finishes are extremely high end.</li>
            <li>(to prevent shaving too high on the cheek) - the rest of the time I can walk around or watch TV.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Norelco Arcitec.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>So, after a week with this shaver I traded it in for a Braun Series 7 Shaver and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m knocking off a star because I feel the price is a bit high for what it does.  </li>
            <li>a new head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing looks cool, the battery lasts a long time but it does not shave very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recently bought the Wahl Trimmer Shaper for almost $250 less and it does a FAR superior job.</li>
            <li>Well if you have a lot of money to throw around and want to give your teen son who barely has any facial hair a really cool looking gadget to show off to his friends then this might be a good way to throw your money down the drain.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The trimmer is just OK and will take a little getting used to because of</li>
            <li>It does take slightly a few more passes when shaving than my older Nivea Norelco, but it is not a deal breaker.  </li>
            <li>My last Norelco lasted 14 years and gave a pretty decent shave the whole time.  </li>
            <li>The other problem is the battery can not be easily replaced in any of the models.    </li>
            <li>The hard shell travel case is nice.  </li>
            <li>The new design eleminates the need for the pressure adjustment wheel on the older model.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much difference between this unit and the old (9170XL) style when it comes to the quality of the shave.</li>
            <li>Much easier than having the take all the heads out and swish them one at a time as with my old 7825.  </li>
            <li>The nice thing is that after a while, the face of the skin developes a specific soft touch, which does not develop with wet shaving.</li>
            <li>I have just normal thickness of hair and  growth.</li>
            <li>and I more often then not skip a few days on the weekends.</li>
            <li>I tried it two or three more times but it still felt harsh to me.</li>
            <li>During that time I needed to change shaving heads twice (which seems fairly normal to me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So maybe that the poor 1050 performance was a good thing.    </li>
            <li>On a final note, the stand is a bit flimsy and tips easily, and the plug is a bit large, but those are minor considerations.</li>
            <li>I can assure you that after nearly half an hour of ramming and  scrubbing this thing around on your neck, it will have a nice red glow for about 2 or 3 hours that  just screams \\&quot;hey look at my 15 minute halfass</li>
            <li>It was decent but left too many hairs, not smooth and was hot to the touch.</li>
            <li>Since I have Irish, red, naturally curly hair on both head and face the close AND comfortable shave is appreciated.</li>
            <li>You definitely need to make sure that your face is very dry when using it, or else you&#x27;ll find yourself pressing it against your skin to try to pick up a stray hair</li>
            <li>I am still using the original (initial) charge, and although I don&#x27;t use this razor to shave everyday, I originally charged it Christmas Eve.</li>
            <li>I purchased a new blade and washed the razor every day.</li>
            <li>I was so horrified by their \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; model,</li>
            <li>If you leave the razor in it&#x27;s charging bay when its fully charged you will deplete the battery live.</li>
            <li>I have owned this razor for about 18 months and it doesn&#x27;t live up to it&#x27;s promise.  </li>
            <li>This new thing must have been designed by a woman.  </li>
            <li>So I bought a new set of blades.</li>
            <li>I can live with that.    </li>
            <li>Rotten product, can&#x27;t believe I fell for the hype, and can&#x27;t believe I have to buy a new shaver.</li>
            <li>Not one for close shaves, I needed a new shaver and fell into the Consumer Report thing of buying the highest rated shaver:  Braun 8985.  </li>
            <li>Finally a new design I have been shaving with norelco for 25 years</li>
            <li>When that razor needed new blades I decided to splurge and get this one, since a set of heads would cost as much as a new razor.    </li>
            <li>Even with brand new blades this razor misses about 1 in 10 hairs on my neck.</li>
            <li>and they suggested I purchase NEW heads.</li>
            <li>Do you need new heads every 30 days?</li>
            <li>My advice to those in need of a new shaver:</li>
            <li>update: Still using it, with new blades.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not trusting the new Norelco &#x27;3D&#x27; razor.</li>
            <li>In the interest of trying something new, I have tried electrics before.  </li>
            <li>One user even said it costs almost as much as a new razor.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s $33 and change on Amazon for a new razor head.  </li>
            <li>So I bought a new 790CC Braun Shaver.</li>
            <li>I guess that works for them since they hope you will then buy a new shaver.  </li>
            <li>It shaves faster, better and it gets into the hard to get places much easer.</li>
            <li>Clean, relatively quick saves; gets the long wiskers too; smooth face;  no razor burn; long lasting (long!)</li>
            <li>Actually, the sound is a low drone...</li>
            <li>The shave overall is ok, but not very close.</li>
            <li>However, it means the razor sits open drying most of the time which is no real problem, but annoys me.  </li>
            <li>After trying the Braun Pulsonic and finding it a bit rough on my face the Arcitec worked much better (your face may react differently</li>
            <li>Lift-and-cut is a ridiculous concept and a marketing ploy, but Norelco&#x27;s do a nice job.  </li>
            <li>It takes the same time to get a smooth shave, and the same persistance in some areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The pivoting head technology is clearly inferior to Norelcos older units.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most likely, Norelco is just being careful.  </li>
            <li>You have to wash it very frequently because the reservoir for stubble is non existent.  </li>
            <li>As a consequence, the shaving required more mechanical pressure and an increased number of strokes, resulting apparently also in increased micro skin injuries, followed by typical skin burn or even rash over time.</li>
            <li>However the trimmer blade--for sideburns, etc., is not easy to use or as effective as the traditional Norelce triple-header shaver.</li>
            <li>The new razor arrived in a sealed new package,like they have at the store,and they also sent a postage paid label,and instructions to send the old razor and all accessories and a copy of the invoice in the box the new one came in,and I could then just put it in any UPS drop box to mail it.  </li>
            <li>And, worse, must clean after each use, and it is 3X harder to clean because you have to individually open three compartments, using two fingers, after every use or two, compared to the old style where you can just flip it open, easily, with your thumb and clean it every week or two.  </li>
            <li>First, the trimmer is short and cuts your hair when you try to trim your sideburns.  </li>
            <li>While it didn&#x27;t cut me it left my skin feeling hot and worn out.  </li>
            <li>I researched the field pretty well and read various reviews.  </li>
            <li>Cleanup is a snap - pop open the three chambers and rinse with hot water.  </li>
            <li>The days I shower first, 12 hours later it is like I just shaved.</li>
            <li>When I first saw the commercial for the arcitect, I was intrigued.</li>
            <li>Prior to buying, I read many many of the reviews and as a result was quite skeptical and leary about trying one.  </li>
            <li>and I am experiencing exactly the same problem</li>
            <li>This is the first time i&#x27;m actually using an electric razor</li>
            <li>I have used in the past, although this may be because it&#x27;s a higher-priced, better razor.    </li>
            <li>Simply open the heads and rinse with hot water.  </li>
            <li>First of all it wouldn&#x27;t cut anything beyond one days stubble, Second</li>
            <li>Hang onto your old Norelcos for trimming!    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty obvious you are supposed to.  </li>
            <li>One last observation, and I&#x27;m not the first one to make it...  </li>
            <li>So I made a return for the arcitec and what a major change!!!</li>
            <li>The included travel carrier is useful, though a little tricky to figure out how to use at first.</li>
            <li>After about 6 shaves now, I get a shave as good as a razor and cream, and with less time and mess.  </li>
            <li>It is now clear to me that making cheaper products and offering no service is Norelco&#x27;s new business model.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the 1050 to replace my old Phillips Quadra 6865 which needed new heads and rechargeable batteries.</li>
            <li>The complete head is changed for a new, one piece, bladed head; takes seconds to change.    </li>
            <li>When my old Remington shaver&#x27;s battery started to die I decided to change for a new razor.</li>
            <li>So, I travel with my old NORELCO and use the new Arcitec 1050 at home.</li>
            <li>I replaced the cutter head at 12 months, but found out my old head still cut at about 90% - 95% of the new one, so the cutters are durable.  </li>
            <li>and it still doesn&#x27;t shave as closely as my old Norelco or my new Gillette Mach 5.  </li>
            <li>A quality consumer article made in a country where people get real wages paid and have social security and health care.</li>
            <li>I think one reason for the harsh shave is that it doesn&#x27;t have the floating heads anymore that easily give to the contours of your face, this seems to plow into curves instead</li>
            <li>I actually think I can shave with a normal bic razor &amp; shaving cream just as fast as I can with the arcitec, though</li>
            <li>The 1050 has only 1 indicator for battery recharge needed, the 1060 has several LED indicators showing how much charge is left, and the 1090 has an LED double-digit display showing how many minutes of shaving are left.  </li>
            <li>Adorned in several shades of black, dark gray, and silver, with catchy real carbon fiber side panels and a matte rubber finish along the backside for good grip.</li>
            <li>In addition, it shaves quickly and closely with minimal irritation.</li>
            <li>I will do a 4 stars at this time for a good quality, well designed electric shaver that appears to be an incremental improvement over previous generations but whose capabilities may be a little over-hyped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will do a 4 stars at this time for a good quality, well designed electric shaver that appears to be an incremental improvement over previous generations but whose capabilities may be a little over-hyped.    </li>
            <li>After reading some of the positive reviews; I don&#x27;t understand why their experiences can be so radically different than mine.</li>
            <li>so while I had braved the cuts and waste of money and time of creams and razors-and yes they are closer shaves for a lot more money-and blades that cost about same as gasoline, I have always felt that if I shower first to soften my tough beard, then let my beard dry a bit, the Norelco was almost as good as a blade.</li>
            <li>Even after a lot of razor burn I still had quiet long hairs left on my neck and on my chin after many passes.     </li>
            <li>The design is far out, way too far out!</li>
            <li>I am baffled by these poor reviews, I used a norelco before with the three heads, but this one is markedly BETTER!</li>
            <li>The Braun is better overall, but by a slight margin.</li>
            <li>The Braun is better overall, but by a slight margin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a very nice looking razor, but the functionality of the razor itself is pretty bad.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent 5 minutes many times, fishing a  single head hair out of one of the cutters.    </li>
            <li>was that the blades had a really tough time snagging hairs when it&#x27;s warm or humid.</li>
            <li>Now maybe I&#x27;m just one unlucky guy, getting two shavers that have exactly the same problems and almost within the same time frame (1 year), but this seems to indicate a design flaw in this particular model.</li>
            <li>And what is with the trimmer, you cannot trim anything or cut your hair with this trimmer-you cannot even see what you are doing should you want to do a quick side burn or sides of your hair trim as with other Norelcos.  </li>
            <li>Well, I had high hopes for this razor but after using it for a few months ago, I must say it is a piece of cool looking</li>
            <li>I also find this razor to be a lot easier to clean than previous Norelco razors.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to believe the negative reviews because they&#x27;re not just criticisms of obscure details of this razor; rather, they&#x27;re criticisms of the ability of this razor to do its main job.    </li>
            <li>looks&#x27; is clearly Arcitec&#x27;s distinguishing feature.</li>
            <li>The looks&#x27; is clearly Arcitec&#x27;s distinguishing feature.</li>
            <li>I am offering to sell my 3 months old</li>
            <li>I replaced a few batteries and quite a few cutters, but overall it was great.    </li>
            <li>First, it took twice as long  to shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone back to my straight edge.</li>
            <li>Second, the blades are not replaceable, so you have to replace the whole head assembly.  </li>
            <li>I regret getting rid of my old Norelco before trying this one.  </li>
            <li>For this old guy it even works on eyebrows and nosehair</li>
            <li>not so compared to my old Braun 7550 which I was buying blades for every couple of months..</li>
            <li>I would prefer to have a stand and a way to connect the cord directly to the razor.    </li>
            <li>This unit is louder than the old (9170XL) style units.</li>
            <li>I bought this product as a gift for my 24 year old son.  </li>
            <li>I replaced a Norelco speed razor that was getting old.</li>
            <li>I have used Norelco razors off and on for nearly 40 years.  </li>
            <li>I bought this  Arcitec shaver when my old shaver&#x27;s batteries died.</li>
            <li>I use the clippers on my old Norelco to trim sideburns, mustache, and ears.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to return to my old Norelco for a truly close shave.</li>
            <li>This design, however, is poorly developed.</li>
            <li>Sometimes, you can&#x27;t improve on the old reliable.</li>
            <li>Plug the shaver back in for 5 minutes, and you&#x27;re ready to go for your shave.  </li>
            <li>The battery has lasted through about six shaves so far and doesn&#x27;t seem to be losing power.  </li>
            <li>I had to return the product as after about two weeks my skin started to get very irritated, especially if I tried to get a close shave.</li>
            <li>The early model is near 45 degrees.  </li>
            <li>As a final note, I think the reason this razor does not work very well may have a lot to do with the mounting of the heads.</li>
            <li>and I have been pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I have coarse, wiry whiskers, and plenty of them... and they grow fast.</li>
            <li>I wound up getting replacement parts for his old Braun razor.  </li>
            <li>I find myself using the old shaver instead of this model.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Philips shavers for 20 years and now this machine show me that I should change my old Philips before.</li>
            <li>If you have never used an electric, try this one, and you will be surprised.</li>
            <li>While it does give a closer shave than my old Norelco, the battery must</li>
            <li>The floating moving heads are too soft to allow pressure to be placed under the neck where it&#x27;s needed</li>
            <li>I tried, for a whole year, but I gave up threw the shaver in the trash and went back to a blade.</li>
            <li>I had an old Philips rotary shaver for years until I dropped and broke it.</li>
            <li>and I had been so please with the old one.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the fact that you can&#x27;t plug a cord directly into the razor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used nothing but Norelco razors since I was 15 years old.</li>
            <li>And I do not even have sensitive skin.    </li>
            <li>Sounds like the old lithium ion safety problem strikes again.</li>
            <li>I wash my old heads maybe once a week.</li>
            <li>i find the Artic for repleacment my old shaver</li>
            <li>You would have to set it directly on a hair to cut it.  </li>
            <li>Buy it for looks and keep your old one in the drawer for sideburns.  </li>
            <li>Well, I did like the head that swivels to the contour of the face, but that&#x27;s about as far as it went.</li>
            <li>My old Norelco&#x27;s have never exhibited this sensation, so I was somewhat surprised.</li>
            <li>However, I did order a replacement set of blades for my old Norelco from Amazon.</li>
            <li>The 1050x is about 2-3 time noisier than my 15 year old Norelco, WTH?</li>
            <li>a few minutes after my shave test had ended, my 1050x side was now irritated and not feeling comfortable [like my 5885xl side was].</li>
            <li>The Arcitec is replacing my almost 3 year old [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is no way to replace the battery inside the shaver but, based on my experience with Architec&#x27;s precursor, my 2.5 year old 8140XL, this should not be an issue.</li>
            <li>I used to use an early foil remmington years ago.</li>
            <li>It is so much easier for him to use this on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>I bought it because I needed to replace my old razor.</li>
            <li>but I really wanted to try it out and only had stubble on my face at the time.</li>
            <li>what continuing with \\&quot;old faithful\\&quot; would have cost when considering the price of the shaver and scheduled replacement heads.  </li>
            <li>I bought this razor because I thought it would be an improvement over my old Norelco.</li>
            <li>it is worth every penny spent.  </li>
            <li>this is a much better shaver than there earlier model i bought a few years ago.  </li>
            <li>Losing the occasional red spots on my neck was very much worth it.</li>
            <li>Losing the occasional red spots on my neck was very much worth it.</li>
            <li>About 2 years ago, the battery in my beloved Braun started to fail.</li>
            <li>For decades, I wet shaved with the most expensive (and best) Gillette blades, because every episode with a Braun shaver resulted within a short period in serious skin irritation.</li>
            <li>I purchased a third blade and for 3 weeks I got a decent shave but still with the above issues requiring the use of a straight razor.</li>
            <li>You just run hot water over the circular blades and air dry.    </li>
            <li>I got into the habit of shaving using water alone first, followed by dry, followed by an aloe lotion.  </li>
            <li>I like to use oil before I shave and the 8240 allows me to remove the heads, dump them in a container with some rubbing alcohol, and easily clean them with a few shakes.</li>
            <li>I typically will use an electric razor to trim it to short, use this razor to get most of what&#x27;s left and then use a foil head to get it to be even/</li>
            <li>I still have several older Norelco models for comparison, one in my travel case, and one in my RV.  </li>
            <li>It replaced my older Norelco, which was the 2nd Norelco I owned, so this makes #3.  </li>
            <li>It took about a week for the shaver to break-in enough that it got everything on a first or second pass</li>
            <li>Expect a pimply rash at times as well, of which was never typical of my skin.  </li>
            <li>Overall a decent product.</li>
            <li>Usually they do not last more than an year.</li>
            <li>The reality is that the 3 heads together add up to a decent shaving surface, and the Arcitec&#x27;s are not larger than the 8140XL&#x27;s</li>
            <li>The shaving experience is much different; a clever design change, which I like.    </li>
            <li>A recent try with a high end</li>
            <li>I have gone back and forth between the razor and my old triple-head Norelco and decided it was time to get a new one.</li>
            <li>After trying out a Philips (Norelco) 7120 to see if I could escape the wet razor trap I was ready for the next step; that model worked fine, except that by design the battery doesn&#x27;t last that long</li>
            <li>It is about half  an inch wide and while it does work better than the rest of the razor it sounds like a wood</li>
            <li>This product is for people with beards that are not thick or coarse.</li>
            <li>First off the heads do not float and the triple head which I expected to give and get into places where i normally have to go over again actually is firmer and makes me have to repeat 3, 4 argg 5 times.</li>
            <li>I have been mostly a blade man for about 25 years, having only made a few brief attempts at using an electric.  </li>
            <li>and I thought my beard was not very tough, especially with the razors and cream.</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s a more expensive, flashier looking gadget that succeeds in looks/packaging and fails in its main mission: to shave.  </li>
            <li>it is good if you wanted not a perfect shave but a quick shave, recommended for wet and Dry mode........</li>
            <li>I think as a fair courtesy Phillips Norelco should offer all arcitec owners a 50 percent off if they trade in their old arcitec for the new one as I feel totally ripped off, almost angry enough to switch to Braun</li>
            <li>The Arcitec wins hands down.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just my facial hair \\&quot;type\\&quot;, or maybe using the Lectric Shave helps that much more than the users that put no pre-shave on, but all I can tell you is that I get the results I&#x27;ve desired for a long time--a close shave with NO remaining neck and chin stubble--with NO irritation and spending less time doing it.       </li>
            <li>As I noted above, all indicators and warnings light up when only when needed and are invisible at any other time.</li>
            <li>As I noted above, all indicators and warnings light up when only when needed and are invisible at any other time.</li>
            <li>So anyhow I just bought the new 1050 at wally world and it is quite different.</li>
            <li>Then we got prompted to buy the Philips Norelco arcitec 1050 Men&#x27;s Shaver after we got influenced by the massive ad campaign of the new arcitec series from Philips.</li>
            <li>They can offer NO remedies to my concerns, and only indicate the &#x27;company line&#x27; that the new RQ12+ is &amp;#34;better&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>but I cannot say that it is any better or worse than the trimmer on my old Norelcos, though it is narrower.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to the regular size beard and sideburn trimmers that are common on most Norelco razors; this one is about 1/3 the size.  </li>
            <li>The Phillips machine uses rotating blades, at comparably low speed, and for whatever reason, the blade rotation technology (which is in existence for at least 50 years or so) cuts my hair much more efficiently than a horizontally vibrating blade bar.</li>
            <li>It worked very well with short hairs and left me with no irritated skin on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>I REALLY wanted this shave to be the one because it was the most expensive shaver I bought..</li>
            <li>I replaced a different manufacturer&#x27;s very old electric razor with the Arcitec 1050, and have been using it for about three weeks.  </li>
            <li>This only noteworthy things about this old unit is that I have had to have the batteries replaced only two times, but this is normal since they wear out every 6 years or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He says it gives the closest shave than any other shaver he has owned ( we have been married 33 years</li>
            <li>One of my pet peeves with current and past Norelcos is placement of the power button, which I would accidentally turn it off with my right thumb (onc certain models).  </li>
            <li>Further, Norelco should really be ashamed to be making such astonishingmarketing claims for a product that is so clearly defective in design and such a step backward in product evolution (devolution).      </li>
            <li>I tried Norelco&#x27;s first generation of the Nivea wet shaver and it was great, though it did run out of Nivea fast, which was hard to find and expensive</li>
            <li>I quickly wore out the the cleaning  brush they supplied and started using a stiff bristle toothbrush instead.</li>
            <li>However, if I was using a new blade, I would frequently have several deep cuts and nicks.  </li>
            <li>This new head style has really been a downgrade because when you apply pressure, the heads seem to pull away from your face on the outside part of it and it makes it harder to shave.</li>
            <li>I worry about long term repair costs and reliability vs. the older style.</li>
            <li>Shaving with this model takes twice as long as my older model.  </li>
            <li>Unlike other Philips shavers you can not plug this shaver into your outlet, you have to place it in the carrying pod or shavers stand, this is a inconvenience to me, I am pretty sure its a matter of time before I drop this carrying pod and break it, or worse spill water on it by mistake and damage it ( the charger is not water proof).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A grown man with a tough beard will find that this functions better as a paperweight than as a razor.  </li>
            <li>This is a minor issue and I would recommend this product highly anyways.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I only feel this way because I have been used to a regular Gilette razor and my expectations were too high.</li>
            <li>I think it may come down a little more astime goes by.  </li>
            <li>The only draw back about this shaver is it can be a little tedious to clean because each head opens separately but other than that this shaver is a great product.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is not very user friendly compared to other Norelco shaver trimmers.  </li>
            <li>Also on the downside, the side-burn trimmer is completely inadequate; it too tiny to be functional.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m back to my old Norelco now.</li>
            <li>If the engineers would actually use this razor they would notice that removing the abaility for you to connect the razor directly to the charging cable is a problem.</li>
            <li>The head design is very similar to the old (9170XL) one</li>
            <li>There is a low battery indicator and it seems to last a few days even after that light comes on.  </li>
            <li>I went back to my old Norelco and will be hesitant to buy another.  </li>
            <li>You have to go over areas many times and sometimes, if the facial hair is too long (say, past a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow) the razor won&#x27;t cut it at all.</li>
            <li>I ended up switching to a regular old Mach 3</li>
            <li>It gives a barely acceptable shave if you shave every day.</li>
            <li>It was going back 10 years as far as shaving is concerned.  </li>
            <li>It doesnt give a close shaver, even though I spent twice as much time shaving.</li>
            <li>Even with the head removed, it barely trims my mustache.  </li>
            <li>After a year of all of the above I have just completely had it with the piece junk.</li>
            <li>Overall: Buy it for looks and keep your old one in the drawer for sideburns.  </li>
            <li>and if you are not careful you will encounter razor burn.</li>
            <li>I do not recommend this product to anyone and especially people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I was devastated that my wife gave me this requested gift and could not get it at Costco (now I know reason) and found that I had to go back to my 8270 xl in order to complete my shave under my nose, on my cheeks and on parts of my neck.     </li>
            <li>This razor does especially well on 2 or 3 day old beards.</li>
            <li>These blades were costing me more that one dollar a day to shave and giving a poor shave at the three week mark.</li>
            <li>, it did slightly better on the neck but did a worse job on the face.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes you need to go several times over the same neck spot because &#x27;lift and cut&#x27; is good but not perfect</li>
            <li>I would have given it 5 stars if not for the poor trimmer, like most reviewers mention.  </li>
            <li>shaver comes to you inside a triple-layered protective/defensive enclosure, hard plastic over cardboard over another clamshell (but easy to open) protective plastic layer.</li>
            <li>I actually had my wife feel both shaves afterwords to confirm I wasn&#x27;t being overly critical of my new toy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am not thrilled that the razor has to be washed daily, but it is easy to do.  </li>
            <li>I leave the heads open to dry and then close them when I am ready to use it again.</li>
            <li>The springs under each shave head are quite stiff, and the design means that the heads rarely sit flush against the face.</li>
            <li>The plus side of it is that it costs about $100 less and looks pretty swanky.    </li>
            <li>As stated by several (or most) reviewers, the trimmer is the really weak point.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s hard to clean, too.</li>
            <li>Now with the other Norelcos I&#x27;ve had that was never too much of a problem.  </li>
            <li>Hard to clean.</li>
            <li>Cleaning is much easier with this one than any other I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>There really isn&#x27;t much else to say about the trimmer other than I thought it worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The result is not very good, even on a good day I have a shadow, my face feels rough and after shaving it is a little sore.      </li>
            <li>The 1050, 1060, and 1090 all operate the same, they just have a different display: none is better than the other, and don&#x27;t waste money on the Cleaner accessory.  </li>
            <li>The Norelco replacement heads are about 30% more expensive than Braun&#x27;s Series 5, and 8000 series, although the new \\&quot;cassette\\&quot; system with the Pulsonic is about the same.  </li>
            <li>The Norelco replacement heads are about 30% more expensive than Braun&#x27;s Series 5, and 8000 series, although the new \\&quot;cassette\\&quot; system with the Pulsonic is about the same.  </li>
            <li>I am NOT a dry shave guy.  </li>
            <li>You can get as good of shave with a 9170XL SpeedXL which has the same cutting head technology and gain the comfort and save $120.</li>
            <li>It takes constant use for a few weeks to get one&#x27;s skin used to an electric razor, including this one, but well worth it.</li>
            <li>I have a \\&quot;tough\\&quot; beard and it has also performed well after a two day beard growth; takes a little longer but a pretty close shave.  </li>
            <li>The representative was very polite and helpful,and I explained the problem,and admitted to having lost the receipt,and he STILL said that they&#x27;re replace it right away,if I would agree to send the broken one to them promptly,postage prepaid by THEM.</li>
            <li>Just cant imagine the stupidity of the designers and can&#x27;t understand the simple reason as to why they would change a good size trimmer from previous versions to an obscure one which does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>Shave is not very close, no better than my 1999 Panasonic which is still using its original head; trimmer is less than useful; on the plus side, it is very quiet.</li>
            <li>It takes a long time to get a complete shave.  </li>
            <li>Second, it barely traps clippings.  </li>
            <li>I own a 9160xl and was disappointed on its performance so after explaining that to a norelco service rep the only info they had provided was how I can get a closer shave, which i was aware of.</li>
            <li>The first few days to week with the electric</li>
            <li>In the first few minutes, the shaver gets the bulk of the whiskers; the remaining time is trying to get a closer shave.  </li>
            <li>Got this one and the first thing I noticed was that the power cord would not directly fit into the shaver.  </li>
            <li>The instructions call for rinsing in hot water; a waste of energy.  </li>
            <li>The new Norelco is lighter than the others which seems to require pressing harder with it to get a closer shave.  </li>
            <li>It also achieves a very close shave in less time than the Norelco.  </li>
            <li>It also achieves a very close shave in less time than the Norelco.  </li>
            <li>It gave me a much smoother and closer shave with less chafing and discomfort.</li>
            <li>However, the Arcitec stands out by having a very distinctive slender look, the triple head surface on a flat conical piece that is affixed to a pivot, unlike the \\&quot;neckless\\&quot; other models.  </li>
            <li>It looks very high-tech with its articulated heads, but the bottom line is it shaves no better than my old model.</li>
            <li>Although electronics tend to die early, or last a long time.      </li>
            <li>I graduated to a 5885XL a long time ago and was surprised of the whisper quiet shave it delivered.  </li>
            <li>I need peace and quiet at those early hours, and this would not work long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The pivoting heads conform to the lines of my face quite well, however the razor leaves many long hairs behind.  </li>
            <li>The thing about my old razor is that it had floating heads and it handled long hairs pretty well if I was lazy and didn&#x27;t shave.</li>
            <li>My husband is older and every other electric shaver he  ever used always left his skin red and irrateded.   </li>
            <li>When I first used it, the razor was horrible and gave me a huge rash without really shaving very close.</li>
            <li>I am not about to spent [...] on a new head that may only last another 6 months.</li>
            <li>It does not conform that well to my head, but the first time I used it I could feel and hear it cutting better than any of the other Norelco&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I also appreciated the little suction cups at the bottom of the charging stand that add to its stability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also appreciated the little suction cups at the bottom of the charging stand that add to its stability.    </li>
            <li>The only reason I can&#x27;t give this 5 stars, is because of how noisy it is... just a little too much for the morning.  </li>
            <li>However, they are close to what I would get when using a new blade and had to be very careful to prevent gouging my face.      </li>
            <li>This one looks good but performs bad.  </li>
            <li>I read all the bad reviews, then read the good ones and bought it.  </li>
            <li>I read several reviews after it was orded some good and some bad</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> &quot; but Amazon was best.  </li>
            <li> Of the \\&quot;three discs\\&quot; type shavers, I think this one is the best because of the way the head articulates.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve always been impressed with Philips quality.</li>
            <li> I have been a longtime user of electric shavers, having settled on Norelco as providing the best for my needs.</li>
            <li> It looks like it can just slip-slide across your chin and neck with the greatest of ease.</li>
            <li> I still cannot get the best shave over the area between my mouth and my chin...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy I made the decision to go with this product.  </li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s the best shaver I have ever had, I  would recommend it highley.</li>
            <li> This shaver gives me the best shave for an electric shaver I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Is it perfect?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for over 25 years, and while this one isn&#x27;t the best I&#x27;ve owned, it is close.</li>

            <li> Best Norelco razor that I have owned, and I have been using electric razors since I started shaving.  </li>
            <li> This razor is not the best, as so indicated by a variety of consumer reports.  </li>
            <li> But after 1 week I am very happy with it.                           </li>
            <li> Received this arcitec at Christmas, for 30 days I thought what a great razor!</li>
            <li> I had tried a number of the Braun style shavers and they just ripped me up, yet others will swear that they are the best you can buy.</li>
            <li> Actauly I can say that Philips Norelco are the best electric shaver i had found.&lt;br /&gt;I have been used them for over 10 years,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Norelco shaver all my life, this is the best one yet!</li>
            <li> This Electric Shaver is the very best shaving and ease of cleaning it after shaving experience I have ever had.    </li>

            <li> I think this is the best.</li>

            <li> I am giving it 3 stars since it was easier to use on contours and that Norelco customer service was excellent.</li>
            <li> It is especially good on the neck.  </li>
            <li> SPF-15 in it the best.</li>
            <li> The best I ever had was a panasonic</li>
            <li> The razor worked great on the beard on my face, but NOT AT ALL on the hair that grows under my chin!  </li>
            <li> Great product!</li>
            <li> The product is perfect.</li>

            <li> however it comes incredibly close.</li>

            <li> I just bought a Panasonic ES8043SC Pro-Curve razor as a replacement - it works great</li>
            <li> (#2 was great and</li>
            <li> And it is great about trapping the whisker debris (I shave before I get dressed,</li>
            <li> And it is great about trapping the whisker debris (I shave before I get dressed,</li>
            <li> Turns out that this shaver works great for me and my beard.  </li>
            <li> Great technology there, Philips.  </li>
            <li> Great design, but not too close-cut</li>
            <li> It would be great with these adjustments.</li>
            <li> I just used the arcitec  1050 great shave.</li>

            <li> Over all a great electric.  </li>
            <li> and whenever I break it out of retirement, and it still does a great job, even with worn out blades.    </li>
            <li> Great product.    </li>
            <li> He also is happy with the trimmer that is part of this razor.  </li>
            <li> -Looks very nice  </li>
            <li> The shape made it very comfortable to hold,and gave excellent control.</li>
            <li> And most imported is the quality of shave, which I am very happy with.  </li>
            <li> one more perfect shaver from Philips, I like it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is beyond a shadow of a doubt the best razor norelco has ever made, and I have used many of them over the years.  </li>
            <li> The lithium ion battery is the latest and best battery technology.  </li>
            <li> The NORELCO Arcitec 1050 provides an excellent shave, cleans easily under running sink faucet.</li>
            <li> After the forth week on that blade I could not get a good shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good looking shaver, too.  </li>
            <li> He just loves it and would reccomend it to  anyone wanting a good shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the hype, the review, &amp; the good name of the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> Considering the price tag and sleek design, I figured I was in for a good shave.  </li>
            <li> Takes longer to get a good, close shave.    </li>
            <li> TheBraun shavers don&#x27;t provide as good as a shave from my experience</li>
            <li> Its really good.</li>
            <li> Good product, but don&#x27;t believe the \\&quot;lift and cut\\&quot; rhetoric.</li>
            <li> To some degree, is anything as good as it used to be, I don&#x27;t know?  </li>
            <li> Just not as good I expected/hoped from product description and reviews.  </li>
            <li> The razor does do a good job when I&#x27;ve already trimmed my hair</li>
            <li> Good luck if you buy a Norelco arcitec 1050.</li>
            <li> It delivers results virtually as close as a blade, and sometimes I think it is just as good.  </li>
            <li> and I wanted to get the Norelco because I had heard good things about it.    </li>
            <li> For people who like to shave after they&#x27;ve gotten dressed, that&#x27;s good news for Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parts</li>
            <li> For people who like to shave after they&#x27;ve gotten dressed, that&#x27;s good news for Norelco.      </li>
            <li> It is good they gave you two.    </li>
            <li> The shave is a good, close shave.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is fair.  </li>
            <li> A good razor, a good shave.</li>
            <li> Plus,so light and so ergonomically perfect in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The norelco arcitec 1050 works great and does what it is supposed to do which is give a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> The arcitec is much superior to the low-range model that I used before.  </li>
            <li> To summarize, I feel this is the best electric shaver available.</li>
            <li> good :&lt;</li>
            <li> I have to go over each area over and over and over and over literally and still not get a good shave,</li>
            <li> I also decided to shave my head, and the Norelco did a good job of conforming to my head.</li>
            <li> It also gives a closer shave than the others, but not as good as a foil shaver or a blade.    </li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t work for Norelco, just want to stand up for Norelco since I feel it is a good product.  </li>
            <li> and I was hoping it would be as good as the commercials touted it to be.</li>
            <li> B001AMRQ2W Norelco SpeedXL]] and loved it.</li>
            <li> This is a good looking razor, but that is about it.</li>
            <li> The shaver is a good value</li>
            <li> It looks good</li>
            <li> The shave to the neck is not that good</li>
            <li> This Norelco would probably be a good razor to keep in the car or office.</li>
            <li> Holds charge good  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t make the mistake of buying this shaver for its \\&quot;good looks.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> it had a good shaver performance</li>
            <li> shaver also can give you about 16 good shaves per charge.  </li>
            <li> you are good for two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It also looks good.</li>
            <li> Good product!!!&lt;br /&gt;HW,</li>
            <li> On the favorable side, the razor does a good job.</li>
            <li> had a Norelco razor for around 12 years and loved it</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut good and leaves hairs everywhere.  </li>
            <li> I hear good things about Braun foil shavers and will probably purchase one of these.  </li>
            <li> After using the Norelco arcitec 1050 exclusively for a month I was still having rasor burn and not getting a good shave on my neck.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade, but if you change out the shaving heads every six to 12 months, you will get a consistantly good shave.</li>
            <li> but when I spend $200 dollars I just don&#x27;t want something that looks good</li>
            <li> and since I like to have a real clean shave I end up using my razor once in a while to finish the job!    </li>
            <li> CoolSkin 8040X which I use exclusively in the shower with Nivea for Men shaving gel, and it provides an exceptionally close shave with no irritation for my skin/beard type.</li>
            <li> Best of all, the price  with the super saver shipping, beat all others I researched.</li>
            <li> the best way I came up with  was to use a container with a sealable lid and fill it halfway with very hot water.</li>
            <li> This is a very elegant looking shave, but it doesn&#x27;t excel.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco shavers for many years and was happy with them.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the Norelco arcitec shaver.</li>
            <li> I have used this for two weeks and am very pleased with the shaver.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Final note the Arcitec is great bathroom decoration and is better suited in the Sharper Image catalog than as a Philips Norelco product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very satisfied after 3+ years.</li>
            <li> I have waited the recommended 21 days before writing this review and I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the razor and included travel case.</li>
            <li> I was able to return the Arcitec and am really happy with this Braun 9595 model.</li>

            <li> Its a good razor, i liked it, but i bought this razor in february thinking that i will get $40 off.</li>
            <li> I liked it, but I had to use the shave talc stick to get a good shave</li>
            <li> Works perfectly and the price is right.</li>
            <li> It is light, stylish and the trimmer you all complain about is awesome.</li>
            <li> Norelco/Phillips Model 1050 Shaver is an outstanding product!   </li>
            <li> what&#x27;s not to love!  </li>
            <li> then that I love this razor!</li>
            <li> I must say, they have done a better job!</li>
            <li> The tactile feel of closeness is as good as a blade shave for me and very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I bought the Braun series 7, liking the look and reviews of it and found it did a nice job on my face</li>
            <li> It also comes with a really nice travel case that also plugs into the charger so you don&#x27;t need to remove it from the case to charge.  </li>
            <li> It may be louder, but it has a nice weight to it and is easier to grip.  </li>
            <li> It may be louder, but it has a nice weight to it and is easier to grip.  </li>
            <li> The beauty lays in the eye catching design and craftsmanship found in the shaver</li>
            <li> You have to buy one of the two top of the line Norelco models to get the good heads</li>
            <li> I still pull my skin in all kind of directions and run the shaver in all kinds of directions just like I did with the blade.  </li>
            <li> I own this shaver for over a year now.</li>
            <li> It has a good, comfortable feel when in use and gives me a good shave.  </li>
            <li> This razor is nice.  </li>
            <li> It looks sleek and has a nice stand.  </li>
            <li> how anyone could say otherwise is beyond me, well, to each his own</li>
            <li> I guess, what kind of mugs do you</li>
            <li> The pop up trimmer cant be used without catching your hair in the shaver</li>
            <li> My son said he liked this, he is still using it, it has been about a year now.</li>
            <li> I own the top-end Braun shaver (\\&quot;Series 9\\&quot; or something like that).  </li>
            <li> A nice feature of this razor is the tube trimmer.</li>
            <li> It does come with a nice travel case and charging stand as well.</li>
            <li> It does come with a nice travel case and charging stand as well.</li>
            <li> It does have a nice beard and mustach trimmer that flips out.</li>
            <li> I bought two of this kind of products for my father and my husband.</li>
            <li> But I liked it.</li>
            <li> Very nice shaver, Easy to clean and gives a great shave.         </li>
            <li> The razor provides a very nice close shave smooth shave for me.  </li>
            <li> My first Norelco did not have the newer heads that conform to your face, and while I got a good shave, it wasn&#x27;t great.  </li>
            <li> Great, innovative, light, maneuverable, and incredibly effective.  </li>
            <li> This new razor gives me the best shaves I have ever had.  </li>
            <li> My husband has used electric razors for many years and says this Philips norelco is absolutely the best he has encountered.  </li>
            <li> Cheers, happy shavingne minute quick shave in the evening.</li>
            <li> It looks so good and is advertised as their newest and best, but sadly, it&#x27;s not a shaver worth keeping.</li>
            <li> Great shaver very light super space age design very easy to use.</li>
            <li> He says it is, by far, the best shaver he has ever owned.  </li>
            <li> That turned out to be one of the things he liked most.  </li>
            <li> I have used Norelco shavers for 30 years and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> With this shaver, I can go in a circular motion, much more easily catching the whiskers on any part of my face or neck.  </li>
            <li> Consistently performs a perfect shave with fantastic speed and ease of operation.</li>
            <li> This one shaves fairly closely; gives a pretty good shave.  </li>
            <li> but if you know what to expect from an electric shaver and understand that real-world miracles are very rare, then a 5 star may be the fair rating.</li>

            <li> On the plus side - the shaving head is very good and offers a nice close shave.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is nice to have, and works OK and is better than nothing.    </li>
            <li> It is much better built, it feels better in the hand and the trimmer is amazing.</li>
            <li> Good clean shave, every nook and cranny</li>
            <li> but I was able to successfully and quickly trim my mustache.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty med beard and it works great.</li>
            <li> either so I can grow a full beard with good coverage.</li>
            <li> This razor is very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> The unit is very light and comes with a stand and a travel case.</li>
            <li> Very smooth.</li>
            <li> The shaver is very smooth and glides over my face.</li>
            <li> Then I feel my head very smooth, with almost no hair</li>
            <li> The shaver works well and is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> The Arcitec&#x27;s body shape makes for a very comfortable grip while shaving.</li>
            <li> The Arcitec&#x27;s body shape makes for a very comfortable grip while shaving.</li>
            <li> It cut quickly and did a good job.</li>
            <li> Very very close shave on the face and chin!!!</li>
            <li> What a huge mistake!</li>
            <li> I read many reviews before this purchase and still bought the product despite the crappy reviews.</li>
            <li> Most have been Norelcos.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco shavers for many years.</li>
            <li> Norelco says to keep using it, that performance gets better with time, but I&#x27;m not seeing it</li>
            <li> You will not be able to throw this in a breifcase and go.  </li>
            <li> unless you just like the novelty and asthetics - look for a more practical razor.</li>
            <li> I would recommend that if you are buying this shaver, make sure you can return it if you need to.</li>
            <li> It does okay</li>
            <li> For more than 24 hours of stubble, I have to break out the shave cream and disposable razors.  </li>
            <li> Oh and the sleek design that cuts neck hair better?  </li>
            <li> Any Norelco is better than this one.  </li>
            <li> Sleeker, more style.    </li>
            <li> My toothbrush has a more thought out charging system.</li>
            <li> Can someone please design and build a better electric razor?     </li>
            <li> Does the 1050X seem better built?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 44 and having been shaving for over 2 decades, been through many units.  </li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> and most of the time I need to run one of those over the spots on my neck that the arcitec misses.  </li>
            <li> so I thought more money might be better.      </li>
            <li> Nothing about it is better than my 5 years ago</li>
            <li> no matter how many passes you make.</li>
            <li> On top of this, the chambers don&#x27;t hold hair clippings so they shoot out of the razor and all over the user.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying more for Christmas gifts.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product but it doesn&#x27;t really work that well for me.  </li>
            <li> I find I&#x27;m able to get almost as close as a blade.  </li>
            <li> The last time I tried one was about 10 years ago, and I wasn&#x27;t impressed.  </li>
            <li> With the latest Arcitec design, I figured it was time to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Arcitec Models</li>
            <li> Even still, for every minute the shaver is plugged in, that is how many minutes of shaving you get.  </li>
            <li> I do two more passes and check the smoothness again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Better, but not as close as the Braun.  </li>
            <li> I found that after using the shaver for a couple of weeks and getting used to how it works, I&#x27;m able to match the Braun in closeness.  </li>
            <li> The Norelco looks better on the bathroom counter, no doubt about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> do two more passes and check the smoothness again.    </li>
            <li> Better, but not as close as the Braun.  </li>
            <li> I found that after using the shaver for a couple of weeks and getting used to how it works, I&#x27;m able to match the Braun in closeness.  </li>
            <li> The Norelco looks better on the bathroom counter, no doubt about it.      </li>
            <li> He is absolutely in love with every feature that this product has.</li>
            <li> The shavers you made twenty years ago were of better quality.</li>
            <li> and I use it for more than two weeks, shaving once a day.</li>
            <li> After using it for a year I bought a $35 Norleco at Walmart and got a better shave.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m getting better shaves.  </li>
            <li> Whoever made it went more for design than practicality.</li>
            <li> Since using the electric, my wife said she thinks my face looks better</li>
            <li> I am sure that these will corrode soon as will make additional problems with changing.  </li>
            <li> It caused many razor burns and made skin breakout.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had read more reviews (not just online, but also on Amazon) before purchasing this razor.     </li>
            <li> OK, they said wait 21 days.</li>
            <li> After about four weeks now, the rash is better and my face is adjusting.</li>
            <li> The instructions say to go in circles against the grain, but it works better if you just go against the grain in strokes.</li>
            <li> I am getting 25 shaves per recharge, better than advertised.    </li>
            <li> I bought a mustache trimmer, which works much much better than any razor&#x27;s trimmer.  </li>
            <li> But there are more electronics in the Arcitec than in my car.  </li>
            <li> And make sure you shave BEFORE you put on a shirt, because you&#x27;ll be wearing all the hair it doesn&#x27;t seem to hold in.  </li>
            <li> So I reluctantly bought the 1050, figuring if Norelco&#x27;s top of the line doesn&#x27;t cut it</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ll just quite my job and join ZZ Top.    </li>
            <li> In fact, the more I get used to the design features, it may eventually take the top spot.</li>
            <li> and I have had many.</li>
            <li> I love the way the head glides.  </li>
            <li> I shave every 2 days so this shaver is perfect for my stubble (I find daily shaving to be irritable).  </li>
            <li> I have used mostly electric razors of many kinds to avoid the nicks I sometimes got with non-electric shavers.</li>
            <li> I owned a Philips Norelco shaver that cost much more than this model (purchased Dec 2008).  </li>
            <li> However, even at more than twice the price the</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Philips shavers for probably over 15 years, I fell in love with them from the start....</li>
            <li> I am quite satisfied with my purchase of this product.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this weeks ago and still don&#x27;t have it so still waiting will write more when get it</li>
            <li> Cannot understand why this type of razor wasn&#x27;t invented many years ago.  </li>
            <li> Always pleased.  </li>
            <li> More than a day or two</li>
            <li> and I could never shave more than once</li>
            <li> A Satisfied Customer</li>
            <li> ( I have used the shave for more than 20 days so this isnt a biased review )</li>
            <li> It looks great, feels good in your hand and is pleasantly quiet, but that&#x27;s it.   </li>
            <li> and in fact misses more hair that it should around the neck.</li>
            <li> it doesnt reach the top of ny moustache/bottom of my nose.</li>
            <li> I bought this because its the top of the line</li>
            <li> I have used the 1050 now for 4 weeks, and i have to make way too many passes with the thing to get my neck sufficiently.</li>
            <li> Which, in the process gives me more irritated skin after shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a electric foil razor user for many years.  </li>
            <li> Some were better than others, but none even begins to compare  to this piece of junk.</li>
            <li> It misses about twice as  many under the jaw line.</li>
            <li> Oh and don&#x27;t worry, no one will be able to miss that you look like you had a blindfolded 3 year  </li>
            <li> but it is much better than what they give you.    </li>
            <li> the shaver and do not allow it to charge for greater than 1 hour\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I guess I can go get a $20 timer and plug it into that to make sure.</li>
            <li> I have tested many brands of electric shavers over the decades</li>
            <li> Love the color    </li>
            <li> I really did get the sense that it just wasn&#x27;t designed to give a great shave.</li>
            <li> It really isn&#x27;t all that great.</li>
            <li> then it is better to stick to just using a blade.     </li>
            <li> I like it much better than any of its predecesors.    </li>
            <li> I read most of the reviews posted here</li>
            <li> The trimmer does seem a bit under powered and does work better when you pop off the razor head.</li>
            <li> can say that the Artic has a better design</li>
            <li> am sure is quite better but how much better...</li>
            <li> I actually look forward to shaving with it, IT IS THAT GOOD!!!</li>
            <li> If that is the case I am sure glad that I have been a Braun user.</li>
            <li> I have used electric shavers for many years.</li>
            <li> Thank you Norelco and thank you Amazon for the best price for this magic facial hair removing instrument.    </li>
            <li> Overall I believe this is an excellent shaver for the price.</li>
            <li> No matter how many passes you take, it will miss some hairs.</li>
            <li> I love this unit and it suits me well.</li>
            <li> , I wanted to love using this shaver.</li>
            <li> Gosh, I wanted to love using this shaver.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe that this one might work better for my adam&#x27;s apple</li>
            <li> so I bought this one to compare (with the 45-day return policy at the top of my mind).  </li>
            <li> Braun is better, as most of the reviews and surveys said.  </li>
            <li> - it digs in where this one seems to glide over the top.  </li>
            <li> It does the best job in following the curvature of your face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK for sideburns</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not even sure I have shaved.  </li>
            <li> but did the job better than this Arcitec razor.  </li>
            <li> The best shave I got was after I changed the blades out but only lasted a month.  </li>
            <li> and I am therefore pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- Super-protective (for travel mostly)</li>
            <li> is one of Arcitec&#x27;s better features.</li>
            <li> feature most of us buy a shaver for :)...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, for an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> The 8140XL was okay</li>
            <li> Norleco claim that the Arcitec has \\&quot;50% more shaving surface\\</li>
            <li> ask myself \\&quot;50% more than what?\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not going to say more because everyone can see the images posted on Amazon&#x27;s page.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not so sure the bulkiness is justified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I love it) stars.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not going to say more because everyone can see the images posted on Amazon&#x27;s page.</li>
            <li> (I like it) and 5 (I love it) stars.</li>
            <li> I was always concerned when Phillips bought this company that they would try to make the razor more of a Phillips style razor</li>
            <li> but they made it better.</li>
            <li> and the latest has better reviews.</li>
            <li> I am liking this razor more and more every time I use it.  </li>
            <li> and it has brought me to three conclusions: 1) You can&#x27;t please everyone but you CAN please most 2)</li>
            <li> The nature of lithium ion and lithium polymer batteries is that they CAN&#x27;T be over charged, they have no burn in memory, and are safe to leave in the charge at all times.</li>
            <li> OK in the shower.</li>
            <li> I read with interest, the most favorable review for this shaver.</li>
            <li> Better to suggest that the Phillips/Norelco engineers should take a crack at a better design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After my 3 years of use, it&#x27;s cost me well more than twice</li>
            <li> and the hype is should work a lot better.</li>
            <li> Does most of what it says.  </li>
            <li> It feels nice and comfortable in the hand.</li>
            <li> I love Norelco&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> and you have to go over areas many times.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco for many years,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Norelco user for 30 plus years, love their quality of product and shave.</li>
            <li> This latest Arcitec with its lack of replacable blades is why this company should go under.  </li>
            <li> guess is many of the good reviews are being written by persons who have not had the pleasure of trying one of Norelco&#x27;s older shavers to notice the amazing quality they can provide.</li>
            <li> My guess is many of the good reviews are being written by persons who have not had the pleasure of trying one of Norelco&#x27;s older shavers to notice the amazing quality they can provide.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but I felt VERY strongly about warning fellow loyal Norelco customers!</li>
            <li> What ever happened to the older heavier models with a great trimmer and  </li>
            <li> For the price I thought it would work great since I had heard that high end electrics work well.  </li>
            <li> it is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> The shaver stays nice and cool to the touch.</li>
            <li> If you want a good, close shave that doesn&#x27;t irritate, I wouldn&#x27;t make this the first on your list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First off, this is a good looking shaver.</li>
            <li> I also find the reservoir to be quite adequate in catching the shavings.  </li>
            <li> Surprisingly, the shave is as good as my regular razor blade.</li>
            <li> With a very cool design, nice grip and feel, and nice plastic travel case, I really wanted to like it.  </li>
            <li> Certainly, the accessories are more impressive than what Braun offers.</li>
            <li> The most important thing...</li>
            <li> This is the primary reason why I love this razor.  </li>
            <li> it has a cool feature how each head moves on its own to try and fit your face as you shave.  </li>
            <li> The Arcitec razor offers a great shave; I don&#x27;t get 3 o&#x27;clock shadow until about 7 pm.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not so sure the bulkiness is justified.    </li>
            <li> -what is with that-am I becoming mutant?</li>
            <li> The pluses: Battery life is great if you wait until the battery is nearly fully discharged as the manufacturer recommends.  </li>
            <li> I thought \\&quot;hey, it costs so much, it must be good, maybe I just need to get used to it.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> It appears to me that most reviewers do not take into account that when it comes to (high end) electric razors, the question as to whether a machine is \\&quot;good\\&quot; or \\&quot;bad\\&quot; does mostly depend on one&#x27;s own biological physiognomy, and not on the particularities of the brand.</li>
            <li> The travel case should me more user friendly.</li>
            <li> Cleaning the thing is really easy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean and easy top use.</li>
            <li> It cleans up easily under the tap.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning is easy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s neat and easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> They fill  up very quickly and then begin to puke the cut hair all over whatever you are standing over while  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry, it is just as easy as running it under the faucet</li>
            <li> It is easy for caregivers to use and he can even use it himself at times.</li>
            <li> (lasts for 2-3 weeks easy).  </li>
            <li> Easy clean-up too.</li>
            <li> but you have to clean more often.</li>
            <li> The heads clog very quickly.</li>
            <li> I would strongly suggest looking elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> , I strongly recommend the 6863 XC model.</li>
            <li> While the shaver looks good, it has NEVER delivered a close shave-not even a decent shave.</li>
            <li> In fact, from what I now know, I would strongly recommend not buying any Norelco products.</li>
            <li> They all liked the product very much.</li>
            <li> -Is very clean while shaving and easy to clean up    Cons:  </li>
            <li> It was a comfortable shave but took me a good five minutes to get that real close &#x27;blade&#x27; smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> The natural question then is, what kind of architects designed this arcitec?!</li>
            <li> other wise its a good razor.</li>
            <li> I was all set to purchase my own, but decided to take his out for a spin first.</li>
            <li> I must say it&#x27;s hands down the best.  </li>
            <li> I have been hearing lots of really good things about this new razor Norelco has advertised.</li>
            <li> Quite frankly, the 1050 is just fine.  </li>
            <li> you dont need three models 1050/1090 would be fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fine piece of work.  </li>
            <li> I did replace the heads and now it works fine.</li>
            <li> I replaced it with a Norelco 8240XL which is excellent and half the price.    </li>
            <li> I guess for some others it works fine but considering the price</li>
            <li> yes this shaver looks awesome, after you hold it you can tell right away its a lot lighter and fits much better in your hands that the other Philips</li>
            <li> It looks nice and has nice features, but I think its functionality isn&#x27;t worth the high price tag.</li>
            <li> Slap a little Lectric Shave on my face and away the 1050 goes giving me the best, closest shave I have ever gotten with any electric razor (Norelco, Braun, Remington, etc.).  </li>
            <li> It was love at first shave!  </li>
            <li> My husband who is 78 was very pleased to receive this highly advertisied shaver.</li>
            <li> 60 Day free trial sounds like the way to go.</li>
            <li> Cleaning is simple and battery life is great.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this to all that want a close and comfortable shave every time.  </li>
            <li> It can give me a smooth shave</li>
            <li> Charger doesn&#x27;t fit in travel case.    </li>
            <li> I do not like the cheap trimmer.  </li>
            <li> nothing wrong with it - it just seemed nice to upgrade to the latest and greatest.)</li>
            <li> Anyone want a free used Norelco Arcitec???</li>
            <li> It feels comfortable.</li>
            <li> , the flaw--unfortunately--is in it&#x27;s primary purpose, which is, as a shaver.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but felt that this was important for people to know.</li>
            <li> but now I am getting comfortable shaves.  </li>
            <li> It still took up to 30 minutes to get a shave I was comfortable with.  </li>
            <li> His skin was irritated for a two days after and did not even get close to a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> This shaver affords men the closest and light weight shaver that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> SOOOO smooth and comfortable.</li>
            <li> The fact that P/N warranty terminates after the initial unit is replaced is not making me a happy P/N customer.</li>
            <li> They also recommend running the razor in a sink filled with soapy water.  </li>
            <li> It also comes with a great travel/charge \\&quot;pod\\&quot; that should protect the razor from everything short of a nuclear blast.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Seems like something that should&#x27;ve been available in the 90&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Great to finally shave with electric and no longer feel roughness under chin on the front of my throat!  </li>
            <li> The shaving result itself is not quite as smooth as with a 5 blade Gillete, but it comes close.</li>
            <li> I have a light beard, and use a pre shave lotion, and this razor makes face feel like a baby&#x27;s butt.  </li>
            <li> The 1050 holds a charge for a while and does clean fairly easily</li>
            <li> The Arcitec 1050 is comfortable, butter smooth, and cuts as close as a blade.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ergonomic and fits well in my hands; comfortable to hold while shaving.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t pinch or cut me but the sound of it made me think that it  had.      </li>
            <li> Light weight  </li>
            <li> It truly shaves every nook and cranny of your face with a light touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is fairly comfortable to hold</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> but it sounds cheap</li>
            <li> It shaves close around all areas of the face and neck and leaves the skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> The shave is close and smooth.</li>
            <li> I had to switch back to my Norelco Spectra razor, which wasn&#x27;t great</li>
            <li> If the trimmer is important to you, this is not the product you want.  </li>
            <li> A great improvement over the standard Norelco where 1, 2 or 3 of the cutter heads are used in varying combinations.    </li>
            <li> Believ Philips is doing a great job in their constant development of their shavers.</li>
            <li> Norelco went back to more diagonal openings with this model, which is good.  </li>
            <li> However it is not as good as my old Braun 7505.</li>
            <li> It absolutely does not shave as close as it claims!!!</li>
            <li> This razor is a work of art -- exceptional styling and quality of fit and finish as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li> Many of the reviews tout how much better this is than the older Norelcos.</li>
            <li> And to get it to get as close as I can get, it takes WAY longer than my older Norelco, needing MANY more passes.  </li>
            <li> It is built solid, has an amazing battery life, and shaves pretty good.  </li>
            <li> I have never had a clean smooth shave with this razor.  </li>
            <li> You end up with a clean but comfortable shave every time.</li>
            <li> It gives a close shave quickly and comfortably and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> The 1050 handles it all, smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> It shaves quickly, close and easily.  </li>
            <li> and it charges very quickly (one hour, with a quick charge for emergencies).    </li>
            <li> razor took the beard off with very little force and the best part is the way the heads conform to the chin</li>
            <li> Quick, smooth, effect, close, comfortable.      </li>
            <li> To be honest, I can&#x27;t find anything that is a distinct positive about this product.</li>
            <li> :it certainly looks very cool, it is light and easy to handle, not</li>
            <li> It is still operating on its original charge; 11 days and eleven shaves.  </li>
            <li> It has a great battery and lasts for a long time without needing a recharge.  </li>
            <li> I make a full double-pass across my face, then check the smoothness with my free hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First, I cut myself getting the damn thing out of the plastic packaging, I tried not to let that color my views :)    </li>
            <li> This is the first micro-screen razor I have used and it is better in all respects to the Norelco Arcitec except for the fancy styling.  </li>
            <li> This is the first micro-screen razor I have used and it is better in all respects to the Norelco Arcitec except for the fancy styling.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Norelco recommends that the full shaving head assembly is replaced once a year and an &#x27;replace head&#x27; indicator should light up on the shaver when that time comes</li>
            <li> This one was even better than the first.</li>
            <li> Not sure it&#x27;s the best razor they have ever made, but with refinements and tweaks</li>
            <li> Immediately, I noticed that the original head was smoother, closer and faster.</li>
            <li> I also own a new generation</li>
            <li> Kind of like a Saturday Night Live skit in the 70&#x27;s</li>
            <li> B000VXJYCQ Philips Norelco Arcitec 1050 Rechargeable Cordless Razor + Accessory Kit]][[ASIN:B004AWDPEC Norelco/Philips Arcitec Rechargeable Men&#x27;s Shaver with Jet Clean System]]</li>
            <li> However, this one is easier to clean and use and he finds that it gives him a truly close shave.</li>
            <li> I clean and maintain it meticulously</li>
            <li> The ARCITEC gives the closest shaves and is easier to clean than others.  </li>
            <li> I use a disposable to clean up after everytime I use the arcitec.</li>
            <li> Now after you clean the bathroom sink (or wherever you were) of all the puked hair, you still get  to clean the razor.</li>
            <li> you can not take the cutters out of the combs  and clean them.</li>
            <li> I used foaming bathroom cleaner to clean it.</li>
            <li> Might as well use  what you have and with this razor you are going to use a lot of that anyway to clean up all of the  puked hair.    </li>
            <li> It is easier to clean.  </li>
            <li> We currently own the Philips Norelco 7340 Men&#x27;s Shaving System and were Ok with the overall shaving experience.</li>
            <li> Negitive&#x27;s    Don&#x27;t like to clean after each shave, but it is a must.  </li>
            <li> Opening all 3 of the razor heads to clean each one and then \\&quot;snapping\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Easier to clean</li>
            <li> my old Norelco died, I was thrilled to see this technologically advanced shaver.  </li>
            <li> The shaver tells you when to clean and when to charge.</li>
            <li> He was very well pleased with the shaver, and when he filled out the warranty information online, he got a coupon for a discount on another Norelco shaving product.</li>
            <li> No amount of rinsing in the water will clean the Arcitec heads.</li>
            <li> I should be able to plug the unit in directly and not have to lug around more junk to lose or break while on travel.</li>
            <li> I should be able to plug the unit in directly and not have to lug around more junk to lose or break while on travel.</li>
            <li> Flip the cover and try to clean it.</li>
            <li> I bought him this razor for an early Christmas present, and the results are excellent.</li>
            <li> From the first shave I absolutely love this shaver, it gives the closest shave and by far the most comfortable shave of all the high end electric shavers I have ever owned, and I have owned many!</li>
            <li> The older Norelco cut fine and the blades lasted more than a year.  </li>
            <li> The battery life is excellent between shaves, other than that it really is an inferior product.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still kicking myself for not buying this when it came out as a special deal...</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s more, my old Norelco still has its original blades!</li>
            <li> Being able to clean with water without taking apart is a real plus.</li>
            <li> The new 8240 is very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> I traveled on airlines with it twice,using the included hard travel case/recharger,and it came through it perfectly.</li>
            <li> After the second week I found I had to scrub my face with the razor to get a good shave.</li>
            <li> After purchasing this one, I passed on my \\&quot;cool skin\\&quot; to my cousin which still works</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco shavers my entire life with good results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel that I need to use a blade to get a close shave any more, and  I&#x27;m really amazed by the results.  </li>
            <li> The true test of a razor is how well it shaves, and the biggest challenge to me is in the neck area.  </li>
            <li> So when my last one needed replacing, I decided to get a really good one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m keeping my day job (much to the relief of ZZ Top fans everywhere).</li>
            <li> I already own an old Norelco (http://www.amazon.com/Norelco-Deluxe-Reflex-Plus-Shaver/dp/B00009RB11).</li>
            <li> my last was a spectra good shaver but always missed my neck</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ve always gotten better shaves with foil shavers, they are really noisy</li>
            <li> It comes with a satisfaction warranty, but give it the full test before you write it off.    </li>
            <li> According to the imprint on the razor, the machine is \\&quot;Made in the Netherlands\\&quot; - Hold on to your hat, if that is true:</li>
            <li> I really like this product, and with a stylish design</li>
            <li> Overall good shaver</li>
            <li> So, some might say that rating one&#x27;s results with a shaver is very subjective and that it might work for some better than it worked for me.</li>
            <li> While this might be true I have to add that picking up this shaver</li>
            <li> This my second Norelco, loved both of them.</li>
            <li> He is pleased with its performance, but does not believe it lives up to the advertising claims and the package was a real challenge to get into.</li>
            <li> Cool look.  </li>
            <li> In my case, it was worthwile to simply keep a good thing going a while longer.</li>
            <li> sum things up This razor does look cool</li>
            <li> It has more muscle and the pulsation thing seems to really work</li>
            <li> The manual claims (verified) that it can take a full charge in about one hour and, once charged.</li>
            <li> If you are simply looking for a good shave, I&#x27;d say give this a try.</li>
            <li> When was the last time you replaced the blades in an electric razor (O.K., a GOOD electric razor) for under $30?  </li>
            <li> If you think you like the functions of this razor but really aren&#x27;t sure about it, I would not recommend it because it doesn&#x27;t work like I think a razor should</li>
            <li> If you think you like the functions of this razor but really aren&#x27;t sure about it, I would not recommend it because it doesn&#x27;t work like I think a razor should</li>
            <li> I use it every day and it lasts for 3 to 4 weeks on a full charge.  </li>
            <li> I think who ever designed this razor just went for how sleek and cool they could make it look and</li>
            <li> It just won&#x27;t look as cool on your counter.  </li>
            <li> The shave is not bad on the cheeks</li>
            <li> I am so satisfied with the new Norelco that it has become my primary shaver.  </li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t use toothbrushes to clean floors because excellent results are only achieved through using the proper tools.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so easy - just flip up the blade covers and run it under hot water.</li>
            <li> The good news: Small, light, easy to handle, decent shave, Very easy to clean, cutter life.  </li>
            <li> I found a nice little Panasonic wet-dry shaver on Amazon that gives me a nice close shave and costs $30 or 1/4 of what I paid for the Phillips shaver-shame on you Phillips for selling a shaver that should just be a desk sculptue, but should never be used.</li>
            <li> and yes it shaves better than this brand new Arcitec!</li>
            <li> This razor is fantastic; fast, close comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt really smooth after, plus there were no nicks (the kind you get with regular shaving).     </li>
            <li> By the time I was done with the blade, I had a super close shave.  </li>
            <li> I had the older version and enjoyed it.    </li>
            <li> The ease of keeping it maintanied makes it a super value.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor but you should upgrade to the 1090 if your boyfriend/husband likes to have warning of how much time is left until it needs to be charged again.</li>
            <li> It is fast and comfortable, and my face feels razor smooth.  </li>
            <li> It is fast and comfortable, and my face feels razor smooth.  </li>
            <li> which served me well for all this time but, when the time came to replace the old 8140XL&#x27;s heads I happened to notice that a brand-new Arcitec was available as a &#x27;lightning deal&#x27; for some $35 more</li>
            <li> Quick start guide card&lt;</li>
            <li> I have been a loyal Norelco user since I was 21.</li>
            <li> and this can result in quick shaves.</li>
            <li> If I feel like I want to get super duper shiny close</li>
            <li> Once in a while I will give it a one minute quick shave in the evening.</li>
            <li> It fills up with hair rather quickly so maybe that has an impact on how well it shaves.</li>
            <li> Also, the quality of construction using more plastic indicates that you are forcing your customers to purchase new shaving heads on an annual basis.</li>
            <li> So I got this new razor hoping that it would be even better than the XL.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always bought the top of line Norelco whenever something new and \\&quot;better\\&quot; came out.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco razors for years, so I looked forward to this top of the line new model.</li>
            <li> I like that it is easily cleaned in the sink every morning and the heads mold very well to my face as I shave.    </li>
            <li> No matter whether I press lightly or strongly, go in circles or in straight lines, it just won&#x27;t cut that close.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several Norelco razors over the years, and up till now they&#x27;ve all been pretty good.  </li>
            <li> I would give the slight edge to the 8040X in terms of closeness and comfort, but I love both, and if you prefer shaving dry, the Arcitec 1050X is an excellent choice.</li>
            <li> It does contour to the face really well, but it just doesn&#x27;t cut my stubble easily.</li>
            <li> The 1050X is lightweight, easy to hold, and the heads move so effortlessly to the contours of my face that it&#x27;s really a pleasure to use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery:  Early, new battery life is good, as with most new battery devices.  </li>
            <li> Early, new battery life is good, as with most new battery devices.  </li>
            <li> As it turns out, I&#x27;ve owned two other Norelcos and a mid-range Braun which have proven to be dependable, well made and produce a good, clean shave.</li>
            <li> used Norelco Arcitec to any of those who have written those positive reviews cheap for $75.</li>
            <li> I was excited the first time I used it</li>
            <li> This is the first rotary shaver I&#x27;ve owned, and it is by far the most comfortable shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get as good a shave with this new shaver as I can with my old one with worn blades.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m returning it and getting the old style for half the price that I have been very happy with.</li>
            <li> It looks beautiful, the battery last a long time, and it&#x27;s easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The flexible neck and the three independent floating heads make for a very smooth, comfortable and close shave.</li>
            <li> Feels good, if a little light, in the hand, too.</li>
            <li> My husband has a \\&quot;barbed wire\\&quot; beard and finding him a razor that gives a smooth, close and fast shave has always been a challange.  </li>
            <li> Shaving with the Arcitec is comfortable, close and fast.</li>
            <li> My primary shaving method has been the razor blade, supplemented by the electric for a fast shave now and then.  </li>
            <li> I used this razor last night and it was amazing.</li>
            <li> A truly fantastic razor at a reasonable and competitive price.</li>
            <li> The razor itself shaves very close and leaves a comfortable feeling on the face.  </li>
            <li> I shave with light pressure in reverse circles to the head comb angles and then vertical and horizontal stokes when I get real close.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco arcitec 1050 Men&#x27;s Shaver gives the smoothest shave I have ever received, even better than the old fashioned shaving cream and razors!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you are a road warrior you better keep your old razor.  </li>
            <li> I only wish there   was an electric that was efficient &amp; effective.</li>
            <li> In the end I replaced the batteries and heads on my old Quadra and use it more than the 1050.</li>
            <li> Several reviews here complain about the shaver head catching their hair when using the trimmer on sideburns.</li>
            <li> I got about 30 days worth of shaving before having to recharge.</li>
            <li> Might be a good idea for something that gets wet.      </li>
            <li> i ordered Philips Norelco arcitec 1050 wondering whether its worth its price.</li>
            <li> I watched a couple of YouTube posted reviews of the latest Braun Pulsonic 9595, and that shaver sounded about as loud (if not louder) than my Braun 8595 Activator.</li>
            <li> You be your own judge as everyone beard is different.  </li>
            <li> the advantages I&#x27;m about to tell you about make it worth while.      </li>
            <li> So, getting cut to ribbons much more frequently</li>
            <li> Both appear to be cheaply made and will warp such that soon I would expect to not be able to use them.  </li>
            <li> but you have to do it after every one or two shaves or it gets harder to get a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find myself going over and over areas to the point of frustration, all the while not cutting hairs.  </li>
            <li> I went for the norelco 8200 series that was more like my old shaver in structure</li>
            <li> the motors were powerful?</li>
            <li> and I often felt that I was going to break it as I pushed it under and around my neck to try (without much success) and cut the hairs under and to the sides of my neck.   </li>
            <li> The product is not even worth 25% of its retail value as it does nothing but irritate the skin and mind.</li>
            <li> Charging stand does not offer any additional benefit and miss being able to put a cord directly into the razor.</li>
            <li> Then the fun ended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes up more room in the suitcase than my old Norelco&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I bought one of these for my teenager for Christmas, and I was envious that he was getting a Norelco that was better than the old man&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> , she confirmed my 5885xl produced a better shave, in about the same amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does require cleaning after each use but well worth it.</li>
            <li> manual, covering FOUR separate models is surprisingly well written to the extent that you are not annoyed by having to find the paragraph that applies to your specific model so, know thy model number (it&#x27;s a 1050).</li>
            <li> &quot; (compare with the old 8140XL claim of \\&quot;up to 50% more shaving surface\\&quot;)</li>
            <li> useful feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> well worth it to me and for anyone that chooses an electric over a blade.</li>
            <li> With a 60 day return policy to Norelco, it&#x27;s worth a trial run.  </li>
            <li> and wow, his face feels so smooth!  </li>
            <li> The first week I was reasonably satisfied with the new razor and the closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li> I would prefer being able to leave the plug in the shaver, rather than remove it right after the charge is complete.  </li>
            <li> I have tried the Brauns and other electric shavers over the years to look for that next and best shaver..</li>
            <li> (I prefer the feel of the original model because this is one is smaller), and looks fancy sitting on the counter, but it does not do a better job.  </li>
            <li> First, it doesn&#x27;t shave closely OR quickly.  </li>
            <li> The power/rpms were plenty enough to tackle this job with relative ease and I am still very happy with this razor and can highly recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> and you have to open each three top cover and clean them every time.</li>
            <li> but pretty close with some nice benefits that make it worth continuing to use instead of going back to a blade.</li>
            <li> All you have to do is pull the head off and you have a stand alone trimmer that is just the right size.     </li>
            <li> The size of the 5130 is just about right.  </li>
            <li> razor came right on time at a price i couldnt find anywhere</li>
            <li> I had on my right lower jaw bone (which I didn&#x27;t attribute to razor burn but thought it was a skin condition)</li>
            <li> (I think because of the bumps on the right lower jaw bone going away).  </li>
            <li> It is right at a right-angle to vertical.  </li>
            <li> , right?</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s just right for all.</li>
            <li> You can take the razor head right off and pop out the trimmer.</li>
            <li> Better yet, I was able to get a new one for only $66 on eBay.  </li>
            <li> , the first shave I got using it was incredibly close and clean, it seemed effortless, no doubt the three blades cutting on each head give a much better shave,</li>
            <li> Thankfully, I kept the old original head, and after suffering through the RQ12+ for a 45 days, replaced it with the original head that had 1 year of wear.  </li>
            <li> And since it was the most expensive razor I ever bought,I read and followed the owner&#x27;s manual very closely and took very good care of it.  </li>
            <li> I am without a doubt loyal to the norelco product but there have been other shavers which have cut closer and more comfortable to use until now.  </li>
            <li> However, let me say that it only takes about 30 seconds to rinse it under hot water, and then you are good as new.  </li>
            <li> Some of the reviews must have been written by the competition and 3) A little more attention to detail will help some of you understand the product better.    </li>
            <li> Most people are familiar with the Norelco design by now, which has different heads pivoting individually to really get the contours of your face.  </li>
            <li> Extremely close shave, very easy to use, and a breeze to clean.  </li>
            <li> So... Norelco certainly wins the prize for most quiet shaver.  </li>
            <li> So, for almost half off retail it was a good deal.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see the need to spend more for one of the models with a few more bell&#x27;s and whistles.  </li>
            <li> This is absolute baloney and, obviously, clear indications of just one more corporation that has been taken over by Greed and Deception.</li>
            <li> I very much wanted to like this razor.  </li>
            <li> Although it does look very modern</li>
            <li> Since one of the hardest things to do with a Norelco is clean it, this is a huge improvement over earlier models.    </li>
            <li> My older Norelcos were far better than this one.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but I do not want to spend this kind of money, when he can get a clean smooth shave from a cheap razor.</li>
            <li> If you do buy it, realize that the performance after 8 weeks is not going to be any different than the performance after 3, and return it if you don&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li> I returned this model and bought Norelco&#x27;s cheapest model the 7110x and its infinitely better for only a fraction of the price!</li>
            <li> We saw the advertisement for this razor on television and he was interested.  </li>
            <li> I went online and priced it at many different \\&quot;stores\\</li>
            <li> Replacement heads do not last the stated six months; three months is more like it, and they are pricey.    </li>
            <li> so I would expect it to at least have an intelligent charging system.      </li>
            <li> How many times have you had to get to work and the razor had a low battery?</li>
            <li> Get $50 off a future Amazon.com purchase when you spend $149 or more on eligible Norelco, Sonicare, Bliss Philips, and Tresemme products offered by Amazon.com, including this item.</li>
            <li> Read most of the 5 star review they only praise the looks.</li>
            <li> First, I just returned a Norelco 1050X ($190) after seeing almost no difference in shave between it and the Remington R-5130.  </li>
            <li> And, have always returned to Remington as Norelco products never did any better for the extra cash.</li>
            <li> a pretty sucky shave  </li>
            <li> but if it&#x27;s more than say... 5 or so days of growth I simply can&#x27;t use it without wasting a ton of time.     </li>
            <li> I received this Norelco as a gift when it first came on the market.  </li>
            <li> Frankly I was pretty convinced by the marketing, which claims that it&#x27;s the closest shave ever, etc etc.  </li>
            <li> Too much style and no substance!</li>
            <li> And it is more economical than blades in the long run.</li>
            <li> If you forget to empty after each shave, the contents are nicely distributed over your face and the area below.</li>
            <li> I have also used it in the shower and works pretty well in water too.    </li>
            <li> Norelco makes so many different models, I can&#x27;t figure them all out.</li>
            <li> When you encounter a hair with it, there&#x27;s a rather loud \\&quot;click\\&quot; sound.</li>
            <li> So, cost of maintenance might be higher.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what impresses me the most about the Norelco--it is very quiet.  </li>

            <li> That&#x27;s what impresses me the most about the Norelco--it is very quiet.  </li>
            <li> I never got a great shave and finally complained to customer service who told me that this was probably not the razor for me.</li>
            <li> The Norelco arcitec did not give me a close shave unless I spend many minutes going over and over the same places.  </li>
            <li> med   I almost thought the first shave was too close</li>
            <li> This was the first time I have owned an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> The Norelco 1050 is my first electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using blades since I first started shaving.  </li>
            <li> Does it give me as close a shave as I got with a blade - no, but it does get pretty close and</li>
            <li> She also thinks it feels as smooth as it did with the blade even though I can feel where the whiskers haven&#x27;t been completely eliminated.    </li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t bother getting this razor in the first place.</li>
            <li> had I not found so many others with similar experiences to mine.    </li>
            <li> The first 1050 I bought died after 18 shaves.  </li>
            <li> My next Norelco had floating heads that did a much better job.  </li>
            <li> This razor handled my 3-day growth pretty well.</li>
            <li> There are newer models of this shaver, and you should probably go with them, as I predict that they can only be better.</li>
            <li> I got the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Sure, it gives a close shave, but I have to go over and over and over the same spot to get it.</li>
            <li> After purchasing this product most of the red bumps have disappeared.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer works best when you remove the shaving head which merely pops on and off with ease.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m returning it to norelco and buying another more standard model!  </li>
            <li> You have to charge it first with either the charging case or the charging stand.  </li>
            <li> With my Braun foil razor It gives a close shave on just about the first swipe.  </li>
            <li> While this is subjective, the unit feels cheap and flimsy compared to my old Norelco.</li>
            <li> But Philips says use hot water.  </li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s okay for occasional side-burn trimming.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  bought more than 10 different Norelcos over the years.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different ways of cleaning the heads of this thing and</li>
            <li> That is many hours extra work, over the course of a year or the shaver&#x27;s lifetime.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also more solid</li>
            <li> Try one of Norelco&#x27;s cheaper models first.</li>
            <li> I use a razor brush from an older unit, brush it out quickly over the wastebasket</li>
            <li> I use a razor brush from an older unit, brush it out quickly over the wastebasket</li>
            <li> Overall this is an OK shaver.</li>
            <li> It seemed that the design of this product should yield a better shave than traditional designs</li>
            <li> Initially it took many hours to charge the battery.</li>
            <li> Also, even though the razor is cleaned after each shave, it gets hot when used.</li>
            <li> The shaver works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> The razor does exactly what I want in a razor.</li>
            <li> Although Norelco customer service is  outstanding and excellent, but 3 months is no time for a such an expensive item.  </li>
            <li> After several weeks of using it I can say that the Arcitec is &#x27;better&#x27; that the 8140XL</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not totally bullet-proof but it probably ensures that most units don&#x27;t suffer any damage while in transit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually read it and I am better off for it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but my experience with the Arcitec is that my skin tolerates it pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with my purchase and Arcitec is now my &#x27;regular&#x27; shaver.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my purchase and Arcitec is now my &#x27;regular&#x27; shaver.</li>
            <li> but for now this is just a total loss IMHO-not even sure to buy replacement blades as I just ordered the HQ9s for the 8270xl.</li>
            <li> First, everyone comments on design and style, so let&#x27;s get that out of the way.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but why pay up to $100 more for a unit that does all the same things?  </li>
            <li> My old Remington titanium R9710 was a good razor but it ripped the hair out of my neck area and left me with very irritated skin.</li>
            <li> If you want to try this product I would say go for it because Norelco has such a generous return policy and maybe you will like it better than I did.</li>

            <li> This person mentioned that this is their first electric shaver after a lifetime of using blades.</li>
            <li> I have a bit more actual experience with competing products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is not his first Norelco, but it is the first Arcitec model that he has had.</li>
            <li> The heads never stay in after you pull them out the first time (as instructed by the mfg. instructions) to replace them.</li>
            <li> First of all, it is noteworthy to understand that Norelco has discontinued ALL service operations in the US and Canada.</li>
            <li> There really was NO comparison!</li>
            <li> The motor is a bit loud; a more powerful loud.</li>
            <li> If it just shaved a little closer, and conformed a bit better to my head, it would have earned an easy 5 stars.    </li>
            <li> I have owned other Norelco razors and liked them very much, except for the problematic neck hairs.</li>
            <li> I have found that the shave is quite comfortable if you don&#x27;t overdo it - just shave until you are clean, and use an after-shave cream to avoid minor irritation.  </li>
            <li> , I honestly don&#x27;t feel that I should compare it to other models...</li>
            <li> The problem was always, that a significant amount of my hairs was either to curly or to soft to be cut efficiently by the vibrating blade of those modells.</li>
            <li> While the original Architec head shaves smoothly, fast and close, the new RQ12</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get a nice smooth line.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get a nice smooth line.</li>
            <li> They are the best blades ever, give a quick close shave and cost so much money  to replace ($28.99 msrp for 8 blades), that if I changed them out when I really should (weekly is ideal and almost necessary they go dull so fast), I will have paid for the Norelco Arcitec 1050 plus a little extra, in just one year of use.    </li>
            <li> It does clean the neck very well, plus the trimmer is a lot better than other Norelcos</li>
            <li> I have always found that wet shaving, even with my other Norelco which can do either, was WAYYY better and more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I noted before, the Arcitec is very gentle to my skin and this is the main reason, other than good looks, that I prefer it over the older model.</li>
            <li> I have come up with the conclusion that most of you work for the competition, or you would whine if someone gave you a hundred dollar bill with a wrinkle in it, or you are still trying to figure out how toilet paper works.    </li>
            <li> I have gone back to straight razors for awhile until I can find a better way.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for over a year and the battery still holds a good charge lasting over a week of daily use.</li>
            <li> I have been using those razors for the past 10 years and have had pretty good results.  </li>
            <li> I have ready many user reviews and some technical reviews on the Norelco Arcitec</li>
            <li> The head design feels better on the neck, and has not caused razor-burn if I do not stretch the skin tight like I need to with the original model.  </li>
            <li> While the end result of shaving is basically the same which is not surprising because the Arcitec implements the same &#x27;lift and cut&#x27; technology, it appears to be much gentler to my skin, the more flexible shaving heads better follow my face and neck, has a better grip, comes with a more protective storage/charger pod and, of course, is prettier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Each one offers a little more detail than the rest, but costs noticeably more for that detail.</li>
            <li> ;  the trimmer works very well;  no fuss to clean, just open the three heads over the sink, they hold the shaved wiskers very satisfactorally until dumped (mini-minimal drops to the floor or my chest;  no need to rinse but probably smarter to do in the long run;  very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> Very cool blue LEDs and all that.  </li>
            <li> nothing but positive returns here.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do notice something else rather positive, though: no whisker dust on my clothes.  </li>
            <li> I do notice something else rather positive, though: no whisker dust on my clothes.  </li>
            <li> I bought this not knowing what to really expect as this was my first electric shaving machine.</li>
            <li> The docking station works well and it charges pretty fast and also holds it&#x27;s charge for quite some time.</li>
            <li> The first really \\&quot;out of the box\\&quot; Norelco in years.  </li>
            <li> I had no trouble adjusting to the shave, but the jury is out on the other aspects of what makes a good electric razor.  </li>
            <li> although this \\&quot;early warning system\\&quot; looks cool, it&#x27;s overkill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its quiet, lasts as long as specified and gives a pretty good shave to the face.     </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t told my son I don&#x27;t like it because he&#x27;s young and thinks it&#x27;s cool to just be shaving, and the 1050 does have</li>
            <li> The older two, overall work better.  </li>
            <li> On the positive side, the mechanism they designed for this is very clever.  </li>
            <li> It does take a little while to get the longer hairs, and if you go over your face more then 3-4 times it starts giving razor burn!  </li>
            <li> The three silver shaving discs contrast the black theme nicely.</li>
            <li> The Braun sounds Bold and Busy with its Bounding Buzz.  </li>
            <li> Most days I shave as soon as I stumble out of bed at 4:30AM, without so much as washing my face.  </li>
            <li> One minor issue with it is the trimmer on the back for sideburns is not as good as the Braun one</li>
            <li> The Norelco arcitec 1050, while doing reasonably well at the job of cleaning the scruff off one&#x27;s mug, seems to require more passes to do the same thing the older models managed with one.</li>
            <li> [cheap, cheap!), which unlike previous Norelco models, dies very, very young.  </li>
            <li> This just looks good but shaves are not very good</li>
            <li> My single blade electric shaver works better.</li>
            <li> I have to shave over and over to get certain spots, and I get shaver burn.</li>
            <li> The grouping of the three blades is to large.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is very precise but is very limited in its usefulness.  </li>
            <li> Overall I am extremely pleased with the new Arcitec and recommend it.</li>
            <li> Cleaning of the machine is easy and very efficient, you just open the blade covers and hold them under running water.</li>
            <li> In short, this is a great razor, not a perfect one, but a great one that does the job that I&#x27;ve long sought for a Norelco or any electric razor to do.</li>
            <li> Additionally, after seeing several reviews claiming that this razor was only good for shaving everday, and could not handle 2-3 day growth, I recently shaved after allowing my beard to grow for three full days just to test how the razor would handle it.</li>
            <li> The last thing I own to say is that the shave itself felt less smooth during shaving.  </li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t like the idea of having to clean and rinse it after each use, but really it only takes two seconds to do</li>
            <li> It looks nice and has nice features, but I think its functionality isn&#x27;t worth the high price tag.king razor, but the functionality of the razor itself is pretty bad.</li>
            <li> If you really like them so much how can you pass up a deal like that?</li>
            <li> In theory it should follow the contours of your face really well.  </li>
            <li> The 1090x costs as much as an ipod</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t really a problem</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t expect much difference.      </li>
            <li> Fortunately, this razor got lost on a cross country flight</li>
            <li> The case is VERY bulky to travel with.   </li>
            <li> After much waiting  </li>
            <li> Remington hangs with the Norelco products just at a much lower price.  </li>
            <li> Once upon a time I had a screen type shaver and it cut much closer.</li>
            <li> -Very</li>
            <li> But the point is, if I have to pull out my blade to take care of my neck, why not just shave my whole face with it?</li>
            <li> I have bought a Panasonic shaver which shaves much closrt and has lasted much longer.  </li>
            <li> But I needed it too much to wait for another one to show up.</li>
            <li> so it charges while in the stand which is really convenient.  </li>
            <li> thanks amazon</li>
            <li> And the shave is much closer - so close my wife noticed it before I could tell her.</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very futuristic.</li>
            <li> The discs are gentle.</li>
            <li> Although the Braun is a louder shaver, the trimmer does not introduce much added</li>
            <li> I really could use this razor in place of the Braun, day in and day out.</li>
            <li> Although the Braun is a louder shaver, the trimmer does not introduce much added noise.    </li>
            <li> I really could use this razor in place of the Braun, day in and day out.</li>
            <li> Then the 1050 is absolutely the model you should get as</li>
            <li> the much pricier 1090 is identical in every respect except that the LED array includes a battery charge countdown(which ironically draws power), providing you a ballpark idea of when you&#x27;ll run out of juice.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much of a difference now and if not a differnce at all</li>
            <li> the head design and pivot features really work on stubborn neck hair.  </li>
            <li> If you buy this razor (which I don&#x27;t recommend) you will find it gets better over the 21 days, but in the end it still does not perform as expected.     </li>
            <li> With my old Norelco rotary, I had to really work to make sure my neck got shaved and sometimes had to touch up with a regular blade.  </li>
            <li> As stated by Norelco, it took several weeks for the razor to be really comfortable.  </li>
            <li> if you beard is like that get a straight razor and some foam.</li>
            <li> It was very well made,and looked it.</li>
            <li> : This razor really holds its charge well.</li>
            <li> Remember that if you are really dissatisfied, you can return it to Norelco within 60 days and receive a refund.</li>
            <li> Very efficient shave.</li>
            <li> The trimmer isn&#x27;t much, buy that seperate.</li>
            <li> I really like the look of this shaver</li>
            <li> I have very senitive skin</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this shaver.</li>
            <li> - i think it should really be around 100 dollars.</li>
            <li> Nearly $200 worth of junk.    </li>
            <li> So much for their line of  \\&quot;even on the neck\\&quot;.     </li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t work very  well either</li>
            <li> Thanks Philips for all of your assistance.</li>
            <li> and it worked out very well.</li>
            <li> I wish Philips had spent money on designing rather than advertisements to offer a better</li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> The shaver also feels very flimsy and  not well built, much like a toy or a novel gadget.     </li>
            <li> and it really seems that you are not going to know whether or not the shaver you choose is going to do the job until you buy it and try it.</li>
            <li> Does not offer enough weight and support for that comfortable massage of the face while shaving.</li>
            <li> wanted to like this shaver, I really did.  </li>
            <li> so if anyone wants to get this razor for the $40 off look else where because you wont get it.</li>
            <li> This review comes from much experience with the brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean since you only need open the shave heads and rinse it under running water.</li>
            <li> The included travel case protects the shaver very well.  </li>
            <li> Would never spend so much on a razor</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this product to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> I am not going to use it that much</li>
            <li> needed, a number of indicators/warnings discretely light up on shaver&#x27;s body: low battery, charing indicator, needs cleaning indicator, travel lock and shaving head replacement</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ll ever have the experience of running so low on power that I can&#x27;t comfortably finish shaving.  </li>
            <li> but they were cheap (about 30 busks) and lasted only about 18 months.</li>
            <li> The flex head design works very well.  </li>
            <li> It has a sleek design and is much lighter (the sides are made of carbon fiber).  </li>
            <li> I have an Philips Norelco arcitec 1050 Men&#x27;s Shaver and really like it.</li>
            <li> I guess if that is the case, the reviewer doesn&#x27;t have much to compare this product with.</li>
            <li> very flexible.  </li>
            <li> VERY UNTRUE.  </li>
            <li> Third, this thing doesn&#x27;t cut longer hair; that is, it won&#x27;t shave more than a 1-day old shave.  </li>
            <li> The shave is good, stubble starts to show by late afternoon.  </li>
            <li> than it normally does if I shave everyday, but I was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> like rotary shavers and have used them most of my adult life, but this one is a let-down, especially for the $130+ price.</li>
            <li> With my old one track norelco it takes several more minutes to get close.  </li>
            <li> With my old one track norelco it takes several more minutes to get close.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I got this new one in the first place was because the 9170XL I have broke (plastic piece of the head broke of because of cheap design).    </li>
            <li> This new Arcitec worked very well when I first got it</li>
            <li> First new shaver I had in 10 years.  </li>
            <li> On the first shave, I was getting the shave I wanted; did not have to wait the 2-3 weeks for my face to get used to the new shaver, as warned by the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> Nope, the old Norelco got rid of it right away.</li>
            <li> The clipper will protrude very slightly from the body and you cannot use it easily or effectively because the shaving head are in the way.   </li>
            <li> It is much easier to clean than the others, as each blade opens individually and you can really get in there with the faucet.</li>
            <li> You have to pop open three separate chambers rather than flip the whole head up to clean each blade.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco shavers for many years and prefer them to all other models I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Better than other Norelcos</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it does a reasonable job in a pinch, and for a long time I never really knew what a good, close shave felt</li>
            <li> (one can&#x27;t blow it out without getting hair dust all over the bathroom, and it can&#x27;t be shaken into the wastebasket as easily as the older models), and I spray it quickly with Remington Silicone Lubricant (I can only find it at Wal-Mart, which is the only thing I ever go there for, by the way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:</li>
            <li> (one can&#x27;t blow it out without getting hair dust all over the bathroom, and it can&#x27;t be shaken into the wastebasket as easily as the older models), and I spray it quickly with Remington Silicone Lubricant (I can only find it at Wal-Mart, which is the only thing I ever go there for, by the way).    </li>
            <li> I have never had a shaver get total clean on the neck, but this razor did much better than any other I ever had....</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s perfectly clean for the next use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small inconvenience for such a great shave.  </li>
            <li> I bought this thinking that more expensive is better and in reality, the exact opposite is true.</li>
            <li> I own this shaver and wish I would have taken it back but waited too long.  </li>
            <li> It comes with a travel \\&quot;sarcophagus\\&quot; (which I find a nice detail) which can also be used to charge the razor, and a charging stand; the hair deposit chambers for each blade do fill quickly, particularly with anything older than a day old stubble for me, and a sign comes up asking you to empty them - which is done quickly and easily enough.    </li>
            <li> Most of the times I had to use a conventional razor with gel after I had used the Norelco.</li>
            <li> Shave quality the same as the older design and trimming function has always been just adequate which means you should use a razor afterwards in certain areas.</li>
            <li> Like most modern rechargeable razors, it&#x27;s slightly underpowered compared to it&#x27;s plug in ancestors.</li>
            <li> On the older models you can remove and clean the individual blades.</li>
            <li> Besides the comfortable shave the Arcitec comes with pretty good support (money back promise, 800 support number), looks good and, based on my prior experience with an earlier Philips Norelco shaver, is likely to last for a long, long time.</li>

            <li> The built-in trimmer is small and effective.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it only works for that- looking cool in your sink.</li>
            <li> The Norelco arcitec 1050 is beautiful and flawed.</li>
            <li> I own a trimmer set so the small trimmer isn&#x27;t a problem.  </li>
            <li> I have a better than average beard</li>
            <li> If you charge it up before you go out of town, (it only takes an hour for full charge)</li>
            <li> Full charge time is only 30 minutes.    </li>
            <li> The shave is quick, smooth and close, and the unique head design allows for some serious precision manscaping (if you&#x27;re into that sort of thing!)     </li>
            <li> but then the heads cap, the cleaning brush and the charging cord are &#x27;outside&#x27; and they are easy to lose, especially the first two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but then the heads cap, the cleaning brush and the charging cord are &#x27;outside&#x27; and they are easy to lose, especially the first two.       </li>
            <li> This is just way too much to spend on a shaver that, in my opinion, works little better than a toy.</li>
            <li> So back it goes to get one of the cheaper model (8200 series) instead of their newer design that may look great but fall very short of the other design which now is the 8200 series.</li>
            <li> My present Norelco, about 5 years old, is still going strong but needs a new battery</li>
            <li> So, basically I would say do not buy this razor, you can get a much better one for $ less than this one.</li>
            <li> The trimmer itself works much better than those on previous Norelcos.    </li>
            <li> If I got a lemon ok, but I put three different heads on that Norelco and all had the same results.</li>
            <li> Over the years there has been a steady decline in cycle time of the blade replacement and an increase in price.</li>
            <li> I bought this thing to replace an older floating head style Philips Norelco that I dropped and broke.  </li>
            <li> My older Norelco was close, but not quite.  </li>
            <li> Buy an older Norelco or buy blades - don&#x27;t buy this thing.</li>
            <li> There are 3 main Arcitec models: 1050, 1060, and 1090.  </li>
            <li> and I want to be super quiet.</li>
            <li> and I want to be super quiet.</li>
            <li> They reccomned the traditional style 8260xl that has blades made for more coarse hair.</li>
            <li> (that is if you&#x27;re lucky enough to have hair!).</li>
            <li> , so I use my older shaver for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , so I use my older shaver for that.    </li>
            <li> Oh, darn, I am now being forced to upgrade and I was quite happy with my current shaver.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some of the marketing claims: quick shave, 50% larger (than what???)</li>
            <li> Luckily I have a different razor for those purposes.  </li>
            <li> The main cutter assembly (RQ10, which Amazon sells for $35) attaches to the body and pivots like a joystick.</li>
            <li> Even my old first-gen Norelco Nivea razor with cheap NiCad batteries, could be left in the charger forever</li>
            <li> /&gt;Things I liked about this razor are that it holds a charge for a reasonably long time, it does a decent job, and it lasted me a fairly long time.</li>
            <li> Third thing I noticed was the sound is a much higher pitch and is simply noisy.      </li>
            <li> But along comes this slick new Norelco Arcitec with its sleek looks and amazing seemingly floating shaving heads.</li>
            <li> The pleasant items about using the electric include: I have only gotten two small nicks in two weeks.  </li>
            <li> The material finishes are extremely high end.</li>
            <li> (to prevent shaving too high on the cheek) - the rest of the time I can walk around or watch TV.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Norelco Arcitec.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> So, after a week with this shaver I traded it in for a Braun Series 7 Shaver and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m knocking off a star because I feel the price is a bit high for what it does.  </li>
            <li> a new head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing looks cool, the battery lasts a long time but it does not shave very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recently bought the Wahl Trimmer Shaper for almost $250 less and it does a FAR superior job.</li>
            <li> Well if you have a lot of money to throw around and want to give your teen son who barely has any facial hair a really cool looking gadget to show off to his friends then this might be a good way to throw your money down the drain.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The trimmer is just OK and will take a little getting used to because of</li>
            <li> It does take slightly a few more passes when shaving than my older Nivea Norelco, but it is not a deal breaker.  </li>
            <li> My last Norelco lasted 14 years and gave a pretty decent shave the whole time.  </li>
            <li> The other problem is the battery can not be easily replaced in any of the models.    </li>
            <li> The hard shell travel case is nice.  </li>
            <li> The new design eleminates the need for the pressure adjustment wheel on the older model.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much difference between this unit and the old (9170XL) style when it comes to the quality of the shave.</li>
            <li> Much easier than having the take all the heads out and swish them one at a time as with my old 7825.  </li>
            <li> The nice thing is that after a while, the face of the skin developes a specific soft touch, which does not develop with wet shaving.</li>
            <li> I have just normal thickness of hair and  growth.</li>
            <li> and I more often then not skip a few days on the weekends.</li>
            <li> I tried it two or three more times but it still felt harsh to me.</li>
            <li> During that time I needed to change shaving heads twice (which seems fairly normal to me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So maybe that the poor 1050 performance was a good thing.    </li>
            <li> On a final note, the stand is a bit flimsy and tips easily, and the plug is a bit large, but those are minor considerations.</li>
            <li> I can assure you that after nearly half an hour of ramming and  scrubbing this thing around on your neck, it will have a nice red glow for about 2 or 3 hours that  just screams \\&quot;hey look at my 15 minute halfass</li>
            <li> It was decent but left too many hairs, not smooth and was hot to the touch.</li>
            <li> Since I have Irish, red, naturally curly hair on both head and face the close AND comfortable shave is appreciated.</li>
            <li> You definitely need to make sure that your face is very dry when using it, or else you&#x27;ll find yourself pressing it against your skin to try to pick up a stray hair</li>
            <li> I am still using the original (initial) charge, and although I don&#x27;t use this razor to shave everyday, I originally charged it Christmas Eve.</li>
            <li> I purchased a new blade and washed the razor every day.</li>
            <li> I was so horrified by their \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; model,</li>
            <li> If you leave the razor in it&#x27;s charging bay when its fully charged you will deplete the battery live.</li>
            <li> I have owned this razor for about 18 months and it doesn&#x27;t live up to it&#x27;s promise.  </li>
            <li> This new thing must have been designed by a woman.  </li>
            <li> So I bought a new set of blades.</li>
            <li> I can live with that.    </li>
            <li> Rotten product, can&#x27;t believe I fell for the hype, and can&#x27;t believe I have to buy a new shaver.</li>
            <li> Not one for close shaves, I needed a new shaver and fell into the Consumer Report thing of buying the highest rated shaver:  Braun 8985.  </li>
            <li> Finally a new design I have been shaving with norelco for 25 years</li>
            <li> When that razor needed new blades I decided to splurge and get this one, since a set of heads would cost as much as a new razor.    </li>
            <li> Even with brand new blades this razor misses about 1 in 10 hairs on my neck.</li>
            <li> and they suggested I purchase NEW heads.</li>
            <li> Do you need new heads every 30 days?</li>
            <li> My advice to those in need of a new shaver:</li>
            <li> update: Still using it, with new blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not trusting the new Norelco &#x27;3D&#x27; razor.</li>
            <li> In the interest of trying something new, I have tried electrics before.  </li>
            <li> One user even said it costs almost as much as a new razor.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s $33 and change on Amazon for a new razor head.  </li>
            <li> So I bought a new 790CC Braun Shaver.</li>
            <li> I guess that works for them since they hope you will then buy a new shaver.  </li>
            <li> It shaves faster, better and it gets into the hard to get places much easer.</li>
            <li> Clean, relatively quick saves; gets the long wiskers too; smooth face;  no razor burn; long lasting (long!)</li>
            <li> Actually, the sound is a low drone...</li>
            <li> The shave overall is ok, but not very close.</li>
            <li> However, it means the razor sits open drying most of the time which is no real problem, but annoys me.  </li>
            <li> After trying the Braun Pulsonic and finding it a bit rough on my face the Arcitec worked much better (your face may react differently</li>
            <li> Lift-and-cut is a ridiculous concept and a marketing ploy, but Norelco&#x27;s do a nice job.  </li>
            <li> It takes the same time to get a smooth shave, and the same persistance in some areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pivoting head technology is clearly inferior to Norelcos older units.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most likely, Norelco is just being careful.  </li>
            <li> You have to wash it very frequently because the reservoir for stubble is non existent.  </li>
            <li> As a consequence, the shaving required more mechanical pressure and an increased number of strokes, resulting apparently also in increased micro skin injuries, followed by typical skin burn or even rash over time.</li>
            <li> However the trimmer blade--for sideburns, etc., is not easy to use or as effective as the traditional Norelce triple-header shaver.</li>
            <li> The new razor arrived in a sealed new package,like they have at the store,and they also sent a postage paid label,and instructions to send the old razor and all accessories and a copy of the invoice in the box the new one came in,and I could then just put it in any UPS drop box to mail it.  </li>
            <li> And, worse, must clean after each use, and it is 3X harder to clean because you have to individually open three compartments, using two fingers, after every use or two, compared to the old style where you can just flip it open, easily, with your thumb and clean it every week or two.  </li>
            <li> First, the trimmer is short and cuts your hair when you try to trim your sideburns.  </li>
            <li> While it didn&#x27;t cut me it left my skin feeling hot and worn out.  </li>
            <li> I researched the field pretty well and read various reviews.  </li>
            <li> Cleanup is a snap - pop open the three chambers and rinse with hot water.  </li>
            <li> The days I shower first, 12 hours later it is like I just shaved.</li>
            <li> When I first saw the commercial for the arcitect, I was intrigued.</li>
            <li> Prior to buying, I read many many of the reviews and as a result was quite skeptical and leary about trying one.  </li>
            <li> and I am experiencing exactly the same problem</li>
            <li> This is the first time i&#x27;m actually using an electric razor</li>
            <li> I have used in the past, although this may be because it&#x27;s a higher-priced, better razor.    </li>
            <li> Simply open the heads and rinse with hot water.  </li>
            <li> First of all it wouldn&#x27;t cut anything beyond one days stubble, Second</li>
            <li> Hang onto your old Norelcos for trimming!    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty obvious you are supposed to.  </li>
            <li> One last observation, and I&#x27;m not the first one to make it...  </li>
            <li> So I made a return for the arcitec and what a major change!!!</li>
            <li> The included travel carrier is useful, though a little tricky to figure out how to use at first.</li>
            <li> After about 6 shaves now, I get a shave as good as a razor and cream, and with less time and mess.  </li>
            <li> It is now clear to me that making cheaper products and offering no service is Norelco&#x27;s new business model.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the 1050 to replace my old Phillips Quadra 6865 which needed new heads and rechargeable batteries.</li>
            <li> The complete head is changed for a new, one piece, bladed head; takes seconds to change.    </li>
            <li> When my old Remington shaver&#x27;s battery started to die I decided to change for a new razor.</li>
            <li> So, I travel with my old NORELCO and use the new Arcitec 1050 at home.</li>
            <li> I replaced the cutter head at 12 months, but found out my old head still cut at about 90% - 95% of the new one, so the cutters are durable.  </li>
            <li> and it still doesn&#x27;t shave as closely as my old Norelco or my new Gillette Mach 5.  </li>
            <li> A quality consumer article made in a country where people get real wages paid and have social security and health care.</li>
            <li> I think one reason for the harsh shave is that it doesn&#x27;t have the floating heads anymore that easily give to the contours of your face, this seems to plow into curves instead</li>
            <li> I actually think I can shave with a normal bic razor &amp; shaving cream just as fast as I can with the arcitec, though</li>
            <li> The 1050 has only 1 indicator for battery recharge needed, the 1060 has several LED indicators showing how much charge is left, and the 1090 has an LED double-digit display showing how many minutes of shaving are left.  </li>
            <li> Adorned in several shades of black, dark gray, and silver, with catchy real carbon fiber side panels and a matte rubber finish along the backside for good grip.</li>
            <li> In addition, it shaves quickly and closely with minimal irritation.</li>
            <li> I will do a 4 stars at this time for a good quality, well designed electric shaver that appears to be an incremental improvement over previous generations but whose capabilities may be a little over-hyped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will do a 4 stars at this time for a good quality, well designed electric shaver that appears to be an incremental improvement over previous generations but whose capabilities may be a little over-hyped.    </li>
            <li> After reading some of the positive reviews; I don&#x27;t understand why their experiences can be so radically different than mine.</li>
            <li> so while I had braved the cuts and waste of money and time of creams and razors-and yes they are closer shaves for a lot more money-and blades that cost about same as gasoline, I have always felt that if I shower first to soften my tough beard, then let my beard dry a bit, the Norelco was almost as good as a blade.</li>
            <li> Even after a lot of razor burn I still had quiet long hairs left on my neck and on my chin after many passes.     </li>
            <li> The design is far out, way too far out!</li>
            <li> I am baffled by these poor reviews, I used a norelco before with the three heads, but this one is markedly BETTER!</li>
            <li> The Braun is better overall, but by a slight margin.</li>
            <li> The Braun is better overall, but by a slight margin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a very nice looking razor, but the functionality of the razor itself is pretty bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent 5 minutes many times, fishing a  single head hair out of one of the cutters.    </li>
            <li> was that the blades had a really tough time snagging hairs when it&#x27;s warm or humid.</li>
            <li> Now maybe I&#x27;m just one unlucky guy, getting two shavers that have exactly the same problems and almost within the same time frame (1 year), but this seems to indicate a design flaw in this particular model.</li>
            <li> And what is with the trimmer, you cannot trim anything or cut your hair with this trimmer-you cannot even see what you are doing should you want to do a quick side burn or sides of your hair trim as with other Norelcos.  </li>
            <li> Well, I had high hopes for this razor but after using it for a few months ago, I must say it is a piece of cool looking</li>
            <li> I also find this razor to be a lot easier to clean than previous Norelco razors.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to believe the negative reviews because they&#x27;re not just criticisms of obscure details of this razor; rather, they&#x27;re criticisms of the ability of this razor to do its main job.    </li>
            <li> looks&#x27; is clearly Arcitec&#x27;s distinguishing feature.</li>
            <li> The looks&#x27; is clearly Arcitec&#x27;s distinguishing feature.</li>
            <li> I am offering to sell my 3 months old</li>
            <li> I replaced a few batteries and quite a few cutters, but overall it was great.    </li>
            <li> First, it took twice as long  to shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone back to my straight edge.</li>
            <li> Second, the blades are not replaceable, so you have to replace the whole head assembly.  </li>
            <li> I regret getting rid of my old Norelco before trying this one.  </li>
            <li> For this old guy it even works on eyebrows and nosehair</li>
            <li> not so compared to my old Braun 7550 which I was buying blades for every couple of months..</li>
            <li> I would prefer to have a stand and a way to connect the cord directly to the razor.    </li>
            <li> This unit is louder than the old (9170XL) style units.</li>
            <li> I bought this product as a gift for my 24 year old son.  </li>
            <li> I replaced a Norelco speed razor that was getting old.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco razors off and on for nearly 40 years.  </li>
            <li> I bought this  Arcitec shaver when my old shaver&#x27;s batteries died.</li>
            <li> I use the clippers on my old Norelco to trim sideburns, mustache, and ears.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to return to my old Norelco for a truly close shave.</li>
            <li> This design, however, is poorly developed.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, you can&#x27;t improve on the old reliable.</li>
            <li> Plug the shaver back in for 5 minutes, and you&#x27;re ready to go for your shave.  </li>
            <li> The battery has lasted through about six shaves so far and doesn&#x27;t seem to be losing power.  </li>
            <li> I had to return the product as after about two weeks my skin started to get very irritated, especially if I tried to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> The early model is near 45 degrees.  </li>
            <li> As a final note, I think the reason this razor does not work very well may have a lot to do with the mounting of the heads.</li>
            <li> and I have been pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I have coarse, wiry whiskers, and plenty of them... and they grow fast.</li>
            <li> I wound up getting replacement parts for his old Braun razor.  </li>
            <li> I find myself using the old shaver instead of this model.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Philips shavers for 20 years and now this machine show me that I should change my old Philips before.</li>
            <li> If you have never used an electric, try this one, and you will be surprised.</li>
            <li> While it does give a closer shave than my old Norelco, the battery must</li>
            <li> The floating moving heads are too soft to allow pressure to be placed under the neck where it&#x27;s needed</li>
            <li> I tried, for a whole year, but I gave up threw the shaver in the trash and went back to a blade.</li>
            <li> I had an old Philips rotary shaver for years until I dropped and broke it.</li>
            <li> and I had been so please with the old one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the fact that you can&#x27;t plug a cord directly into the razor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used nothing but Norelco razors since I was 15 years old.</li>
            <li> And I do not even have sensitive skin.    </li>
            <li> Sounds like the old lithium ion safety problem strikes again.</li>
            <li> I wash my old heads maybe once a week.</li>
            <li> i find the Artic for repleacment my old shaver</li>
            <li> You would have to set it directly on a hair to cut it.  </li>
            <li> Buy it for looks and keep your old one in the drawer for sideburns.  </li>
            <li> Well, I did like the head that swivels to the contour of the face, but that&#x27;s about as far as it went.</li>
            <li> My old Norelco&#x27;s have never exhibited this sensation, so I was somewhat surprised.</li>
            <li> However, I did order a replacement set of blades for my old Norelco from Amazon.</li>
            <li> The 1050x is about 2-3 time noisier than my 15 year old Norelco, WTH?</li>
            <li> a few minutes after my shave test had ended, my 1050x side was now irritated and not feeling comfortable [like my 5885xl side was].</li>
            <li> The Arcitec is replacing my almost 3 year old [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is no way to replace the battery inside the shaver but, based on my experience with Architec&#x27;s precursor, my 2.5 year old 8140XL, this should not be an issue.</li>
            <li> I used to use an early foil remmington years ago.</li>
            <li> It is so much easier for him to use this on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I needed to replace my old razor.</li>
            <li> but I really wanted to try it out and only had stubble on my face at the time.</li>
            <li> what continuing with \\&quot;old faithful\\&quot; would have cost when considering the price of the shaver and scheduled replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> I bought this razor because I thought it would be an improvement over my old Norelco.</li>
            <li> it is worth every penny spent.  </li>
            <li> this is a much better shaver than there earlier model i bought a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> Losing the occasional red spots on my neck was very much worth it.</li>
            <li> Losing the occasional red spots on my neck was very much worth it.</li>
            <li> About 2 years ago, the battery in my beloved Braun started to fail.</li>
            <li> For decades, I wet shaved with the most expensive (and best) Gillette blades, because every episode with a Braun shaver resulted within a short period in serious skin irritation.</li>
            <li> I purchased a third blade and for 3 weeks I got a decent shave but still with the above issues requiring the use of a straight razor.</li>
            <li> You just run hot water over the circular blades and air dry.    </li>
            <li> I got into the habit of shaving using water alone first, followed by dry, followed by an aloe lotion.  </li>
            <li> I like to use oil before I shave and the 8240 allows me to remove the heads, dump them in a container with some rubbing alcohol, and easily clean them with a few shakes.</li>
            <li> I typically will use an electric razor to trim it to short, use this razor to get most of what&#x27;s left and then use a foil head to get it to be even/</li>
            <li> I still have several older Norelco models for comparison, one in my travel case, and one in my RV.  </li>
            <li> It replaced my older Norelco, which was the 2nd Norelco I owned, so this makes #3.  </li>
            <li> It took about a week for the shaver to break-in enough that it got everything on a first or second pass</li>
            <li> Expect a pimply rash at times as well, of which was never typical of my skin.  </li>
            <li> Overall a decent product.</li>
            <li> Usually they do not last more than an year.</li>
            <li> The reality is that the 3 heads together add up to a decent shaving surface, and the Arcitec&#x27;s are not larger than the 8140XL&#x27;s</li>
            <li> The shaving experience is much different; a clever design change, which I like.    </li>
            <li> A recent try with a high end</li>
            <li> I have gone back and forth between the razor and my old triple-head Norelco and decided it was time to get a new one.</li>
            <li> After trying out a Philips (Norelco) 7120 to see if I could escape the wet razor trap I was ready for the next step; that model worked fine, except that by design the battery doesn&#x27;t last that long</li>
            <li> It is about half  an inch wide and while it does work better than the rest of the razor it sounds like a wood</li>
            <li> This product is for people with beards that are not thick or coarse.</li>
            <li> First off the heads do not float and the triple head which I expected to give and get into places where i normally have to go over again actually is firmer and makes me have to repeat 3, 4 argg 5 times.</li>
            <li> I have been mostly a blade man for about 25 years, having only made a few brief attempts at using an electric.  </li>
            <li> and I thought my beard was not very tough, especially with the razors and cream.</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s a more expensive, flashier looking gadget that succeeds in looks/packaging and fails in its main mission: to shave.  </li>
            <li> it is good if you wanted not a perfect shave but a quick shave, recommended for wet and Dry mode........</li>
            <li> I think as a fair courtesy Phillips Norelco should offer all arcitec owners a 50 percent off if they trade in their old arcitec for the new one as I feel totally ripped off, almost angry enough to switch to Braun</li>
            <li> The Arcitec wins hands down.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just my facial hair \\&quot;type\\&quot;, or maybe using the Lectric Shave helps that much more than the users that put no pre-shave on, but all I can tell you is that I get the results I&#x27;ve desired for a long time--a close shave with NO remaining neck and chin stubble--with NO irritation and spending less time doing it.       </li>
            <li> As I noted above, all indicators and warnings light up when only when needed and are invisible at any other time.</li>
            <li> As I noted above, all indicators and warnings light up when only when needed and are invisible at any other time.</li>
            <li> So anyhow I just bought the new 1050 at wally world and it is quite different.</li>
            <li> Then we got prompted to buy the Philips Norelco arcitec 1050 Men&#x27;s Shaver after we got influenced by the massive ad campaign of the new arcitec series from Philips.</li>
            <li> They can offer NO remedies to my concerns, and only indicate the &#x27;company line&#x27; that the new RQ12+ is &amp;#34;better&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> but I cannot say that it is any better or worse than the trimmer on my old Norelcos, though it is narrower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to the regular size beard and sideburn trimmers that are common on most Norelco razors; this one is about 1/3 the size.  </li>
            <li> The Phillips machine uses rotating blades, at comparably low speed, and for whatever reason, the blade rotation technology (which is in existence for at least 50 years or so) cuts my hair much more efficiently than a horizontally vibrating blade bar.</li>
            <li> It worked very well with short hairs and left me with no irritated skin on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I REALLY wanted this shave to be the one because it was the most expensive shaver I bought..</li>
            <li> I replaced a different manufacturer&#x27;s very old electric razor with the Arcitec 1050, and have been using it for about three weeks.  </li>
            <li> This only noteworthy things about this old unit is that I have had to have the batteries replaced only two times, but this is normal since they wear out every 6 years or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He says it gives the closest shave than any other shaver he has owned ( we have been married 33 years</li>
            <li> One of my pet peeves with current and past Norelcos is placement of the power button, which I would accidentally turn it off with my right thumb (onc certain models).  </li>
            <li> Further, Norelco should really be ashamed to be making such astonishingmarketing claims for a product that is so clearly defective in design and such a step backward in product evolution (devolution).      </li>
            <li> I tried Norelco&#x27;s first generation of the Nivea wet shaver and it was great, though it did run out of Nivea fast, which was hard to find and expensive</li>
            <li> I quickly wore out the the cleaning  brush they supplied and started using a stiff bristle toothbrush instead.</li>
            <li> However, if I was using a new blade, I would frequently have several deep cuts and nicks.  </li>
            <li> This new head style has really been a downgrade because when you apply pressure, the heads seem to pull away from your face on the outside part of it and it makes it harder to shave.</li>
            <li> I worry about long term repair costs and reliability vs. the older style.</li>
            <li> Shaving with this model takes twice as long as my older model.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other Philips shavers you can not plug this shaver into your outlet, you have to place it in the carrying pod or shavers stand, this is a inconvenience to me, I am pretty sure its a matter of time before I drop this carrying pod and break it, or worse spill water on it by mistake and damage it ( the charger is not water proof).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A grown man with a tough beard will find that this functions better as a paperweight than as a razor.  </li>
            <li> This is a minor issue and I would recommend this product highly anyways.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I only feel this way because I have been used to a regular Gilette razor and my expectations were too high.</li>
            <li> I think it may come down a little more astime goes by.  </li>
            <li> The only draw back about this shaver is it can be a little tedious to clean because each head opens separately but other than that this shaver is a great product.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is not very user friendly compared to other Norelco shaver trimmers.  </li>
            <li> Also on the downside, the side-burn trimmer is completely inadequate; it too tiny to be functional.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back to my old Norelco now.</li>
            <li> If the engineers would actually use this razor they would notice that removing the abaility for you to connect the razor directly to the charging cable is a problem.</li>
            <li> The head design is very similar to the old (9170XL) one</li>
            <li> There is a low battery indicator and it seems to last a few days even after that light comes on.  </li>
            <li> I went back to my old Norelco and will be hesitant to buy another.  </li>
            <li> You have to go over areas many times and sometimes, if the facial hair is too long (say, past a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow) the razor won&#x27;t cut it at all.</li>
            <li> I ended up switching to a regular old Mach 3</li>
            <li> It gives a barely acceptable shave if you shave every day.</li>
            <li> It was going back 10 years as far as shaving is concerned.  </li>
            <li> It doesnt give a close shaver, even though I spent twice as much time shaving.</li>
            <li> Even with the head removed, it barely trims my mustache.  </li>
            <li> After a year of all of the above I have just completely had it with the piece junk.</li>
            <li> Overall: Buy it for looks and keep your old one in the drawer for sideburns.  </li>
            <li> and if you are not careful you will encounter razor burn.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product to anyone and especially people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was devastated that my wife gave me this requested gift and could not get it at Costco (now I know reason) and found that I had to go back to my 8270 xl in order to complete my shave under my nose, on my cheeks and on parts of my neck.     </li>
            <li> This razor does especially well on 2 or 3 day old beards.</li>
            <li> These blades were costing me more that one dollar a day to shave and giving a poor shave at the three week mark.</li>
            <li> , it did slightly better on the neck but did a worse job on the face.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes you need to go several times over the same neck spot because &#x27;lift and cut&#x27; is good but not perfect</li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars if not for the poor trimmer, like most reviewers mention.  </li>
            <li> shaver comes to you inside a triple-layered protective/defensive enclosure, hard plastic over cardboard over another clamshell (but easy to open) protective plastic layer.</li>
            <li> I actually had my wife feel both shaves afterwords to confirm I wasn&#x27;t being overly critical of my new toy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not thrilled that the razor has to be washed daily, but it is easy to do.  </li>
            <li> I leave the heads open to dry and then close them when I am ready to use it again.</li>
            <li> The springs under each shave head are quite stiff, and the design means that the heads rarely sit flush against the face.</li>
            <li> The plus side of it is that it costs about $100 less and looks pretty swanky.    </li>
            <li> As stated by several (or most) reviewers, the trimmer is the really weak point.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s hard to clean, too.</li>
            <li> Now with the other Norelcos I&#x27;ve had that was never too much of a problem.  </li>
            <li> Hard to clean.</li>
            <li> Cleaning is much easier with this one than any other I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> There really isn&#x27;t much else to say about the trimmer other than I thought it worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The result is not very good, even on a good day I have a shadow, my face feels rough and after shaving it is a little sore.      </li>
            <li> The 1050, 1060, and 1090 all operate the same, they just have a different display: none is better than the other, and don&#x27;t waste money on the Cleaner accessory.  </li>
            <li> The Norelco replacement heads are about 30% more expensive than Braun&#x27;s Series 5, and 8000 series, although the new \\&quot;cassette\\&quot; system with the Pulsonic is about the same.  </li>

            <li> I am NOT a dry shave guy.  </li>
            <li> You can get as good of shave with a 9170XL SpeedXL which has the same cutting head technology and gain the comfort and save $120.</li>
            <li> It takes constant use for a few weeks to get one&#x27;s skin used to an electric razor, including this one, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> I have a \\&quot;tough\\&quot; beard and it has also performed well after a two day beard growth; takes a little longer but a pretty close shave.  </li>
            <li> The representative was very polite and helpful,and I explained the problem,and admitted to having lost the receipt,and he STILL said that they&#x27;re replace it right away,if I would agree to send the broken one to them promptly,postage prepaid by THEM.</li>
            <li> Just cant imagine the stupidity of the designers and can&#x27;t understand the simple reason as to why they would change a good size trimmer from previous versions to an obscure one which does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> Shave is not very close, no better than my 1999 Panasonic which is still using its original head; trimmer is less than useful; on the plus side, it is very quiet.</li>
            <li> It takes a long time to get a complete shave.  </li>
            <li> Second, it barely traps clippings.  </li>
            <li> I own a 9160xl and was disappointed on its performance so after explaining that to a norelco service rep the only info they had provided was how I can get a closer shave, which i was aware of.</li>
            <li> The first few days to week with the electric</li>
            <li> In the first few minutes, the shaver gets the bulk of the whiskers; the remaining time is trying to get a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> Got this one and the first thing I noticed was that the power cord would not directly fit into the shaver.  </li>
            <li> The instructions call for rinsing in hot water; a waste of energy.  </li>
            <li> The new Norelco is lighter than the others which seems to require pressing harder with it to get a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> It also achieves a very close shave in less time than the Norelco.  </li>
            <li> It also achieves a very close shave in less time than the Norelco.  </li>
            <li> It gave me a much smoother and closer shave with less chafing and discomfort.</li>
            <li> However, the Arcitec stands out by having a very distinctive slender look, the triple head surface on a flat conical piece that is affixed to a pivot, unlike the \\&quot;neckless\\&quot; other models.  </li>
            <li> It looks very high-tech with its articulated heads, but the bottom line is it shaves no better than my old model.</li>
            <li> Although electronics tend to die early, or last a long time.      </li>
            <li> I graduated to a 5885XL a long time ago and was surprised of the whisper quiet shave it delivered.  </li>
            <li> I need peace and quiet at those early hours, and this would not work long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pivoting heads conform to the lines of my face quite well, however the razor leaves many long hairs behind.  </li>
            <li> The thing about my old razor is that it had floating heads and it handled long hairs pretty well if I was lazy and didn&#x27;t shave.</li>
            <li> My husband is older and every other electric shaver he  ever used always left his skin red and irrateded.   </li>
            <li> When I first used it, the razor was horrible and gave me a huge rash without really shaving very close.</li>
            <li> I am not about to spent [...] on a new head that may only last another 6 months.</li>
            <li> It does not conform that well to my head, but the first time I used it I could feel and hear it cutting better than any of the other Norelco&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I also appreciated the little suction cups at the bottom of the charging stand that add to its stability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also appreciated the little suction cups at the bottom of the charging stand that add to its stability.    </li>
            <li> The only reason I can&#x27;t give this 5 stars, is because of how noisy it is... just a little too much for the morning.  </li>
            <li> However, they are close to what I would get when using a new blade and had to be very careful to prevent gouging my face.      </li>
            <li> This one looks good but performs bad.  </li>
            <li> I read all the bad reviews, then read the good ones and bought it.  </li>
            <li> I read several reviews after it was orded some good and some bad</li>
            <li> Also, it shaved pretty closely when the head was new, although it is still tough to shave the neck and jawline - despite the ads.</li>
            <li> I have a THICK scruff each morning and the Arcitec ate right through it.</li>
            <li> Some things were better and other things worse.    </li>
            <li> The trimmer really needs work and practice and that&#x27;s my only major complaint.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is quite small, but it does work well enough to clean the sideburns with an up and down motion.  </li>
            <li> In short, this is really a sub par shaver, and the price for this poor performance is high.  </li>
            <li> So, while some might praise it, I really do think that they do so because they are judging it in comparison with some much older (and much worse) electric shavers (shaving with which is probably like shaving with an axe).     </li>
            <li> And like I said, I&#x27;ve never  owned any other brand of razor, but I feel completely lied to, cheated, and ripped off by this razor  and Norelco.</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend this product even though it is a little pricey</li>
            <li> Only negatives about the Arcetec style, they are noisier and you have to clean the heads at least every other shave because there is no where for shavings to accumulate.</li>
            <li> but so far I have noticed very little action.</li>
            <li> I used an older model Norelco for many years and never had a problem getting a close shave, so I was very disappointed in this \\&quot;higher end\\&quot; model.</li>
            <li> I now am very careful when I use it and this results in it taking longer to shave than my old razor.</li>
            <li> With the new Arcitec 1050X that time is about cut in half and the shave is on par with a blade.  </li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve seen mixed opinions about how long they last.  </li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve seen mixed opinions about how long they last.  </li>
            <li> Years ago, it would take about a week for the blade to dull enough but, once dull enough, I could use that blade for a month or more before having to switch blades.  </li>
            <li> I previously used a Braun Activator, which was self-cleaning but required special cleaning cartridges that cost anywhere from $8 - $12 for a 2-pack; over 4 years of use and regular cleaning, that brought the total cost of ownership of the unit to at least twice what I initially paid for it.    </li>
            <li> Other&#x27;s have complained that you can&#x27;t replace the blades, just the entire head from the neck up and that appears to be true.  </li>
            <li> This is the \\&quot;worst\\&quot; negative for me, but I&#x27;ll live with it, and just use one of my old razors for the trimmer if I have to.    </li>
            <li> The cutters have a lip around them that makes it awkward to be sure where you&#x27;re shaving but overall performance is terrific.  </li>
            <li> I have to admit, though, it looks slick, like modern art.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read the negative reviews on this razor, and I was prepared to be \\&quot;let down\\&quot; after getting the razor as a Christmas gift, but let me say that for the first time in a while, Philips-Norelco has come through and hit this one out of the park.  </li>
            <li> Shaver works very well, but the trimmer is too small for what I use it for.</li>
            <li> Much too small.  </li>
            <li> I have tried trimming with short hair and long hair neither work well.</li>
            <li> The only redeaming factors are the pivioting head and the long battery life.    </li>
            <li> and I think this actually contributes to the long battery life -which</li>
            <li> Only two minor complaints: 1)</li>
            <li> does it sits flat on it).</li>
            <li> , I just tried a panasonic linear type wet/dry razor which was very loud and took forever to shave, and then not cleanly, I returned it, and now can&#x27;t believe this norelco can be beat.</li>
            <li> It takes the same time to shave as my older unit, and I get no better results, no faster.  </li>
            <li> I want as much cutting surface on my face as possible so the open channel design that &#x27;catches the long hairs&#x27; is for guys who want to let it grow a day or two or more.</li>
            <li> just bought new blades a few times over the years.</li>
            <li> They both are correct, though, when they say that it takes a few weeks for your beard to adjust to the new shaver so you need to give it time before reaching a verdict.</li>
            <li> but for the price, I&#x27;d stick with my old Norelco with the half micro-screen style.  </li>
            <li> it did cut the soft skin and produced skin burns, which I never had with any previous model.</li>
            <li> The manual also states not only should the razor not be left in the charger but it should be charged when the razor is nearly empty or you shorten the battery life.    </li>
            <li> The only time it has \\&quot;grabbed\\&quot; or \\&quot;pulled\\&quot; is with the two day growth; but only minimally.     </li>
            <li> Looking at the mechanics you can quickly tell just how unsophisticated the technology behind the shaver is.</li>
            <li> trimmer is a little small, but adequate.  </li>
            <li> My 22-year-old son has a heavy beard and very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have to go over a single patch of hair ten times to even see skin.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the old, traditional coiled 2-wire cord system like my previous shavers had!  </li>
            <li> Starting with a 2-day shadow growth, I shaved half of my face with my trusty 5885XL [using 1.5 year old blades] and the other half with my shiny new 1050x unit.</li>
            <li> It gives you a very uncomfortable shave, misses areas all together, and doesn&#x27;t work nearly as good as their previous razors.  </li>
            <li> This is my third and most expensive Norelco, and it doesn&#x27;t come close to either of the previous models I have owned in terms of performance.   </li>
            <li> Other models use multiple cells or larger capacity cells.  </li>
            <li> It was tough to decide whether or not to give this product one or two stars, but I gave it two because it doesn&#x27;t completely suck, it&#x27;s just not as good as other razors that aren&#x27;t as expensive</li>
            <li> only negative comment i have is the absurdly high price</li>
            <li> The result, with razor shaves, was bad razor burn and acute discomfort.</li>
            <li> Norelco user and this as the most disappointing razor I purchased.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t count shaving minutes but, at least with a brand-new battery you won&#x27;t need to recharge it very often.</li>
            <li> Overall, not worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> It took a long time to shave and I had to go over the area multiple times in multiple directions and with different pressures just to get a few long hairs.</li>
            <li> The trimmer would not cut nose or ear hair and it left the side burns so long that the regular razor cutting head could not trim them smooth.</li>
            <li> My 3yr old norelco i still have to pull out to get a few missed hairs.</li>
            <li> I am a long time Norelco user.  </li>
            <li> The upshot is that it takes me just as long,</li>
            <li> But Don&#x27;t leave it plugged in for too long.</li>
            <li> I am a long time</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sadly this all changed when I decided to fork out the money on a name I trusted for so long....</li>
            <li> Holds its charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> It charges fully in an hour, and the charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> As long as you use it every day (and won&#x27;t your beard grow too long)</li>
            <li> I am back to my trusty disposable minus $100 plus.</li>
            <li> There is one minor flaw...</li>
            <li> It is much harder to trim my sideburns with this unit as the heads almost cut my hair on my head above the ears the way it is shaped.  </li>
            <li> It is much harder to trim my sideburns with this unit as the heads almost cut my hair on my head above the ears the way it is shaped.  </li>
            <li> For me, it was a rough shave, and it felt similar to a band aid being pulled off of hariy flesh.</li>
            <li> (it takes a long time to shave and it doesn&#x27;t work well on longer hairs).</li>
            <li> (it takes a long time to shave and it doesn&#x27;t work well on longer hairs).</li>
            <li> Shaves with the RQ12+ are not nearly as close.</li>
            <li> I realize that some folks may have really thick beards and facial hair that makes it difficult for ANY electric shaver to give a very close, comfortable shave with minimal or no irritation.  </li>
            <li> However, if you forget to shave for a day or two, you end up having to use a razor first, as thick beard hair has a harder time in this razor.</li>
            <li> And the final result is a shave that&#x27;s barely what you&#x27;d call \\&quot;close\\&quot; and a few loose long hairs that the razor couldn&#x27;t handle.</li>
            <li> Save your money and buy a Norelco that is less expensive and gives you a better shave.</li>
            <li> Now the minuses:  The head lasts less than a year with regular use and the replacement head costs about the same as a year&#x27;s-worth of brand-name razor replacements.  </li>
            <li> I mean, really, it just doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> The reason does not appear to be the small clippings chamber; the reason appears to be the design of the new heads.  </li>
            <li> Since I new I could return it if not satisfied</li>
            <li> I have tried pulling my skin tight and going over the same area 20-times in each direction (40 passes total!)</li>
            <li> If you fail to do this it cuts even worse (if such a thing  is possible) because this razor effectively does not have a place to store what hair it does manage  to cut.</li>
            <li> Plus, it leaves a mess all over your clothes as the heads can barely collect all the trimmed hairs.  </li>
            <li> I suspect it was only added so that when one makes a comparison to other razors, the trimmer doesn&#x27;t exclude the Arcitec.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much smaller and lighter that other electric shavers on the market.</li>
            <li> and I would suggest that you consider other brands as well or be well aware that 2 years doesn&#x27;t mean 2 years to Norelco.</li>
            <li> He would definitely recommend it to other men.</li>
            <li> In all other ways each razor is the same.  </li>
            <li> always dry shave</li>
            <li> when shaving dry?  </li>
            <li> noisy    cons: expensive, but most importantly not a close shaver.</li>
            <li> By the end of the third week on the third blade I was having trouble again getting a close shave.</li>
            <li> The second drawback is that it gives massive razor burns and after few days I could not even use it on my neck at all.</li>
            <li> Folks, do yourself a favor and get an older model, preferably something from the late 90&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Folks, do yourself a favor and get an older model, preferably something from the late 90&#x27;s IMHO.    </li>
            <li> few years back, we bought a second home.</li>
            <li> The then 10 year old razor I got as a hand-me-down when I was 15 shaved  100 times better than this piece of crap ever did.     </li>
            <li> You just take the cutter and comb apart and take the stray hair out, but remember this was  designed as a single piece</li>
            <li> addition, there is a 2-year limited warranty and warrants against defects and, of course, you lose coverage if you abuse your shaver</li>
            <li> In addition, there is a 2-year limited warranty and warrants against defects and, of course, you lose coverage if you abuse your shaver</li>
            <li> I actually shaved half my face with the Arcitec and the other half with my old one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Function:  It is a little bit easier to shave under the nose, above my mustache, but not a major difference.  </li>
            <li> I would rate my facial hair thickness as average</li>
            <li> Cons:      Expensive, by comparison with other models currently available.    </li>
            <li> This is a complete waste of money!</li>
            <li> Unless you just want the apperance, it is not worth the extra money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Technically:  The triple-blade per round head (each cutter has three spinning blade areas) does not do any better than a double cutting blade.  </li>
            <li> Having used Norelcos all of my shaving life, about 25 years, this irritation I feel is not normal, and I do not find this acceptable; even if there is a break-in period; not for me there isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> /&gt;F.25 years, this irritation I feel is not normal, and I do not find this acceptable; even if there is a break-in period; not for me there isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s wrong with these other guys, but I got a 1050X for Christmas, and I have NEVER had a shave with an electric shaver as close and smooth as this one - and</li>
            <li> As for the money back guarantee, well you have to buy a razor, get face burn for 21 days before you can be sure you hate it, then you&#x27;ll probably have to divulge a lot of personal info to Philips and pay shipping etc.</li>
            <li> I mean, it&#x27;s got the high tech looks, the head that swivels to the contour of the face.</li>
            <li> Also - you basically have to clean it every day which is an awkward process because you have to individually lift each razor head and wash it out.  </li>
            <li> Of course everyone has a different face/beard and I would perhaps have put it down to that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  tried going back and forth, up and down, around in circles, clockwise, counter clockwise,  everything imaginable and no matter how you do it, this piece of junk just does not shave.     </li>
            <li> The Arcitec won&#x27;t shave long thin neck hair either, so I have to use the straight razor there as well.</li>
            <li> It can only be used in odd angles in order to see what you are trimming.  </li>
            <li> This is compared to my previous NORELCO Shaver with an internal charger.</li>
            <li> The three heads have small individual compartments for cut hair and must be cleaned out daily.</li>
            <li> The blades need to be smaller in diameter to cover less area on the face.</li>
            <li> The comfort is a totally different feel from the 9160 and feels less \\&quot;Manly\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It took me a half an hour to shave with this razor, which is longer than a regular shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We had to finally return the product back to amazon as I was not able to use it.</li>
            <li> It will probably be less by the time any of us actually need to buy replacements.  </li>
            <li> you have to open three small slots, instead pushing one button for one big chamber.  </li>
            <li> I have tried shaving wet, dry, with preshave gel and liquid.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd Phillips Norelco shaver I bought for him in the past several years, so brand loyalty is there.</li>
            <li> Sorry Norelco, but you have lost a loyal customer forever.</li>
            <li> and then I got bored and distracted and stopped using it almost as quickly as I started.  </li>
            <li> Other shavers leave the hair too long and cause ingrown chin and neck hairs, or \\&quot;Shave</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned 4 Norelco&#x27;s over 15 years and each new one is worse than the last one.  </li>
            <li> Some of the marketing claims: quick shave, 50% larger (than what???) are a little bit exaggerated but...</li>
            <li> For something that you will be using several times a week, I would put down a few extra $$ and get a nicer model.</li>
            <li> I have found the Arcitec to out perform the 8825XL in the time it takes me to shave and shaving in  tight shaving areas below the sideburns and upper lip.</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s beard is probably a little different, but I do not find this razor lacking at all in shaving performance, it shaves me closely and without burning.  </li>
            <li> That being said it&#x27;s not too small to hold and the 3 shaving heads are the same size as all other razors so it covers the same square footage.</li>
            <li> It did take  little getting used to for me, but it is no big deal.  </li>
            <li> On the plus side, after 2 months I poured a little isopropanol in the cup I got with Norelco cleaner fluid 15 years ago, stuck the razor head in it and ran the 1050 for 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> The biggest drawback is the tiny little trimmer, which is a joke and one does not realize it until one buy&#x27;s the product and opens it.</li>
            <li> A dull blade reduced the amount of deep cuts and nicks (but I would still have some to several) but also increased the time required to shave.  </li>
            <li> Hardly, but it&#x27;s worth at least four stars.</li>
            <li> Not much better than the conventional old style Norelcos without the \\&quot;neck.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s severely disappointing is that this razor was a HUGE step backward for Norelco</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t awful, but I just don&#x27;t get a great shave with this thing.</li>
            <li> read several comments about this product and those that were negative obviously were from competitors!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clumsy to open them and the razor is nosier because the heads are above the casing.</li>
            <li> I am 59 years old, I have used norelco electric razors for at least 35 years maybe longer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The chin is the roughest part of my beard, and I do have a rough beard.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> This is a problem is you purchase the 1050x model as you will not know when the battery is empty until it&#x27;s stops running.    </li>
            <li> The only way to use it when the battery is dead is to hold it in the charging bay while trying to shave.      </li>
            <li> So I guess Norelco expected me to leave work to go home and unplug after an hour or 2 then</li>
            <li> Contrary to some reviews, absolutely no razor rash.</li>
            <li> Still rough.</li>
            <li> The Braun&#x27;s trimmer is about twice as wide and zaps the hairs effortlessly.  </li>
            <li> If I need to shave and make minimal noise, the Norelco will be my choice.  </li>
            <li> The Braun&#x27;s trimmer is about twice as wide and zaps the hairs effortlessly.  </li>
            <li> If I need to shave and make minimal noise, the Norelco will be my choice.  </li>
            <li> I expected a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> Over the last few years, I swear my whiskers have felt like they were turning into wire.  </li>
            <li> I would pull the skin in all kinds of directions and drag the blade over the skin in all kinds of directions.  </li>
            <li> I would have expected for this price, they would have had the system regulate the charge.    </li>
            <li> To get a closeish shave I have to press harder and go over spots twice and stretch the skin.</li>
            <li> I spent hours</li>
            <li> if not longer to shave with this razor as a wet shave would take.</li>
            <li> The razor also has trouble around the corners of my mouth and under my nose area, probably for the same reasons.</li>
            <li> It seemed expensive but it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> If I didn&#x27;t wear a vandyke, I&#x27;d probably have to empty it twice.    </li>
            <li> I had to fully charge it to use it,and if I left the Arcitec off the charger,the battery drained itself dead.</li>
            <li> I call Philips/Norelco customer care, the shaver has a 2 year warranty, but not really.</li>
            <li> I am a lifelong Norelco user.</li>
            <li> Lastly, if while shaving you are unfortunate enough to get anywhere near to the hair on your head  with this wonder machine, it will suck it up like a Hoover from 3 inches away.</li>
            <li> Not very quit as razors go.  </li>
            <li> The cleaner is not necessary and a waste of time, money, and chemicals.  </li>
            <li> The cleaner is not necessary and a waste of time, money, and chemicals.  </li>
            <li> If you need to wash the head and then immediately store it when wet, this may be a problem</li>
            <li> I am a lifelong user of Norelco electric razors (20+ years).</li>
            <li> , a few months ago I realized my local stores didn&#x27;t stock my HQ5 Norelco replacement blades anymore</li>
            <li> no thanks..</li>
            <li> You will be paying for shipping and insurance and they are not responsible for lost items -</li>
            <li> I wil wet my face.</li>
            <li> By the way, if you like wet shaving, it looks like it can do that too.</li>
            <li> If you have a heavy beard, this shaver simply wont do the job.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> quiet (although perhaps more annoying)  -Cheaper than the Braun  </li>
            <li> It has bigger holes and causes the shaver to actually jam on a thick 2 day beard growth.</li>
            <li> As I ordered from a far away discounter and I tried the usual month thinking maybe my beard had to change again in some odd way to make this work--i noticed they sell one that comes with a Nivea dispenser-maybe will try that</li>
            <li> And when I say it  misses them, I mean it completely misses them.</li>
            <li> I have very curly whiskers, so they&#x27;re essentially flat ribbons that tend to confound normally-shaped shavers and make it difficult for me to get a close shave when using a razor.  </li>
            <li> I just bought the Arcitec 1050 at double the money of my previous Norelco that still works, but the battery is holding less of a charge now</li>
            <li> And, again, contrary to marketing claims, shaving with the Arcitec or with just about any other electric shaver is not &#x27;fast&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can fix this by pressing down, but that irritates the skin and is hard to do on a soft area like the neck.</li>
            <li> Not worth the extra trouble.</li>
            <li> It gives a decent shave but not a great shave like I was hoping</li>
            <li> It is hard to maneuver in tight areas such as at the upper lip and nose.</li>
            <li> Few months back I bought this shaver to upgrade from previous model</li>
            <li> The small hair collection chambers fill up and this thing spits hair all over the sink - gross.</li>
            <li> I have owned several other Norelco Razors in the past and this one just doesn&#x27;t work as well.  </li>
            <li> The price was excessive, but was acceptable with the following:    </li>
            <li> and I know my son is preoccupied with other aspects of his life</li>
            <li> It has other design problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read a few reviews who charge that the quality of this Norelco is not near that of their razors of years gone by.  </li>
            <li> So, why bother with any other shaver?  </li>
            <li> I an not aware of it</li>
            <li> Even some other $100</li>
            <li> I have 3 other razors that are about 1/8 the price of this one, like the cheap-o ones you get at walgreens</li>
            <li> The head remains sharp forever, and battery lasts a lifetime (I charge it 2x month max).</li>
            <li> the other Norelco&#x27;s I bought throughout my life.  </li>
            <li> Other</li>
            <li> I had not and would not even consider  buying any other brand of razor.</li>
            <li> Unlike every other Norelco</li>
            <li> Regarding the shave itself, it compares to every other norelco I&#x27;ve had, it gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> The other units would shut off after charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other units would shut off after charging.    </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need the other one with all the bells and whistles.</li>
            <li> I have owned several razors over the past 20 years.</li>
            <li> but, when I do I may appreciate how it protects my shaver but, on the other hand, I don&#x27;t believe any of my shavers was ever damaged while travelling</li>
            <li> but, when I do I may appreciate how it protects my shaver but, on the other hand, I don&#x27;t believe any of my shavers was ever damaged while travelling</li>
            <li> For the past several years, I have been using the Gillette Mach 3 and now the Fusion razors.  </li>
            <li> burn which I never got from my other Norelco.</li>
            <li> I was not accustomed to with other electric razors.</li>
            <li> I used it for three months and was totally unhappy about how many times I had to go over and over and press HARD to get it to cut.</li>
            <li> What ever happened to the simple Norelco technology: open the head, brush them out, and replace the blades when the shave gets poor.  </li>
            <li> This thing is the worst purchase of any kind I&#x27;ve ever made in  my entire life.</li>
            <li> Simply running it under the facet works for a few times but that does not get  everything out of the razor and it builds up over the course of a few days.    </li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver when my old Spectra 8894 needed new blades and I am very sorry that I did so.  </li>
            <li> Save your money and buy one of thier less expensive razors that have the old fashoned blades that actually shave.</li>
            <li> other thing I would mention is that it had a habit (especially toward the end of its life) of yanking on hair or two when I shaved with fairly thick stubble.</li>
            <li> My facial hair is not that hard to cut either.</li>
            <li> And forget the tiny trimmer, it is just too hard to use.</li>
            <li> It was also impossible to get a clean line for my sideburns.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;1) impossible to clean the heads.</li>
            <li> 1090x is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I either have difficult skin or just expect way too much out of these things.  </li>
            <li> and it is just average and not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Arcitec shaver for about 3 years now and have very mixed feelings, though mostly negative, about it.  </li>
            <li> I can only guess that the negative reviews that I see here were made by some shills from Braun.  </li>
            <li> I looks good but the shave is terrible.  </li>
            <li> It felt harsh and rough going over my skin.    </li>
            <li> I travel frequently for work, and got tired of having to remember to toss it in my travel bag every time I go out of town.  </li>
            <li> alas Norelco my old co.</li>
            <li> Nothing too awful, but a surprising jolt now and then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is extremely frustrating and I will never waste my money on another Norelco product.</li>
            <li> The little half inch wide trimmer is a joke.</li>
            <li> I would give it a half a star if possible, but I am forced to stick with the minimum allowed 1 star.</li>
            <li> Its gone from 2 years down to 7 or 8 months for me.</li>
            <li> Thumbs down Norelco...BG</li>
            <li> However, as my face has become accustomed to the electric, the time has come down some to around 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> There is a diminishing point of return on time verses close shave which is why I think the shaving time will come down as I decide where that point is.    </li>
            <li> Either drop down a model and save some $$$$$ or go with a Panasonic.</li>
            <li> My wiskers just don&#x27;t like jumping into those foil holes, they want to lay down.</li>
            <li> It mows down the whiskers without any ripping or pulling.</li>
            <li> My neck would always have left over hair, which would mean that I would have to shave the way I normally did earlier with my razor and cream, so it does not make sense at all for me at least to buy this product and sadly, it does not work for me.</li>
            <li> cleaning it every one or two times due to the reduced \\&quot;waste hair\\&quot; capacity.  </li>
            <li> Lately, it would take a few days to dull but would only last a few days.  </li>
            <li> Takes longer to shave than previous models.</li>
            <li> It offers a really uncomfortable, rough shave.</li>
            <li> It took no time to adapt to its shaving system which I attributed to having used a previous Norelco electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> I do know that materials are lighter and this often is used to explain less quality.  </li>
            <li> The 1050x solves both problems, I can shave in less time (must be the blades it uses)</li>
            <li> less than a one hour charge time.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Arcitec about 2 years ago,and it DID give me the closest shave I ever got from an electric,with less irritation.</li>
            <li> I returned a previous model that did not work well for me and received my refund check within a month.</li>
            <li> I would seriously consider trying a Phillips or Braun foil razor the next time around, given the reviews I&#x27;ve read.</li>
            <li> I just dropped a star from my previous 3 and still feel like I&#x27;m being generous.</li>
            <li> I could get the  job done in less than 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> The Norelco 1050 shaves a bit closer than my previous Norelco.</li>
            <li> With my previous Norelco I would square up my sideburns with the trimmer perpendicular to my head.</li>
            <li> Previously, I had two Braun razors, one Remington and used the manual shave (shaving cream etc.)</li>
            <li> it is hidden under the shaving heads and you can not see it..</li>
            <li> The less pin-holes the</li>
            <li> Shaving on the contour of neck and chin was easier then previous before.</li>
            <li> The mustache and sideburn trimmer is placed below the razor head in the back and is useless without a second mirror.  </li>
            <li> My previous Norelco the \\&quot;James Bond\\&quot; Spectra has served me well.  </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s debunk a couple of design complaints I have read about in previous reviews...      </li>
            <li> The battery supposedly can be damaged by over charging, unlike previous models.  </li>
            <li> Having had previous Norelco models as well as a Remington and a couple Brauns...</li>
            <li> and you also don&#x27;t get the range of pivoting that the previous models have</li>
            <li> As others state, it is not able to deal with hairs on the neck, and takes twice as long as the other Philips shavers i used in the past.</li>
            <li> Arcitec design looks fancy and works well, but gets three average stars because it really works no better than the previous non-space-age, less expensive designs.  </li>
            <li> Many other newer models have lots of little pin-holes which are worthless, as the hairs have no time to enter a small hole with shaving motion.  </li>
            <li> Not true of this one.  </li>
            <li> But, in this day and age of \\&quot;green\\&quot; and trying to save energy, this one is not cool.  </li>
            <li> Also as others noted the razor will not hold the whiskers when shaving and will make a mess.</li>
            <li> The chambers for clippings storage are ridiculously small and you need to empty them after each use.</li>
            <li> Bought it as there was this 45 days not good money back garantee.</li>
            <li> charging pod, on the other hand, is a little too bulky and it&#x27;s not easy to close/open and it can&#x27;t store then shaver while the heads cap is on.</li>
            <li> The charging pod, on the other hand, is a little too bulky and it&#x27;s not easy to close/open and it can&#x27;t store then shaver while the heads cap is on.</li>
            <li> I did not find that the razor bogged down, nor did it pull or snag on any hairs as some claimed it would.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried stretching my skin so  tight that the skin on my neck was pulled up to my earlobe</li>
            <li> This was my first electric shaver and I really wanted to like it, having gotten it for my birthday; however, shaving with it is miserable.</li>
            <li> However, I assumed that this shaver would get a little closer than it does.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind cleaning up a little.  </li>
            <li> It just takes a little longer.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s this little ridge on the backside of the shaver.</li>
            <li> The Norelco Arcitec has a little \\&quot;head replacement\\&quot; indicator.  </li>
            <li> It just takes a little longer.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s this little ridge on the backside of the shaver.</li>
            <li> The Norelco Arcitec has a little \\&quot;head replacement\\&quot; indicator.  </li>
            <li> I took me at least 3 times as long to get a mediocre shave verses my 4 year old shaver.</li>
            <li> Yes, one can use the little brush,  or just blow it out.  </li>
            <li> I usually shave every day and with every other Norelco</li>
            <li> Also the width of the trimmer could be a little wider.</li>
            <li> if I let my hair grow a little</li>
            <li> so much for cutting shaving time by half :</li>
            <li> Panasonic wet shaving model was also not very successful.</li>
            <li> May not have helped that those first few weeks were very cold and dry.  </li>
            <li> I rarely leave feedback, but this shaver is so bad</li>
            <li> and it is impossible to clean because you can&#x27;t remove the cutting blades from the heads like you could with the old Norelcos.</li>
            <li> I addition this model is messy; there is no chamber for the the clippings</li>
            <li> and I do not have a heavy beard.  </li>
            <li> Overall it gave a worse shave than the braun</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel anything like the reports of \\&quot;heavy tugging\\&quot; at the whiskers.</li>
            <li> So, I make another few passes.</li>
            <li> This razor is not great for someone who shaves rarely,like once a week or who has a thich coarse hair.</li>
            <li> As it kept missing them, they got longer and would not get cut at all.</li>
            <li> and they all out do this waste of space.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable but it does not shave for crap</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Arcitec 1050 for about 3 months and like it with a few caveats.  </li>
            <li> I have to empty it at least once during a shave.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t put anything on my face and even after a few days of not shaving I can still use my Philips shaver and not feel the slightest pinch :</li>
            <li> On few occasions I even did it while driving a car.</li>
            <li> Overall this is worse</li>
            <li> I wasted $190.</li>
            <li> I am trying to find out if there is a way I can return it because it is a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> If you miss a few days shaving forget it.  </li>
            <li> It shaves poorly, because it cannot be cleaned properly.</li>
            <li> if I touch up in a few areas with the arcitec I can get closer in a few spots</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this razor for a few years and I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> I was using any number of triple blade razors with no problems except that they are messy having to use shaving cream</li>
            <li> Performance - I do not have a heavy beard.</li>
            <li> + is poorly manufactured and has the following problems.</li>
            <li> So, I would shave very carefully until the blade was dull.  </li>
            <li> Immediately after a shave, I can feel a very slight bumpiness from my un cut beard.</li>
            <li> Now the geniuses that made this piece of junk cleverly decided to make the cutting head all one  piece.</li>
            <li> After a week of use, on the older models you can see they need thorough cleaning as residue accumulates at the cutting  edge.</li>
            <li> and I get disappointed about my purchase day by day due to the following reasons: Misses hair a lot especiall in the neck area, causes rashes, and requires mini scissors or actual blade to get rid of missed neck hair.....</li>
            <li> This arcitec is the most expensive and the most worthless piece of crap I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> And, there is not a good solution to this problem on the internet and the manual is no real help.</li>
            <li> (not great) as long as I shave every day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time blad user and was just tired of it.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s frustrating is that it&#x27;ll cut maybe 80% of the hair, but then somehow the heads won&#x27;t pick up the remaining hairs, leaving some long hair (amid shaved patches) that I have to get with a blade.  </li>
            <li> I have to shave with a blade after shaving with this poor excuse for a shaver.</li>
            <li> My face was raw for two days after I quit using it.</li>
            <li> I was excited and wanted to prove all these other bad reviews wrong.</li>
            <li> I was excited and wanted to prove all these other bad reviews wrong.</li>
            <li> Also, the Arcitec has very little space beneath the cutters to hold the beard clippings, so you have to wash the heads after every use.</li>
            <li> However a few times when I pressed hard for close shave</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve ever wasted time writing a review, but I HATE this razor.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m past the 30-day return period now.      </li>
            <li> This design is made to attract, but the shave is no better than the Norelcos I have had for years.  </li>
            <li> Each shave usually takes me 3-4 minutes.    </li>
            <li> i no longer use blade to do finer shave which i use to do while using ordinary electric shavers.</li>
            <li> the Norelco 1050X is too small for a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; sized hand.  </li>
            <li> not sure how this is done (number of shaves?).  </li>
            <li> not sure how this is done (number of shaves?).  </li>
            <li> After 30 years of Phillips/Norelcos, no more Norelcos for me.</li>
            <li> This is the worst of the many Norelco that I have owned.  </li>
            <li> small beard/sideburn trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Also, the whisker chamber is too small.</li>
            <li> It was so heavy, it felt like pushing a lawn mower across my face!  </li>
            <li> The arcitec is a shaver, not a trimmer; I am not lowering my rating of the arcitec based on its small precision trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it wore out and the only one of the blades still cuts.</li>
            <li> I always end up back with Norelco, and sadly, this one was not a keeper for me.   </li>
            <li> To small.    </li>
            <li> them back in is kinda silly.</li>
            <li> have had a Norelco 5885XL for the past 13 years.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I am not sure it is a coincident with me</li>
            <li> small trimmer can be pulled out when needed.</li>
            <li> Yes, the trimmer may be a bit small, but I have a small face, and I almost never usea trimmer, so no biggie.  </li>
            <li> I did it all afternoon and evening yesterday with no notable problems.    </li>
            <li> So my thrifty wife, knowing I had used Norelcos in the past, picked up the Arcitec shaver on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Braun by comparison, can usually go a week before cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have an unusually tough beard and have not ever had any problems like this with any of my other Norelcos.</li>
            <li> Like all other razors I have tried, it left an unpleasant rash and did not clip the hairs closely.</li>
            <li> It gives a very poor shave and causes razor burn at the same time.</li>
            <li> I first heeded these negative warnings and went with another product (to remain unnamed) and was majorly disappointed.</li>
            <li> If you have a mustache, this one just doesn&#x27;t perform well at all; just too small and hard to use.  </li>
            <li> As other reviewers point out, this razor is very harsh on my skin and in fact the third time I used it it gave me a bad case of razor burn in my adams apple area that resulted in scarring (since healed).</li>
            <li> That does not mean that the Braun or Panasonic models are bad, their technology does just not adapt to my skin and my hair.</li>
            <li> I have to use the beard trimmer to get the ones that the cutting heads missed, generally on my neck.  </li>
            <li> The shaver is not perfect, but the disadvantages are minor in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> After reading all of the bad reviews on this new Norelco shaver, I swore I was not going to buy this</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product did not live up to expectations.</li>
            <li> It is concealed behind the large rotary heads, even when it is extended it is nearly impossible to use.  </li>
            <li> It especially is difficult to shave longer hairs on the neck, I found myself getting impatient and pulling out a razor to quickly finish the job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine for sideburns, terrible for my mustache.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is a joke and also hardly works.  </li>
            <li> The blades aren&#x27;t dull since there is no pulling, but it just doesn&#x27;t want to cut.</li>
            <li> but after a couple of days the blades seemed to get dull.</li>
            <li> Spray some  cleaner on the head and put it in the container of water and shake it around as hard as you can for  a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to tell when it&#x27;s deployed.</li>
            <li> It comes with a hard carrying case.</li>
            <li> I decided to finally \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; from my 7 year old Norelco with dull blades to this model and have been very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a die hard Norelco fan.</li>
            <li> The travel case is made of hard plastic and does not have room for the charger, but it does have the capability to charge the razor, so you do not need to bring along the charging stand.</li>

            <li> It seems like its always dull, even with</li>
            <li> And whoever complained about the cleaning of the Norelco needs a butler.....</li>
            <li> At least that I know off.</li>
            <li> I am a Norelco shaver user for at least 20 years.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is a minuscule idiocy with the head in the way.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor: ignore the fancy Norelco marketing and the glitzy packaging, and look at the negative reviews on here.  </li>
            <li> I had to shave with a blade at least once per week to supplement the Arcitec.  </li>
            <li> it was too late</li>
            <li> Duh.    </li>
            <li> The arcitec shaver is the least of three Norelco shavers that I use.</li>
            <li> , you also get the pleasure of stopping and emptying the hair  chambers at least twice during each shave.</li>
            <li> The one negative is the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I cannot believe some of the negative reviews on this product.  </li>
            <li> Those who say \\&quot;cleans easily\\&quot; don&#x27;t realize that rinsing the cutting head only cleans it superficially.</li>
            <li> The AC adapter cable does not even fit into the travel case, how stupid is that!?!</li>
            <li> The AC adapter cable does not even fit into the travel case, how stupid is that!?!</li>
            <li> Take negative opinions with a grain of salt.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this shaver at least 3 times a week for about 2 years.</li>
            <li> so I am now forced to spend money on something else.  </li>
            <li> it gives the impression that the shaver is a slow, antiquated device.</li>
            <li> A side switch partially extends and activates it, a small bank of cutting teeth.  </li>
            <li> A side switch partially extends and activates it, a small bank of cutting teeth.  </li>
            <li> I suspect that caused the failure.  </li>
            <li> My son wanted to like it too, but we both concluded that it&#x27;s a failure.  </li>
            <li> Nevertheless, I really do feel like this shaver gives a really bad, uncomfortable shave.</li>
            <li> This latter position is impossible with the 1050.</li>
            <li> the points that matter most, it fails miserably.  </li>
            <li> There is one serious design flaw that should be noted.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is still a little expensive (mine happened to be a gift), but it is well made and should provide years of service.</li>
            <li> is that little side-burn/mustache trimmer, its useless.</li>
            <li> area little bit exaggerated but...</li>
            <li> - I am on my way to trash can after writing this review to dump the Philips razor - an expensive waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Meaning, you need to be around when recharging to unplug it after it is charged; not good for those that shave and must go to work.  </li>
            <li> Meaning, you need to be around when recharging to unplug it after it is charged; not good for those that shave and must go to work.  </li>
            <li> This is not good.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver and tried it for a couple of weeks and found it delivers a really harsh uncomfortable shave with lots of razor</li>
            <li> It is not only the worst shaver I ever tried, It&#x27;s the first bad Norelco</li>
            <li> Some people have complained having to replace them at 6 months, while an acquaintance says he replaces the heads every 10 years--when he changes shavers!  </li>
            <li> Some people have complained having to replace them at 6 months, while an acquaintance says he replaces the heads every 10 years--when he changes shavers!  </li>
            <li> It has a microprocessor chip in it (why so complex?!)</li>
            <li> Not worth the money for a razor with cutting issues.  </li>
            <li> Pretty terrible outcome for forgetting to unplug the shaver- one morning.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave as close unless one presses very hard and shaves longer.  </li>
            <li> and it has a VERY hard time.</li>
            <li> The bad news&gt;&gt;It runs off a single 1.3 v AA (penlight) nicad cell</li>
            <li> I am very  disappointed in Norelco for charging so much for a piece of junk.</li>
            <li> However, I guess it is tough, as this shaver took forever to shave the easiest shaves.</li>
            <li> It is very, very slow to cut on 1 day growth (for me) and virtually doesn&#x27;t work at all on 2 or 3 day growth.</li>
            <li> I have a very thick beard and it just doesn&#x27;t get everything.</li>
            <li> Positioned under the cutters makes it almost impossible to trim other places.  </li>
            <li> I have never had a battery failure on a razor before!  </li>
            <li> no thanks..      --Bad</li>
            <li> But the shave is poor.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shave everyday and the blades on this razor are not cable of cutting longer whiskers.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco shavers for 20 years, but this one is poorly designed.  </li>
            <li> No..it cuts neck hair worse.  </li>
            <li> Poor design (1050x, 1060x, 1090x):    </li>
            <li> I bought this shaver approximately 6 months ago.</li>
            <li> And one thing is definitely worse.  </li>
            <li> The results were poor, it seemed to take forever to shave, and it missed a lot of hairs.  </li>
            <li> so that was a bit irritating but livable.    </li>
            <li> What are people with negative reviews doing wrong with this razor?  </li>
            <li> Alas, this was not the case.</li>
            <li> The floating head design (which attracted me to the shaver) was the thing that made it a poor shaver and despite wanting to like it, I returned it...</li>
            <li> All you can do is stick the cleaning brush that they  give you (which is asbig a piece of junk as the razor) in behind the cutters and try to scrape out  what you can while spinning the cutter around and around.</li>
            <li> My grandpa is shedding a tear in heaven-a family tradition may be broken if this keeps up..</li>
            <li> Outdated battery technology (1050x, 1060x, 1090x):    </li>
            <li> Small and in an awkward position.</li>
            <li> But this new generation of aritec shavers are awful!  </li>
            <li> BUT, one of the complaints I have read several times is that placement is bad because \\&quot;you end up cutting your hair with the razor when you try to use the trimmer\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> It would leave random hair on my face and attempts to angle the shaver were not successful.</li>
            <li> It is by far the worst shaver I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the trimmer is very small and difficult to use because you have to see what you are doing around the cutting heads.  </li>
            <li> I have replaced the blades a number of times - they are expensive - with no improvement.  </li>
            <li> Useless.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, the highest priced item is not best, and this is the case.  </li>
            <li> It is really lame.     </li>
            <li> The fact of the matter is that this razor is lousy.  </li>
            <li> That sounds a bit unrealistic to me.  </li>
            <li> That sounds a bit unrealistic to me.  </li>
            <li> This time I figured I&#x27;d go all out and get the expensive model.  </li>
            <li> Boy, did I make the wrong choice.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I need an industrial strength razor.</li>
            <li> It does a lousy job on my neck.    </li>
            <li> Sorry I waisted my money!!!&lt;br /&gt;Steve</li>
            <li> Sad.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, they are correct in every way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sadly, they are correct in every way.    </li>
            <li> but my neck still felt uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t and still am not impressed with the so-called cleaning system that Bruan has designed.</li>
            <li> Sorry Norelco</li>
            <li> Sorry, Norelco has NO OPTIONS for that replacement.</li>
            <li> This a very poor product.  </li>
            <li> It does three things very poorly.  </li>
            <li> Very poorly designed trimmer</li>
            <li> Very poorly designed trimmer</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m stuck with a worthless razor that is not capable of cutting all of the hairs, let along cutting them close.  </li>
            <li> The bad news is that the razor I bought to replace this one costs a lot less than I paid for the cutting head!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: This razor has gone from bad to worse.</li>
            <li> I was getting tired, frustrated, and irritated.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Assuming that one carries the shaver in the power pod when traveling (its like a travel case), its disappointing that there is no room for the power cord in that pod.</li>
            <li> chipper  when it is cutting.</li>
            <li> One for each cutting head.</li>
            <li> And no, you do not end up cutting your hair as some have reported.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The three cutting tracks help shave me faster.</li>
            <li> The three cutting tracks help shave me faster.</li>
            <li> I got it but unhappy with it.</li>
            <li> I get mad.</li>
            <li> WTF!</li>
            <li> Useless!</li>
            <li> Wrong!</li>
            <li> Then I skipped a day of shaving and had a very difficult time getting the longer hairs to cut.</li>
            <li> Very expensive, however.</li>
            <li> Finally this is a Terrible shaver, the worst Philips I bought</li>
            <li> but if you have to go into a corner the design of the heads get in the way and make it almost impossible.</li>
            <li> but it gets really bad on the chin and the neck.</li>
            <li> From day 1 the razor performed badly.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t even think about de-soldering the bad battery and replacing it.  </li>
            <li> The shave was so bad</li>
            <li> To bad about the power chord</li>
            <li> The sideburn trimmer really is bad, I am not nit-picking here.    </li>
            <li> So in conclusion, just how bad is this razor?    </li>
            <li> /&gt;--What a bad shave.</li>
            <li> it was painful to write, but here goes..</li>
            <li> but you won&#x27;t be disappointed in the performance.  </li>
            <li> I am really disappointed with the results from this shaver.</li>
            <li> Boy, was I disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed in the shaver.  </li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li> You will probably be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco for over 30 years and found the Arcitec to be: (1.)</li>
            <li> :(     </li>
            <li> If you expect the Arcitec to fulfill all the marketing claims, you may be slightly disappointed</li>
            <li> If you expect the Arcitec to fulfill all the marketing claims, you may be slightly disappointed</li>
            <li> What a disappointment!</li>
            <li> a disappointment!</li>
            <li> If you are a Norelco user and you like the \\&quot;look\\&quot; of the Arcetec style, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This shaver was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, looking at this shaver, one gets the sense that its just stupid.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m stuck with this crap.</li>
            <li> Buy a shaver using razor blades instead of buying this horror dreamed by some retarded \\&quot;designer.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The shaver comes with a charging base that serves as a resting stand, which secures the razor magnetically--very tasteful.</li>
            <li> This thing is a piece of crap.</li>
            <li> This  piece of crap was no exception.</li>
            <li> and it was quite annoying.</li>
            <li> the trimmer is crap and it cuts like crap.</li>
            <li> it quit charging and is now worthless.</li>
            <li> I always hated having a bunch of hair gather in my razor.    </li>
            <li> I have been very disappointed with the Arcitec razor.</li>
            <li> I read and followed all the directions but was very disappointed in this razor.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry!!!</li>

            <li> This is the worst Norelco razor I have owned.  </li>
            <li> it is terrible.</li>
            <li> It gives you the absolutely worst shave have ever gotten with an electric razor.</li>
            <li> I have never written a review on Amazon, but this product is so bad I had to do something!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Norelco razors but this model is terrible.</li>

            <li> This thing is inches away from my ears at 5am and that is very annoying.</li>
            <li> What the heck is it with this terrible charging system.</li>
            <li> What the heck is it with this terrible charging system.</li>
            <li> Its the worst shaver Norelco has ever made.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> pros:it certainly looks very cool, it is light and easy to handle, not noisy    cons: expensive, but most importantly not a close shaver. I would rate my facial hair thickness as average and unfortunately i have not been able to get a close shave although i persisted using it hoping it would improve. The shave is not bad on the cheeks but it gets really bad on the chin and the neck. I will give it to my brother, hopefully it will work on him.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews before this purchase and still bought the product despite the crappy reviews. I have come up with the conclusion that most of you work for the competition, or you would whine if someone gave you a hundred dollar bill with a wrinkle in it, or you are still trying to figure out how toilet paper works.    From the first shave I absolutely love this shaver, it gives the closest shave and by far the most comfortable shave of all the high end electric shavers I have ever owned, and I have owned many! It is light, stylish and the trimmer you all complain about is awesome. All you have to do is pull the head off and you have a stand alone trimmer that is just the right size.     After using this shaver I would recommend it to everyone, and would not think twice about buying another one for myself or as a gift.</li>
            <li> I have been using electric razors since 1962. Most have been Norelcos. I purchased the Arcitec 5 months ago and stopped using it 2 months ago. The first week I was reasonably satisfied with the new razor and the closeness of the shave. Then I skipped a day of shaving and had a very difficult time getting the longer hairs to cut. I found that after two days I had to use a disposable razor to shave. The Arcitec won&#x27;t shave long thin neck hair either, so I have to use the straight razor there as well. After the second week I found I had to scrub my face with the razor to get a good shave. After the forth week on that blade I could not get a good shave. I was cleaning the razors hair daily and washing the razor weekly. The instructions said to wash it regularly. I purchased a new blade and washed the razor every day. The trimmer would not cut nose or ear hair and it left the side burns so long that the regular razor cutting head could not trim them smooth. Now my side burns also required the use of  a different razor. After one month with the second blade, it also would not give a close shave. I purchased a third blade and for 3 weeks I got a decent shave but still with the above issues requiring the use of a straight razor. By the end of the third week on the third blade I was having trouble again getting a close shave. These blades were costing me more that one dollar a day to shave and giving a poor shave at the three week mark. I have since gone back to using disposable twin blade razors now.      After reading some of the positive reviews; I don&#x27;t understand why their experiences can be so radically different than mine. If I got a lemon ok, but I put three different heads on that Norelco and all had the same results. I don&#x27;t have an unusually tough beard and have not ever had any problems like this with any of my other Norelcos. That&#x27;s almost 40 years. One thing I can say is: over the years the time between blade replacements has gotten shorter. Its gone from 2 years down to 7 or 8 months for me. The older Norelco cut fine and the blades lasted more than a year.  I am very  disappointed in Norelco for charging so much for a piece of junk. I am offering to sell my 3 months old used Norelco Arcitec to any of those who have written those positive reviews cheap for $75. If you really like them so much how can you pass up a deal like that? I have only used Norelco for 40 years and have never tried Braun. Perhaps they have gone the same way as well. I don&#x27;t know. I am retired now and won&#x27;t pay one dollar a day to shave. Over the years there has been a steady decline in cycle time of the blade replacement and an increase in price. I have gone back to straight razors for awhile until I can find a better way.    With such a diverse range of opinions on this item: how does one make a decision? 60 Day free trial sounds like the way to go. If I had done that I would not be writing this.

            <li> First time I&#x27;ve ever wasted time writing a review, but I HATE this razor. The small hair collection chambers fill up and this thing spits hair all over the sink - gross. One of the blades broke (admittedly after a year of use) but I ended up slicing up my face. Thumbs down Norelco...BG</li>
            <li> This razor is very comfortable.  The pivoting heads conform to the lines of my face quite well, however the razor leaves many long hairs behind.  I need a close shave for my work, and what this provides is unacceptable.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco shavers for many years. After purchasing this one, I passed on my \\&quot;cool skin\\&quot; to my cousin which still works great.&lt;br /&gt;The Philips Norelco arcitec 1050 Men&#x27;s Shaver gives the smoothest shave I have ever received, even better than the old fashioned shaving cream and razors!&lt;br /&gt;I read several comments about this product and those that were negative obviously were from competitors!&lt;br /&gt;The chin is the roughest part of my beard, and I do have a rough beard.&lt;br /&gt;This razor took the beard off with very little force and the best part is the way the heads conform to the chin area.&lt;br /&gt;I always say \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Norelco!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a big fan of Norelco.  My last Norelco lasted 14 years and gave a pretty decent shave the whole time.  I replaced a few batteries and quite a few cutters, but overall it was great.    Not true of this one.  On the positive side, the mechanism they designed for this is very clever.  In theory it should follow the contours of your face really well.  It&#x27;s a good looking shaver, too.  Very cool blue LEDs and all that.  But the shave is poor.  I go over and over the same area and it just doesn&#x27;t get everything.  It&#x27;s not even like you need to touch your skin to assess the closeness; you can SEE that it&#x27;s not getting stuff, even if you do it over and over again.  Norelco says to keep using it, that performance gets better with time, but I&#x27;m not seeing it and I&#x27;m past the 30-day return period now.      In short, this is really a sub par shaver, and the price for this poor performance is high.  I would strongly suggest looking elsewhere.  If you do buy it, realize that the performance after 8 weeks is not going to be any different than the performance after 3, and return it if you don&#x27;t love it.  This is just way too much to spend on a shaver that, in my opinion, works little better than a toy.</li>
            <li> If you are a road warrior you better keep your old razor.  Don&#x27;t be fooled by the Aritec&#x27;s sleek appearance, the hardshell travel case for the Arcitec is big.  You will not be able to throw this in a breifcase and go.  Even the countertop charging stand is big.    And bring a scissors; the tube clipper is ineffective.  It is concealed behind the large rotary heads, even when it is extended it is nearly impossible to use.  It can only be used in odd angles in order to see what you are trimming.  For example, I sometimes trim hair growing over my ears - but not with the Arcitec - you can&#x27;t trim in that direction.    On the plus side - the shaving head is very good and offers a nice close shave.  It says in the manual that you have to use this razor for a while to get used to it.  I had no trouble adjusting to the shave, but the jury is out on the other aspects of what makes a good electric razor.  Recommendation - unless you just like the novelty and asthetics - look for a more practical razor.</li>
            <li> this is a great product.  It does what it says it will do.  My husband is older and every other electric shaver he  ever used always left his skin red and irrateded.   The norelco shaver didnt grab his skin and left no   reddness.   He just loves it and would reccomend it to  anyone wanting a good shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the hype, the review, &amp; the good name of the manufacturer.  Unfortunately this product did not live up to expectations. First, it took twice as long  to shave. Second, it left my face mutilated, irritated,&amp; scratched. To get a close shave  I had to go over &amp; over the same spots.    I&#x27;ve used the shaver three times. I&#x27;ve gone back to my straight edge. I only wish there   was an electric that was efficient &amp; effective.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey but you won&#x27;t be disappointed in the performance.  The cutters have a lip around them that makes it awkward to be sure where you&#x27;re shaving but overall performance is terrific.  Cleaning is simple and battery life is great.  I recommend this to all that want a close and comfortable shave every time.  This was a very good purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco shavers my entire life with good results. But this new generation of aritec shavers are awful!  I don&#x27;t shave everyday and the blades on this razor are not cable of cutting longer whiskers. Anything longer than a five o clock shadow and this razor can&#x27;t handle it. I addition this model is messy; there is no chamber for the the clippings fall into. Thus your shirt, the floor and counter will be covered with clippings. Also on the downside, the side-burn trimmer is completely inadequate; it too tiny to be functional. I returned this model and bought Norelco&#x27;s cheapest model the 7110x and its infinitely better for only a fraction of the price!</li>
            <li> Had used Norelco over the last 10 years.  I have been very disappointed with the Arcitec razor. Takes longer to shave than previous models. The travel case should me more user friendly.</li>
            <li> My husband has a \\&quot;barbed wire\\&quot; beard and finding him a razor that gives a smooth, close and fast shave has always been a challange.  We saw the advertisement for this razor on television and he was interested.  I went online and priced it at many different \\&quot;stores\\&quot; but Amazon was best.  He got it for Christmas from Santa and he loves it.  It shaves quickly, close and easily.  Everything he wanted.</li>
            <li> I received this shaver as a Christmas gift, and returned it within a week.  I have used Norelco shavers for 20 years, but this one is poorly designed.  First, the trimmer is short and cuts your hair when you try to trim your sideburns.  Second, the blades are not replaceable, so you have to replace the whole head assembly.  Third, the cleaning system is bulky, and cumbersome.  What ever happened to the simple Norelco technology: open the head, brush them out, and replace the blades when the shave gets poor.  This design is made to attract, but the shave is no better than the Norelcos I have had for years.  I&#x27;m back to my old Norelco now.</li>
            <li> I purchased the 1050 to replace my old Phillips Quadra 6865 which needed new heads and rechargeable batteries. I am really disappointed with the results from this shaver. As other reviewers point out, this razor is very harsh on my skin and in fact the third time I used it it gave me a bad case of razor burn in my adams apple area that resulted in scarring (since healed). I now am very careful when I use it and this results in it taking longer to shave than my old razor. It can give me a smooth shave but it requires care and patience. I feel that the 1050 is a step backwards for Phillips. In the end I replaced the batteries and heads on my old Quadra and use it more than the 1050. I would recommend that if you are buying this shaver, make sure you can return it if you need to. One final thing. Several reviews here complain about the shaver head catching their hair when using the trimmer on sideburns. The manual tells you to remove the shaving head when using the trimmer.</li>
            <li> I bought this thing to replace an older floating head style Philips Norelco that I dropped and broke.  Considering the price tag and sleek design, I figured I was in for a good shave.  Boy, was I disappointed.  This is my third and most expensive Norelco, and it doesn&#x27;t come close to either of the previous models I have owned in terms of performance.   It does okay (not great) as long as I shave every day.  For more than 24 hours of stubble, I have to break out the shave cream and disposable razors.  I have to admit, though, it looks slick, like modern art.</li>
            <li> I have owned other Norelco razors and liked them very much, except for the problematic neck hairs. Yet this razor was absolutely horrible. It offers a really uncomfortable, rough shave. I was so horrified by their \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; model, that I went for a braun instead. It seems to me that they beefed up the aesthetics of this model while sacrificing the integrity of the shave. I would give it a half a star if possible, but I am forced to stick with the minimum allowed 1 star.</li>
            <li> This is the worst Norelco razor I have owned.  I regret getting rid of my old Norelco before trying this one.  If you try to go longer than a couple days without shaving, it is an aboslute CHORE with this razor.  I have to go over a single patch of hair ten times to even see skin.  I have never had a clean smooth shave with this razor.  If you shave every day, I can see how it is tolerable, but it still does not cut hair well.    Oh and the sleek design that cuts neck hair better?  No..it cuts neck hair worse.  Any Norelco is better than this one.  There is a reason why the moment this thing hit stores the commercials stopped airing..it is terrible.</li>
            <li> Received this shaver as a present last year. The booklet says that the head should last six months; it doesn&#x27;t.  I still have several older Norelco models for comparison, one in my travel case, and one in my RV.  The older two, overall work better.  The new Norelco is lighter than the others which seems to require pressing harder with it to get a closer shave.  The built-in trimmer is small and effective.  For this old guy it even works on eyebrows and nosehair (I know, gross!).    Pros:      Sleeker, more style.    Trimmer works well.    The complete head is changed for a new, one piece, bladed head; takes seconds to change.    Cons:      Expensive, by comparison with other models currently available.    Doesn&#x27;t shave as close unless one presses very hard and shaves longer.  Takes longer to get a good, close shave.    Charger doesn&#x27;t fit in travel case.    Replacement heads do not last the stated six months; three months is more like it, and they are pricey.    Still a fan of Norelco, but not the newest model of this type.</li>
            <li> I read the pro and con comments on the Norelco Arcitec 1050 and made the purchase....nothing but positive returns here.  Someone said it&#x27;s noisy....not so compared to my old Braun 7550 which I was buying blades for every couple of months..and I do not have a heavy beard.  The Norelco gives me a close shave...with my Braun I used to have to use a hand razor for my neck.  And whoever complained about the cleaning of the Norelco needs a butler.....you pop open the 3 rotary blades, run under the sink for 10 seconds, hitting each blade and it&#x27;s perfectly clean for the next use.  I got about 30 days worth of shaving before having to recharge. Bottom line here, totally happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Outdated battery technology (1050x, 1060x, 1090x):    If you leave the razor in it&#x27;s charging bay when its fully charged you will deplete the battery live. The manual also states not only should the razor not be left in the charger but it should be charged when the razor is nearly empty or you shorten the battery life.    This is a problem is you purchase the 1050x model as you will not know when the battery is empty until it&#x27;s stops running.    The other problem is the battery can not be easily replaced in any of the models.    The 1090x costs as much as an ipod so I would expect it to at least have an intelligent charging system.      Charging pod and charging stand:    Why do I need two charging systems? I would prefer to have a stand and a way to connect the cord directly to the razor.    Leave out the pod and give me a battery charging system all together. My toothbrush has a more thought out charging system. Ever hear of contact-less charging? Might be a good idea for something that gets wet.      Poor design (1050x, 1060x, 1090x):    If the engineers would actually use this razor they would notice that removing the abaility for you to connect the razor directly to the charging cable is a problem. How many times have you had to get to work and the razor had a low battery? Sometimes you need to use the shaver will it&#x27;s plugged in.     The only way to use it when the battery is dead is to hold it in the charging bay while trying to shave.      Noise:    This unit is louder than the old (9170XL) style units. This isn&#x27;t really a problem but I would think that is something they would improve from razor to razor.      Shaving quality:    I didn&#x27;t notice much difference between this unit and the old (9170XL) style when it comes to the quality of the shave. You still need to go over the same areas multiple times. The head design is very similar to the old (9170XL) one so I didn&#x27;t expect much difference.      Options:    There aren&#x27;t any. At least that I know off. TheBraun shavers don&#x27;t provide as good as a shave from my experience so I&#x27;m stuck with this crap. The only reason I got this new one in the first place was because the 9170XL I have broke (plastic piece of the head broke of because of cheap design).    Can someone please design and build a better electric razor?     If you have to get one go for the next model up 1060x. 1090x is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have owned several other Norelco Razors in the past and this one just doesn&#x27;t work as well.  It gives you a very uncomfortable shave, misses areas all together, and doesn&#x27;t work nearly as good as their previous razors.  Also - you basically have to clean it every day which is an awkward process because you have to individually lift each razor head and wash it out.  Fortunately, this razor got lost on a cross country flight so I am now forced to spend money on something else.  Sadly - good riddance!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Arcitec 1050 12/29/08 and it arrived on the 1/7/09.  The razor provides a very nice close shave smooth shave for me.  It took no time to adapt to its shaving system which I attributed to having used a previous Norelco electric shaver.  I have yet to get a razor burn on a nick with the shaver.  It is still operating on its original charge; 11 days and eleven shaves.  Each shave usually takes me 3-4 minutes.    I like that it is easily cleaned in the sink every morning and the heads mold very well to my face as I shave.    I do not like the cheap trimmer.  It appears to be an engineering after thought.  I suspect it was only added so that when one makes a comparison to other razors, the trimmer doesn&#x27;t exclude the Arcitec.  If your like me and try to stretch a periods between a haircut by using a shaver trimmer, you will need to by a separate trimer.    The price was excessive, but was acceptable with the following:    *  Get $50 off a future Amazon.com purchase when you spend $149 or more on eligible Norelco, Sonicare, Bliss Philips, and Tresemme products offered by Amazon.com, including this item. Here&#x27;s how (restrictions apply). Offer valid through January 31, 2009.    (Have not received my Amazon Gift Card as advertised)    * $20 Gift card from Philips Norelco to be used on the purchase of a Philips Norelco product.    (Had to nag Philips Norelco for the $20 gift card, but it did come)    I deducted two stars for the following reasons:  Price &amp; Trimmer</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver approximately 6 months ago. From day 1 the razor performed badly. It is very, very slow to cut on 1 day growth (for me) and virtually doesn&#x27;t work at all on 2 or 3 day growth. My facial hair is not that hard to cut either. I have replaced the blades a number of times - they are expensive - with no improvement.  The trimmer is a joke and also hardly works.  I just bought a Panasonic ES8043SC Pro-Curve razor as a replacement - it works great - I am on my way to trash can after writing this review to dump the Philips razor - an expensive waste of money.  Philips - shame - shame...</li>
            <li> I bought this product as a gift for my 24 year old son.  He says it is, by far, the best shaver he has ever owned.  I bought it because it claimed to be self-cleaning and I know my son is preoccupied with other aspects of his life so this was a must.  That turned out to be one of the things he liked most.  The most important thing... It doesn&#x27;t cause skin irritation or break outs.  This is a must for men who like convenience but still care about their skin.</li>
            <li> I have shaved with electric razors all my life. When my old Remington shaver&#x27;s battery started to die I decided to change for a new razor. This was the coolest looking so I got it. Unfortunately it only works for that- looking cool in your sink. It gives you the absolutely worst shave have ever gotten with an electric razor. Read most of the 5 star review they only praise the looks. My single blade electric shaver works better. Even with multiple passes it won&#x27;t give you a close shave. Useless. I changed the blades thinking that may be the issue but it works the same.   It has other design problems. For example you cannot charge the razor unless its on the stand or in its case. The case is VERY bulky to travel with.   I have never written a review on Amazon, but this product is so bad I had to do something!!</li>
            <li> This is a very elegant looking shave, but it doesn&#x27;t excel. I have to shave over and over to get certain spots, and I get shaver burn. It isn&#x27;t awful, but I just don&#x27;t get a great shave with this thing. I&#x27;m going to try something else.</li>
            <li> After much waiting  i ordered Philips Norelco arcitec 1050 wondering whether its worth its price.Its really good. i no longer use blade to do finer shave which i use to do while using ordinary electric shavers.</li>
            <li> First, I just returned a Norelco 1050X ($190) after seeing almost no difference in shave between it and the Remington R-5130.  I&#x27;ve never had the quality problems some mention below with the 5130.  Does the 1050X seem better built?  Only slightly, not an extra $135 though (I&#x27;m not take by the woven carbon fiber look).    I like the way the Remington charges, unlike the Norelco where I need to get the stand out, plug it in then set the shaver in the stand.  And a BIG issue with the Norelco was you can NOT leave it plugged it.  So I guess Norelco expected me to leave work to go home and unplug after an hour or 2 then return to work!      Some folks below complain about the size of the 5130/7130 series.  Personally (here we go again) the Norelco 1050X is too small for a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; sized hand.  The size of the 5130 is just about right.  The Norelco felt like I was holding my toothbrush.    And most imported is the quality of shave, which I am very happy with.  Remington hangs with the Norelco products just at a much lower price.  I&#x27;m 44 and having been shaving for over 2 decades, been through many units.  And, have always returned to Remington as Norelco products never did any better for the extra cash.</li>
            <li> I replaced a Norelco speed razor that was getting old. This 1050 will give a close shave but does not cut longer hair at all.  It takes a long time to get a complete shave.  Sometimes, the highest priced item is not best, and this is the case.  Save your money and get an 8240 Speed.  The new 8240 is very easy to clean.  The 1050 does not allow you to remove the heads, they only flip up.  I like to use oil before I shave and the 8240 allows me to remove the heads, dump them in a container with some rubbing alcohol, and easily clean them with a few shakes.</li>
            <li> Of the \\&quot;three discs\\&quot; type shavers, I think this one is the best because of the way the head articulates. It works well on the chin and neck. However, I assumed that this shaver would get a little closer than it does. I find myself getting a two or three o&#x27;clock shadow every day. In reality, I could probably shave twice a day with it. Immediately after a shave, I can feel a very slight bumpiness from my un cut beard. Once upon a time I had a screen type shaver and it cut much closer. Good product, but don&#x27;t believe the \\&quot;lift and cut\\&quot; rhetoric.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco razors off and on for nearly 40 years.  I&#x27;ve read a few reviews who charge that the quality of this Norelco is not near that of their razors of years gone by.  To some degree, is anything as good as it used to be, I don&#x27;t know?  I do know that materials are lighter and this often is used to explain less quality.  Everyone&#x27;s beard is probably a little different, but I do not find this razor lacking at all in shaving performance, it shaves me closely and without burning.  This is in contrast to the Remington that I just replaced.  I also find this razor to be a lot easier to clean than previous Norelco razors.  I also find the reservoir to be quite adequate in catching the shavings.  Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> The NORELCO Arcitec 1050 provides an excellent shave, cleans easily under running sink faucet. And I&#x27;ve always been impressed with Philips quality. However, traveling with the either of the two, provided, clunky chargers is problematic. The charger takes up a lot of room in my traveling gear. This is compared to my previous NORELCO Shaver with an internal charger. So, I travel with my old NORELCO and use the new Arcitec 1050 at home. Shaving with the Arcitec is comfortable, close and fast. Since I have Irish, red, naturally curly hair on both head and face the close AND comfortable shave is appreciated. Other shavers leave the hair too long and cause ingrown chin and neck hairs, or \\&quot;Shave Bumps\\&quot;. I hope this will help your decision.</li>
            <li> I have owned this razor for about 18 months and it doesn&#x27;t live up to it&#x27;s promise.  It works okay but for the price, I&#x27;d stick with my old Norelco with the half micro-screen style.  I do like that you can rinse this one under water and the battery seems to hold up well.  I actually think I can shave with a normal bic razor &amp; shaving cream just as fast as I can with the arcitec, though and most of the time I need to run one of those over the spots on my neck that the arcitec misses.  Overall, not worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> I am a Norelco shaver user for at least 20 years. I bought this  Arcitec shaver when my old shaver&#x27;s batteries died. and threw it away. I should have spend the money no matter the cost because now every time I shave I get mad. It leaves hair all over my neck and face. The trimmer is a minuscule idiocy with the head in the way. So it is of no help. Today I used the travelling shaver that came  as a bonus with the Arcitec to try to cut the hair on my neck and face that the arcitec always leave untouched. Buy a shaver using razor blades instead of buying this horror dreamed by some retarded \\&quot;designer.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I very much wanted to like this razor.  I&#x27;ve been a long time blad user and was just tired of it.  I bought the Braun series 7, liking the look and reviews of it and found it did a nice job on my face but just couldn&#x27;t do a thing for my neck.  I tried all I could and got nowhere.  So I figured I&#x27;d give the competition a try.  Some things were better and other things worse.    Pros:  -Looks very nice  -Case also serves as a charge  -Very quiet (although perhaps more annoying)  -Cheaper than the Braun  -Is very clean while shaving and easy to clean up    Cons:  -Gives a pretty sucky shave  -Trimmer is tiny    Overall it gave a worse shave than the braun, it did slightly better on the neck but did a worse job on the face.  While it didn&#x27;t cut me it left my skin feeling hot and worn out.  The plus side of it is that it costs about $100 less and looks pretty swanky.    I&#x27;ll be returning this, either to Amazon or to Philips.  And at this point I&#x27;ll just give up on an electric razor.  I either have difficult skin or just expect way too much out of these things.  But the point is, if I have to pull out my blade to take care of my neck, why not just shave my whole face with it?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Norelco rotating blade shavers for almost 2 decades now.  I just bought the Arcitec 1050 at double the money of my previous Norelco that still works, but the battery is holding less of a charge now so I thought more money might be better.      I&#x27;ve had the Arcitec for 2 weeks and it is just average and not worth the money.  Nothing about it is better than my 5 years ago Norelco, last one I bought.  And one thing is definitely worse.  I use the clippers on my old Norelco to trim sideburns, mustache, and ears.  This new thing must have been designed by a woman.  The clipper will protrude very slightly from the body and you cannot use it easily or effectively because the shaving head are in the way.   It is really lame.     I&#x27;m returning it and getting the old style for half the price that I have been very happy with.</li>
            <li> Just not as good I expected/hoped from product description and reviews.  Shave is not very close, no better than my 1999 Panasonic which is still using its original head; trimmer is less than useful; on the plus side, it is very quiet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Norelco razors but this model is terrible. It doesn&#x27;t remove hair from your face no matter how many passes you make. I used an older model Norelco for many years and never had a problem getting a close shave, so I was very disappointed in this \\&quot;higher end\\&quot; model. How can Norelco sell a razor that simply doesn&#x27;t work. On top of this, the chambers don&#x27;t hold hair clippings so they shoot out of the razor and all over the user.  I would advise not to buy this model.</li>
            <li> This razor is fantastic; fast, close comfortable shave.  I will be buying more for Christmas gifts.  Contrary to some reviews, absolutely no razor rash.</li>
            <li> This is a great product but it doesn&#x27;t really work that well for me.  This product is for people with beards that are not thick or coarse. I have a very thick beard and it just doesn&#x27;t get everything. The reason for this is because my facial hair is curly and it tends to \\&quot;lay down\\&quot; as the razor goes over it and not get cut.    I typically will use an electric razor to trim it to short, use this razor to get most of what&#x27;s left and then use a foil head to get it to be even/where I like it.    The razor does do a good job when I&#x27;ve already trimmed my hair but if it&#x27;s more than say... 5 or so days of growth I simply can&#x27;t use it without wasting a ton of time.     I&#x27;d recommend it to people with slow-growing and/or patchy beards.</li>
            <li> This a very poor product.  It does not shave close.  The head lasted about two months and I was told by a Philips agent that the head was not covered by the warranty but I could get a $5 rebate if I bought  a replacement head.  Since I could not shave without a replacement I bought a replacement head.  This one lasted one month before not working.  Also Philips did not honor the rebate.  I have bought a Panasonic shaver which shaves much closrt and has lasted much longer.  Good luck if you buy a Norelco arcitec 1050.</li>
            <li> I received this Norelco as a gift when it first came on the market.  It replaced my older Norelco, which was the 2nd Norelco I owned, so this makes #3.  (#2 was great and nothing wrong with it - it just seemed nice to upgrade to the latest and greatest.) With a very cool design, nice grip and feel, and nice plastic travel case, I really wanted to like it.  Frankly I was pretty convinced by the marketing, which claims that it&#x27;s the closest shave ever, etc etc.  Over several months, as my frustrations grew, I finally realized something:  I was being duped by marketing and that I was in reality getting a terrible shave.    The fact of the matter is that this razor is lousy.  It does three things very poorly.  First, it doesn&#x27;t shave closely OR quickly.  No matter whether I press lightly or strongly, go in circles or in straight lines, it just won&#x27;t cut that close.  And to get it to get as close as I can get, it takes WAY longer than my older Norelco, needing MANY more passes.  Second, it barely traps clippings.  The reason does not appear to be the small clippings chamber; the reason appears to be the design of the new heads.  Third, this thing doesn&#x27;t cut longer hair; that is, it won&#x27;t shave more than a 1-day old shave.  If I skip shaving on the weekend and get to it on Monday, this razor won&#x27;t do the job.  What&#x27;s frustrating is that it&#x27;ll cut maybe 80% of the hair, but then somehow the heads won&#x27;t pick up the remaining hairs, leaving some long hair (amid shaved patches) that I have to get with a blade.  What&#x27;s the point of owning an electric if I need a blade to follow it up?    I know that an electric will never cut as close as a regular blade.  My older Norelco was close, but not quite.  What&#x27;s severely disappointing is that this razor was a HUGE step backward for Norelco - it&#x27;s a more expensive, flashier looking gadget that succeeds in looks/packaging and fails in its main mission: to shave.  Further, Norelco should really be ashamed to be making such astonishingmarketing claims for a product that is so clearly defective in design and such a step backward in product evolution (devolution).      Do yourself a favor: ignore the fancy Norelco marketing and the glitzy packaging, and look at the negative reviews on here.  LOTS of the reviews are by people who have experience with electric razors and have similar sentiments to mine.  It&#x27;s easy to believe the negative reviews because they&#x27;re not just criticisms of obscure details of this razor; rather, they&#x27;re criticisms of the ability of this razor to do its main job.    Buy an older Norelco or buy blades - don&#x27;t buy this thing.</li>
            <li> I have been a longtime user of electric shavers, having settled on Norelco as providing the best for my needs. But along comes this slick new Norelco Arcitec with its sleek looks and amazing seemingly floating shaving heads. It looks like it can just slip-slide across your chin and neck with the greatest of ease. Well, isn&#x27;t it supposed to cut, too? Since I got mine at Xmas, it&#x27;s been trying to equal my last regular electric Norelco (Spectra 8892 XL), but falling way short. I mean, really, it just doesn&#x27;t cut it. I&#x27;ve had to return to my old Norelco for a truly close shave. Come on, Norelco, you used to be a contender! Too much style and no substance! And it&#x27;s hard to clean, too. Is there any way I can return this and get my money back? Please!?</li>
            <li> I replaced a different manufacturer&#x27;s very old electric razor with the Arcitec 1050, and have been using it for about three weeks.  My primary shaving method has been the razor blade, supplemented by the electric for a fast shave now and then.  I am so satisfied with the new Norelco that it has become my primary shaver.  It delivers results virtually as close as a blade, and sometimes I think it is just as good.  I don&#x27;t feel that I need to use a blade to get a close shave any more, and  I&#x27;m really amazed by the results.  I didn&#x27;t think that an electric could ever come this close to a blade.  I guess that the technology has improved over the last twenty years, like everything else!    The shaver is not perfect, but the disadvantages are minor in my opinion.  It does produce hair shavings, so I just shave over the sink.  I don&#x27;t mind cleaning up a little.  The trimmer is quite small, but it does work well enough to clean the sideburns with an up and down motion.  I have found that the shave is quite comfortable if you don&#x27;t overdo it - just shave until you are clean, and use an after-shave cream to avoid minor irritation.  I would prefer being able to leave the plug in the shaver, rather than remove it right after the charge is complete.  It&#x27;s a small inconvenience for such a great shave.  And it is more economical than blades in the long run.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco shavers for many years and was happy with them. This design, however, is poorly developed. The three heads have small individual compartments for cut hair and must be cleaned out daily. It&#x27;s clumsy to open them and the razor is nosier because the heads are above the casing. Also, the charging stand uses up counter space.</li>
            <li> After trying out a Philips (Norelco) 7120 to see if I could escape the wet razor trap I was ready for the next step; that model worked fine, except that by design the battery doesn&#x27;t last that long and I could seldom get an acceptable shave around the neck. The 1050x solves both problems, I can shave in less time (must be the blades it uses) and it charges very quickly (one hour, with a quick charge for emergencies).    It comes with a travel \\&quot;sarcophagus\\&quot; (which I find a nice detail) which can also be used to charge the razor, and a charging stand; the hair deposit chambers for each blade do fill quickly, particularly with anything older than a day old stubble for me, and a sign comes up asking you to empty them - which is done quickly and easily enough.    The only negatives are that it&#x27;s quite a bit noisier than the 7120, but then again that is quite quiet... I still cannot get the best shave over the area between my mouth and my chin... But then again we all different facial features... And it&#x27;s pricey... I&#x27;m still kicking myself for not buying this when it came out as a special deal... But I needed it too much to wait for another one to show up.</li>
            <li> This is a complete waste of money! As others state, it is not able to deal with hairs on the neck, and takes twice as long as the other Philips shavers i used in the past. The chamber has space for one shave only. If you forget to empty after each shave, the contents are nicely distributed over your face and the area below. I wish i had returned it soon after purchase, I shall be throwing mine away now.</li>
            <li> I had a Braun before and I wanted to get the Norelco because I had heard good things about it.    It has a great battery and lasts for a long time without needing a recharge.  There is a low battery indicator and it seems to last a few days even after that light comes on.  It comes with a stand that plugs into the charger so it charges while in the stand which is really convenient.  It also comes with a really nice travel case that also plugs into the charger so you don&#x27;t need to remove it from the case to charge.  I have also used it in the shower and works pretty well in water too.    One minor issue with it is the trimmer on the back for sideburns is not as good as the Braun one but it works well enough for side burns just don&#x27;t try to use it to shave your head or anything.  This is a minor issue and I would recommend this product highly anyways.</li>
            <li> I bought this not knowing what to really expect as this was my first electric shaving machine. Surprisingly, the shave is as good as my regular razor blade. My skin felt really smooth after, plus there were no nicks (the kind you get with regular shaving).     Cleaning the thing is really easy. You just run hot water over the circular blades and air dry.    Battery charging is done in a hour&#x27;s time.    The unit is very light and comes with a stand and a travel case. It is a well-designed product.    If you find this on sale, I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> razor came right on time at a price i couldnt find anywhere and it works like a charm thanks amazon</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco shavers for over 40 years. When my last razor wore out, I decided to go for the highest price model and ordered this model. What a disappointment. I used it for three months and was totally unhappy about how many times I had to go over and over and press HARD to get it to cut. So I bought a new set of blades. Same thing.  So I bought one of the cheaper Norelco Lift And Cut models. Immediately, my shaving time went from seven minutes to 90 seconds. And the shave is much closer - so close my wife noticed it before I could tell her. Sometimes, you can&#x27;t improve on the old reliable. Anyone want a free used Norelco Arcitec???</li>
            <li> Well, I finally bought one. The Philips Norelco Arcitec 1050.  I have been a Braun shaving customer for over 20 years.  I find I&#x27;m able to get almost as close as a blade.  So, why bother with any other shaver?  Well, I&#x27;d always been fascinated by the triple-head design that Norelco pioneered back almost 30 years ago.  The last time I tried one was about 10 years ago, and I wasn&#x27;t impressed.  With the latest Arcitec design, I figured it was time to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Arcitec Models&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;Philips Norelco makes so many different models, I can&#x27;t figure them all out. However, the Arcitec stands out by having a very distinctive slender look, the triple head surface on a flat conical piece that is affixed to a pivot, unlike the \\&quot;neckless\\&quot; other models.  There are 3 main Arcitec models: 1050, 1060, and 1090.  There are also two suffixes: X and CC.  I think the &#x27;X&#x27; means there is no cleaning station, while &#x27;CC&#x27; means a cleaning station IS included.  You may see some models shown without either suffix--this is the same as the &#x27;X&#x27; (before they changed their naming convention).  So, why is there a cleaning station if the heads can be rinsed under water?  Competition.  Braun provides one now... and with the scented alcohol solution, the shaver seems \\&quot;fresher\\&quot; after the cleansing bath.  So, Norelco had to keep up.  But in reality it&#x27;s overkill; don&#x27;t bother with one if you&#x27;re thrifty.  Rinsing the heads under water works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essentially, here&#x27;s the difference:  The 1050 has only 1 indicator for battery recharge needed, the 1060 has several LED indicators showing how much charge is left, and the 1090 has an LED double-digit display showing how many minutes of shaving are left.  Quite frankly, the 1050 is just fine.  When the battery gets low, you&#x27;ve got about 5 minutes left before the shaver will quit.  Even still, for every minute the shaver is plugged in, that is how many minutes of shaving you get.  Plug the shaver back in for 5 minutes, and you&#x27;re ready to go for your shave.  So... although this \\&quot;early warning system\\&quot; looks cool, it&#x27;s overkill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, onto the shaver...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Appearance and Design&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the box, it is a beautiful looking device. Very futuristic. Adorned in several shades of black, dark gray, and silver, with catchy real carbon fiber side panels and a matte rubber finish along the backside for good grip. The three silver shaving discs contrast the black theme nicely. The shaver is lightweight and the heads have a lot of flex to them. The shaver comes with a charging base that serves as a resting stand, which secures the razor magnetically--very tasteful. There is also a \\&quot;travel pod\\&quot; included that allows you to charge the shaver while it is housed inside it. Certainly, the accessories are more impressive than what Braun offers. It looked to me like Braun has met its match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, onto the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shaving Experience&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;This Arcitec 1050 is rather quiet, compared to my Braun 8595 Activator. I watched a couple of YouTube posted reviews of the latest Braun Pulsonic 9595, and that shaver sounded about as loud (if not louder) than my Braun 8595 Activator. So... Norelco certainly wins the prize for most quiet shaver.  Actually, the sound is a low drone... it gives the impression that the shaver is a slow, antiquated device. The Braun sounds Bold and Busy with its Bounding Buzz.  But in reality, the Norelco is formidable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I touch the shaver to my face. I hear and feel the nibble of whiskers taking place. I begin to go through the motions... cheeks, chin, lip areas, then the neck. It feels comfortable. The discs are gentle. I don&#x27;t feel anything like the reports of \\&quot;heavy tugging\\&quot; at the whiskers. I make a full double-pass across my face, then check the smoothness with my free hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eh... not enough. Still rough. No immediate advantage over the Braun.So, I make another few passes. I pinch and pull at my skin as I would with the Braun. I do two more passes and check the smoothness again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eh... not enough. Better, but not as close as the Braun.  I continue... I probably ended up shaving about 2-3 minutes longer than with the Braun. I found that after using the shaver for a couple of weeks and getting used to how it works, I&#x27;m able to match the Braun in closeness.  It just takes a little longer.  But the trimmer on the Arcitec? Awful. There&#x27;s this little ridge on the backside of the shaver. A side switch partially extends and activates it, a small bank of cutting teeth.  It&#x27;s hard to get a nice smooth line. When you encounter a hair with it, there&#x27;s a rather loud \\&quot;click\\&quot; sound. The Braun&#x27;s trimmer is about twice as wide and zaps the hairs effortlessly.  Although the Braun is a louder shaver, the trimmer does not introduce much added noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do notice something else rather positive, though: no whisker dust on my clothes.  The Norelco captures the whisker debris inside the heads and keeps it there, unlike the Braun which will dump a bunch of it on you if you turn it sideways or on a downward angle.  For people who like to shave after they&#x27;ve gotten dressed, that&#x27;s good news for Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parts Replacement&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco recommends replacing the heads every 12 months.  Braun recommends doing so every 18 months.  The Braun Pulsonic series tells you when head replacement is necessary... not sure how this is done (number of shaves?).  The Norelco Arcitec has a little \\&quot;head replacement\\&quot; indicator.  The Norelco replacement heads are about 30% more expensive than Braun&#x27;s Series 5, and 8000 series, although the new \\&quot;cassette\\&quot; system with the Pulsonic is about the same.  So, cost of maintenance might be higher.  Also, I&#x27;ve seen mixed opinions about how long they last.  Some people have complained having to replace them at 6 months, while an acquaintance says he replaces the heads every 10 years--when he changes shavers!  He was once told that the heads are \\&quot;self sharpening\\&quot;.  That sounds a bit unrealistic to me.  In any case, I can&#x27;t report the replacement time here just yet... I&#x27;ll need to use this shaver for a while.  But I&#x27;ll have to give it to Braun for a longer time between head replacement and at a cheaper cost (because it is also said that you can get away with replacing just the cutter block, if the foil is still intact, which drops the cost by 50%... can&#x27;t do this with the Norelco).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;So, the conclusion? The Braun is better overall, but by a slight margin. The Norelco Arcitec 1050 puts up a very good fight. I really could use this razor in place of the Braun, day in and day out. Especially if the girlfriend is still asleep and I want to be super quiet. That&#x27;s what impresses me the most about the Norelco--it is very quiet.  And it is great about trapping the whisker debris (I shave before I get dressed, so it&#x27;s not a critical factor in my case).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which shaver do I prefer?  Well, at the moment it&#x27;s the Braun.  It may be louder, but it has a nice weight to it and is easier to grip.  It also achieves a very close shave in less time than the Norelco.  I&#x27;m planning to keep both... and will alternate between them from time to time.  If I need to shave and make minimal noise, the Norelco will be my choice.  For travel, I prefer the sturdier Braun.  The Norelco looks better on the bathroom counter, no doubt about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the final analysis&lt;br /&gt;---------------------&lt;br /&gt;Appearance:  Norelco&lt;br /&gt;Accessories:  Norelco&lt;br /&gt;Quiet:  Norelco&lt;br /&gt;Cleanliness:  Norelco&lt;br /&gt;Charging:  --tied--&lt;br /&gt;Parts cost:  Braun&lt;br /&gt;Trimming:  Braun&lt;br /&gt;Speed:  Braun&lt;br /&gt;Closest:  --tied--do two more passes and check the smoothness again.

            <li> The Norelco arcitec 1050 is beautiful and flawed. The beauty lays in the eye catching design and craftsmanship found in the shaver, the flaw--unfortunately--is in it&#x27;s primary purpose, which is, as a shaver. As it turns out, I&#x27;ve owned two other Norelcos and a mid-range Braun which have proven to be dependable, well made and produce a good, clean shave. The Norelco arcitec 1050, while doing reasonably well at the job of cleaning the scruff off one&#x27;s mug, seems to require more passes to do the same thing the older models managed with one. The trimmer is also different. The idea is that you must pop off the razor head to get use of it. A novel idea I suppose, but I cannot say that it is any better or worse than the trimmer on my old Norelcos, though it is narrower. Want to buy an Norelco arcitec? Then the 1050 is absolutely the model you should get as the much pricier 1090 is identical in every respect except that the LED array includes a battery charge countdown(which ironically draws power), providing you a ballpark idea of when you&#x27;ll run out of juice. This shaver is still a little expensive (mine happened to be a gift), but it is well made and should provide years of service. I&#x27;ve had mine for over a year and the battery still holds a good charge lasting over a week of daily use. The included travel carrier is useful, though a little tricky to figure out how to use at first.</li>
            <li> This was a christmas gift that I bought for my boyfriend. He is absolutely in love with every feature that this product has. It&#x27;s much smaller and lighter that other electric shavers on the market. That being said it&#x27;s not too small to hold and the 3 shaving heads are the same size as all other razors so it covers the same square footage. The material finishes are extremely high end. It&#x27;s easy to clean and easy top use.</li>
            <li> The good news: Small, light, easy to handle, decent shave, Very easy to clean, cutter life.  The bad news&gt;&gt;It runs off a single 1.3 v AA (penlight) nicad cell [cheap, cheap!), which unlike previous Norelco models, dies very, very young.  It is not replaceable.  This is inexcusable for a $125 razor! I got about 14 months before it stopped and I had to throw it out.  I have never had a battery failure on a razor before!  Other models use multiple cells or larger capacity cells.  It has a microprocessor chip in it (why so complex?!) so don&#x27;t even think about de-soldering the bad battery and replacing it.  It will not run on the AC cord alone.    I replaced the cutter head at 12 months, but found out my old head still cut at about 90% - 95% of the new one, so the cutters are durable.  The bad news is that the razor I bought to replace this one costs a lot less than I paid for the cutting head!  You have to buy one of the two top of the line Norelco models to get the good heads and that is always $100+ for the razor and $40+ for the heads.  After 30 years of Phillips/Norelcos, no more Norelcos for me.</li>
            <li> The grouping of the three blades is to large. The blades need to be smaller in diameter to cover less area on the face. Also, the quality of construction using more plastic indicates that you are forcing your customers to purchase new shaving heads on an annual basis. The shavers you made twenty years ago were of better quality.</li>
            <li> one more perfect shaver from Philips, I like it. Very smooth. One hour recharge and I use it for more than two weeks, shaving once a day. Overall I&#x27;ll recommend to buy it.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in the shaver.  I expected a closer shave.  I have to keep pressing to get a shave.[[ASIN:B001AMRQ2W Philips Norelco Speed 8240 Men&#x27;s Shaving System]]</li>
            <li> I just returned my razor after about 8mo to philips. I never write reviews but felt that this was important for people to know. This razor is not great for someone who shaves rarely,like once a week or who has a thich coarse hair. I never got a great shave and finally complained to customer service who told me that this was probably not the razor for me. They reccomned the traditional style 8260xl that has blades made for more coarse hair. I used this razor last night and it was amazing. I thought others should know.</li>
            <li> I own a 9160xl and was disappointed on its performance so after explaining that to a norelco service rep the only info they had provided was how I can get a closer shave, which i was aware of. My 3yr old norelco i still have to pull out to get a few missed hairs. So anyhow I just bought the new 1050 at wally world and it is quite different. I an not aware of it having different shaving technology in terms of closeness but I will give it a weeks try. The comfort is a totally different feel from the 9160 and feels less \\&quot;Manly\\&quot;. The shaving heads are angled so it takes getting used to. I don&#x27;t see much of a difference now and if not a differnce at all I will try the Braun 360.</li>
            <li> I am a long time Norelco user.  This one looks good but performs bad.  Misses softer hairs and does not shave close.  I had to shave with a blade at least once per week to supplement the Arcitec.  You have to wash it very frequently because the reservoir for stubble is non existent.  I went back to my old Norelco and will be hesitant to buy another.  By the time I contacted Norelco to execute the warranty it was too late (warranty is 3 mo.)</li>
            <li> i bought this shaver for over $100, my 5th Norelco.  I bought it for the \\&quot;space age\\&quot; look.  After using it for a year I bought a $35 Norleco at Walmart and got a better shave.  The Norelco arcitec did not give me a close shave unless I spend many minutes going over and over the same places.  This is the worst of the many Norelco that I have owned.  I looks good but the shave is terrible.  Save your money and buy a Norelco that is less expensive and gives you a better shave.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of the reviews and had some reservations about this product  Turns out that this shaver works great for me and my beard.  My beard &#x3D; med   I almost thought the first shave was too close but now I am getting comfortable shaves.  I own a trimmer set so the small trimmer isn&#x27;t a problem.  http://www.amazon.com/Philips-Norelco-G480-Premium-Grooming/dp/B0016BN4YQ/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_hpc_2  Bottom line is this product works for me and my beard and I&#x27;m getting better shaves.  You be your own judge as everyone beard is different.  I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I have owned an electric shaver.  I researched the field pretty well and read various reviews.  Because I take blood thinners I was suggested that I go from blade shaving to electric shavers.  I am very pleased with the Norelco arcitec shaver. I had no problem with adjustment and had no skin irritation at all.  The shave is almost as close as a blade shave.  The battery has lasted through about six shaves so far and doesn&#x27;t seem to be losing power.  It cleans up easily under the tap.  I&#x27;m very happy I made the decision to go with this product.  UPDATE:  I had to return the product as after about two weeks my skin started to get very irritated, especially if I tried to get a close shave. For people who use electric razors regularly they probably would not have this problem.</li>
            <li> Although it looks sleak, as a razor, this product underperforms. You have to go over areas many times and sometimes, if the facial hair is too long (say, past a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow) the razor won&#x27;t cut it at all. It took me a half an hour to shave with this razor, which is longer than a regular shave. And the final result is a shave that&#x27;s barely what you&#x27;d call \\&quot;close\\&quot; and a few loose long hairs that the razor couldn&#x27;t handle. Whoever made it went more for design than practicality. I ended up switching to a regular old Mach 3 I had lying around. Don&#x27;t make the mistake of buying this razor, you&#x27;ll be very upset with it in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> This review is being written by my Husband.    The Norelco 1050 is my first electric shaver.  I&#x27;ve been using blades since I first started shaving.  I&#x27;m now in my mid 40&#x27;s.  I&#x27;ve now been using this shaver exclusively for the last two weeks.  All-in-all it is pretty good.  Does it give me as close a shave as I got with a blade - no, but it does get pretty close and the advantages I&#x27;m about to tell you about make it worth while.      Over the last few years, I swear my whiskers have felt like they were turning into wire.  With the blade it was taking me about 30 minutes in front of a mirror to shave.  I would pull the skin in all kinds of directions and drag the blade over the skin in all kinds of directions.  I got into the habit of shaving using water alone first, followed by dry, followed by an aloe lotion.  By the time I was done with the blade, I had a super close shave.  However, if I was using a new blade, I would frequently have several deep cuts and nicks.  So, I would shave very carefully until the blade was dull.  A dull blade reduced the amount of deep cuts and nicks (but I would still have some to several) but also increased the time required to shave.  Years ago, it would take about a week for the blade to dull enough but, once dull enough, I could use that blade for a month or more before having to switch blades.  Lately, it would take a few days to dull but would only last a few days.  So, getting cut to ribbons much more frequently is what prompted me to try an electric.      The first few days to week with the electric, I was convinced I would be returning it.  During the second week, my attitude changed.  It still took up to 30 minutes to get a shave I was comfortable with.  I still pull my skin in all kind of directions and run the shaver in all kinds of directions just like I did with the blade.  However, as my face has become accustomed to the electric, the time has come down some to around 20 minutes.  I think it may come down a little more astime goes by.  Parts of my face get a shave as close as I got with the blade, especially the mustache zone, under the lower lip, and my cheeks.  My chin gets close.  My neck and the lower jaw (transition from face to neck) are the worst.  However, they are close to what I would get when using a new blade and had to be very careful to prevent gouging my face.      The pleasant items about using the electric include: I have only gotten two small nicks in two weeks.  I only have to spend a minute in front of the mirror to shave around the sideburns (to prevent shaving too high on the cheek) - the rest of the time I can walk around or watch TV.  Cleanup is a snap - pop open the three chambers and rinse with hot water.  The razor burn I had on my right lower jaw bone (which I didn&#x27;t attribute to razor burn but thought it was a skin condition) is almost gone.      In the first few minutes, the shaver gets the bulk of the whiskers; the remaining time is trying to get a closer shave.  There is a diminishing point of return on time verses close shave which is why I think the shaving time will come down as I decide where that point is.    Since using the electric, my wife said she thinks my face looks better (I think because of the bumps on the right lower jaw bone going away).  She also thinks it feels as smooth as it did with the blade even though I can feel where the whiskers haven&#x27;t been completely eliminated.    So, end result - not a close as a blade but pretty close with some nice benefits that make it worth continuing to use instead of going back to a blade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several Norelco razors over the years, and up till now they&#x27;ve all been pretty good.  This time I figured I&#x27;d go all out and get the expensive model.  The results were poor, it seemed to take forever to shave, and it missed a lot of hairs.  But I stuck with it rather than returning it.  I thought \\&quot;hey, it costs so much, it must be good, maybe I just need to get used to it.\\&quot;  Duh.    Now I&#x27;m stuck with a worthless razor that is not capable of cutting all of the hairs, let along cutting them close.  I have to use the beard trimmer to get the ones that the cutting heads missed, generally on my neck.  What a piece of garbage!  My last Philips/Norelco product ever.    The people that claim it cuts \\&quot;as close as a blade\\&quot; must have peachfuzz on their face.  A grown man with a tough beard will find that this functions better as a paperweight than as a razor.  Zero stars.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco shavers for 20 to 30 years and this is the worst one they ever made. Initially it shaved OK but within 6 months the quality of the shave deteriorated to useless. I contacted customer service and they admitted that they had a problem with the heads. They now include different cleaning instructions (which I did not receive)They would do nothing for me even though they admitted there was a problem with the heads. I am not about to spent [...] on a new head that may only last another 6 months. Sorry Norelco, but you have lost a loyal customer forever.</li>
            <li> First new shaver I had in 10 years.  I had the older version and enjoyed it.    Got this one and the first thing I noticed was that the power cord would not directly fit into the shaver.  You will always need one of the two plastic recharger fixtures to work for you to recharge it.  Both appear to be cheaply made and will warp such that soon I would expect to not be able to use them.  It is good they gave you two.    Second thing I noticed was the angle of incline of the heads.  It is right at a right-angle to vertical.  The early model is near 45 degrees.  This makes you have to hold it very differently.      Third thing I noticed was the sound is a much higher pitch and is simply noisy.      The fourth thing I noticed is that the heads a almost all plastic unlike the earlier version I have.    You change the unit using two metal prongs on each side of the shaver.  I am sure that these will corrode soon as will make additional problems with changing.  Again no plug-in possible to the unit itself.    The last thing I own to say is that the shave itself felt less smooth during shaving.  It felt harsh and rough going over my skin.    So back it goes to get one of the cheaper model (8200 series) instead of their newer design that may look great but fall very short of the other design which now is the 8200 series.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read the negative reviews on this razor, and I was prepared to be \\&quot;let down\\&quot; after getting the razor as a Christmas gift, but let me say that for the first time in a while, Philips-Norelco has come through and hit this one out of the park.  I realize that some folks may have really thick beards and facial hair that makes it difficult for ANY electric shaver to give a very close, comfortable shave with minimal or no irritation.  I understand and respect that.  But for the majority of users with \\&quot;normal\\&quot; facial hair thickness and density, this shaver works and works well.    Negatives:     1.) cleaning it every one or two times due to the reduced \\&quot;waste hair\\&quot; capacity.  However, let me say that it only takes about 30 seconds to rinse it under hot water, and then you are good as new.  I can live with that.    2.)  small beard/sideburn trimmer.  I&#x27;m used to the regular size beard and sideburn trimmers that are common on most Norelco razors; this one is about 1/3 the size.  This is the \\&quot;worst\\&quot; negative for me, but I&#x27;ll live with it, and just use one of my old razors for the trimmer if I have to.    Positives:   1.) less than a one hour charge time.  The POS 7110XL razor that I use gives me maybe 20-25 minutes of shave time, then requires that I charge it for 8 hours.  Great technology there, Philips.  Even some other $100+ Norelcos that I have used take longer to charge than this one.      2.)  the head design and pivot features really work on stubborn neck hair.  This is the primary reason why I love this razor.  After about 6 shaves now, I get a shave as good as a razor and cream, and with less time and mess.  Slap a little Lectric Shave on my face and away the 1050 goes giving me the best, closest shave I have ever gotten with any electric razor (Norelco, Braun, Remington, etc.).  Maybe it&#x27;s just my facial hair \\&quot;type\\&quot;, or maybe using the Lectric Shave helps that much more than the users that put no pre-shave on, but all I can tell you is that I get the results I&#x27;ve desired for a long time--a close shave with NO remaining neck and chin stubble--with NO irritation and spending less time doing it.       In short, this is a great razor, not a perfect one, but a great one that does the job that I&#x27;ve long sought for a Norelco or any electric razor to do.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product.  I bought it for my fiance. It caused many razor burns and made skin breakout.  His skin was irritated for a two days after and did not even get close to a smooth shave. Sorry, but I do not want to spend this kind of money, when he can get a clean smooth shave from a cheap razor. Product returned!</li>
            <li> I wish I had read more reviews (not just online, but also on Amazon) before purchasing this razor.     Like another reviewer mentioned, I wanted to like this razor, but could not. I gave it 21 days and here are my findings.    1) First, I cut myself getting the damn thing out of the plastic packaging, I tried not to let that color my views :)    2) I discover that I can&#x27;t just leave it in the charger, according to the instructions this will damage the device. WTF! Am I supposed to stand around and wait for it to charge, or set a timer or something? This is 2009! Simple electronics could have made it possible to leave the thing in the charger. I would have expected for this price, they would have had the system regulate the charge.    3) When I first used it, the razor was horrible and gave me a huge rash without really shaving very close. OK, they said wait 21 days. The problem is, after about four days, even though the rash was abating somewhat (helped by some Mennen Afta Pre-Electric Shave) I had these hairs it would not cut. As it kept missing them, they got longer and would not get cut at all. I ended up using tweezers (I know, I know) to get them out.      After about four weeks now, the rash is better and my face is adjusting. The shave overall is ok, but not very close. To get a closeish shave I have to press harder and go over spots twice and stretch the skin. I spent hours online thinking maybe it was me and researching technique etc, but have come to the conclusion the razor is at fault.    4) The trimmer is nice to have, and works OK and is better than nothing.    The upshot is that it takes me just as long, if not longer to shave with this razor as a wet shave would take. The result is not very good, even on a good day I have a shadow, my face feels rough and after shaving it is a little sore.      If you buy this razor (which I don&#x27;t recommend) you will find it gets better over the 21 days, but in the end it still does not perform as expected.     [...]So, basically I would say do not buy this razor, you can get a much better one for $ less than this one. Also, there seems to be some conspiracy theory on Amazon as to whether Philips or competitors are writing the reviews. Well, I am neither and would even suggest you buy a different Norelco product, just avoid this one. Also, there are plenty of reviews not on Amazon, for example Gizmodo has a review:    [...]    As for the money back guarantee, well you have to buy a razor, get face burn for 21 days before you can be sure you hate it, then you&#x27;ll probably have to divulge a lot of personal info to Philips and pay shipping etc. Just don&#x27;t bother getting this razor in the first place. Of course everyone has a different face/beard and I would perhaps have put it down to that had I not found so many others with similar experiences to mine.    As a final note, I think the reason this razor does not work very well may have a lot to do with the mounting of the heads. The springs under each shave head are quite stiff, and the design means that the heads rarely sit flush against the face. You can fix this by pressing down, but that irritates the skin and is hard to do on a soft area like the neck. The razor also has trouble around the corners of my mouth and under my nose area, probably for the same reasons. It seems like the when you shave, only part of the heads are contacting the skin at any given time. The instructions say to go in circles against the grain, but it works better if you just go against the grain in strokes.</li>
            <li> I have been a Norelco user ever since I started shaving mostley a blade man but used when I did feel like useing the blade on my upper lip , I have only used a couple of times but I think it&#x27;s the best shaver I have ever had, I  would recommend it highley.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco rotary razors for 30+ years, except for a couple of brief stints with competing brands.  I have always returned to the Norelco.  I got my Arcitec 1050 for Christmas in 2008, so have been using it almost a year.  It is a great razor, the best Norelco ever.    The true test of a razor is how well it shaves, and the biggest challenge to me is in the neck area.  With my old Norelco rotary, I had to really work to make sure my neck got shaved and sometimes had to touch up with a regular blade.  The Arcitec does a great job of shaving, the best ever by a Norelco shaver.    Some reviewers complain about the position of the trimmer.  It did take  little getting used to for me, but it is no big deal.  The trimmer itself works much better than those on previous Norelcos.    I highly recommend the Norelco Arcitec.</li>
            <li> This thing is a piece of crap. I have 3 other razors that are about 1/8 the price of this one, like the cheap-o ones you get at walgreens and they all out do this waste of space. I have to go over the same area up to a dozen times to get some of the hair sometimes. It is by far the worst shaver I have ever used. It is comfortable but it does not shave for crap</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Arcitec 1050 for about 3 months and like it with a few caveats.  The shave is a good, close shave. Most days I shave as soon as I stumble out of bed at 4:30AM, without so much as washing my face.  The shave is good, stubble starts to show by late afternoon.  The days I shower first, 12 hours later it is like I just shaved. I am getting 25 shaves per recharge, better than advertised.    As stated by Norelco, it took several weeks for the razor to be really comfortable.  May not have helped that those first few weeks were very cold and dry.  I have used a Norelco for 15 years, didn&#x27;t expect to need the 3 week break in, but I did.       I am not thrilled that the razor has to be washed daily, but it is easy to do.  However, it means the razor sits open drying most of the time which is no real problem, but annoys me.  On the plus side, after 2 months I poured a little isopropanol in the cup I got with Norelco cleaner fluid 15 years ago, stuck the razor head in it and ran the 1050 for 30 seconds.  Much easier than having the take all the heads out and swish them one at a time as with my old 7825.  The shave improved too, so periodic thorough cleaning is (as with all Norelcos) a must.    The trimmer is fair.  It&#x27;s fine for sideburns, terrible for my mustache.  I bought a mustache trimmer, which works much much better than any razor&#x27;s trimmer.  So maybe that the poor 1050 performance was a good thing.    My one big concern.  The first 1050 I bought died after 18 shaves.  Just would not turn on.  Would not charge.  I returned it to the store and exchanged it, and the second 1050 has had no problems.  But there are more electronics in the Arcitec than in my car.  I suspect that caused the failure.  So I am concerned about the robustness of the design.  Although electronics tend to die early, or last a long time.      Oh, and the shape is the easiest I&#x27;ve ever handled.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used an electric shaver. So when my last one needed replacing, I decided to get a really good one. Boy, did I make the wrong choice. It gives a barely acceptable shave if you shave every day. If you skip a day, forget it! It will take forever to shave. And forget doing your neck, it just won&#x27;t take off the hair. The little half inch wide trimmer is a joke. And make sure you shave BEFORE you put on a shirt, because you&#x27;ll be wearing all the hair it doesn&#x27;t seem to hold in.  Rotten product, can&#x27;t believe I fell for the hype, and can&#x27;t believe I have to buy a new shaver.</li>
            <li> I have used alot of shavers. This shaver gives me the best shave for an electric shaver I have ever used. Cleaning is easy. Being able to clean with water without taking apart is a real plus. It seemed expensive but it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently moved from my trusty Gillette Fusion Power over to this electric and I have been pleasantly surprised. After trying the Braun Pulsonic and finding it a bit rough on my face the Arcitec worked much better (your face may react differently but my chubby mug didn&#x27;t like the Pulsonic).    I have a THICK scruff each morning and the Arcitec ate right through it. It took about a week for the shaver to break-in enough that it got everything on a first or second pass so that was a bit irritating but livable.    The trimmer really needs work and practice and that&#x27;s my only major complaint.</li>
            <li> This is Norelco&#x27;s newest model men&#x27;s shaver.  This shaver affords men the closest and light weight shaver that I have ever used.  You end up with a clean but comfortable shave every time.</li>
            <li> Oh, C&#x27;mon guys! There is no way this is a one or two star product. Is it perfect? Hardly, but it&#x27;s worth at least four stars. I first heeded these negative warnings and went with another product (to remain unnamed) and was majorly disappointed. The shave was so bad, my co-workers thought I had the mange. So I reluctantly bought the 1050, figuring if Norelco&#x27;s top of the line doesn&#x27;t cut it, I&#x27;ll just quite my job and join ZZ Top.    To clarify, my beard is category: WOLFMAN. I have coarse, wiry whiskers, and plenty of them... and they grow fast. Needless to say, I need an industrial strength razor. I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers for over 25 years, and while this one isn&#x27;t the best I&#x27;ve owned, it is close. In fact, the more I get used to the design features, it may eventually take the top spot. The shave is quick, smooth and close, and the unique head design allows for some serious precision manscaping (if you&#x27;re into that sort of thing!)     Complaints: Like most modern rechargeable razors, it&#x27;s slightly underpowered compared to it&#x27;s plug in ancestors. Also, the whisker chamber is too small. I have to empty it at least once during a shave. If I didn&#x27;t wear a vandyke, I&#x27;d probably have to empty it twice.    Prognosis: A good razor, a good shave. I&#x27;m keeping my day job (much to the relief of ZZ Top fans everywhere).</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift  for my husband. It is the worst razor he has ever owned. I wound up getting replacement parts for his old Braun razor.  no comparison as to the closeness in shave with no burning.</li>
            <li> This new razor gives me the best shaves I have ever had.  The ease of keeping it maintanied makes it a super value.</li>
            <li> When I first saw the commercial for the arcitect, I was intrigued. Well I got a Panasonic Nano for the Christmas holiday. It was decent but left too many hairs, not smooth and was hot to the touch. So I made a return for the arcitec and what a major change!!! The shaver is very smooth and glides over my face. Very very close shave on the face and chin!!! I have never had a shaver get total clean on the neck, but this razor did much better than any other I ever had....and I have had many. The shaver stays nice and cool to the touch. Cleanup is so easy!!! Just pop open, run under water and done in 15-20sec tops.  The shaver is quiet as well. All around winner!!!    I stronlgy recommend the aritec!!! You won&#x27;t be sorry!!!</li>
            <li> I own this shaver for over a year now. I already own an old Norelco (http://www.amazon.com/Norelco-Deluxe-Reflex-Plus-Shaver/dp/B00009RB11). I find myself using the old shaver instead of this model. I like to shave my head bald. This model leaves some hair. I have to use the 6863 xl model to finish the job. Then I feel my head very smooth, with almost no hair missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like to shave bald, I strongly recommend the 6863 XC model. But Don&#x27;t leave it plugged in for too long. It will reduce the battery life.</li>
            <li> I got it for my boyfriend after reading through all reviews. Great design, but not too close-cut he said. and you have to open each three top cover and clean them every time.</li>
            <li> Not one for close shaves, I needed a new shaver and fell into the Consumer Report thing of buying the highest rated shaver:  Braun 8985.  It was so heavy, it felt like pushing a lawn mower across my face!  Then I got the Norelco arcitec 1050. What a beauty.  It was love at first shave!  On the first shave, I was getting the shave I wanted; did not have to wait the 2-3 weeks for my face to get used to the new shaver, as warned by the manufacturer.  I love the way the head glides.  Plus,so light and so ergonomically perfect in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why didn&#x27;t I give it 5 stars:  Assuming that one carries the shaver in the power pod when traveling (its like a travel case), its disappointing that there is no room for the power cord in that pod. Also, while in the pod, you cannot place the head cap.  The natural question then is, what kind of architects designed this arcitec?!</li>
            <li> The arcitec shaver is the least of three Norelco shavers that I use. The arcitec heads need to be closer toghter. The trimer needs to be longer and wider. It would be great with these adjustments.</li>
            <li> The norelco arcitec 1050 works great and does what it is supposed to do which is give a nice close shave. The docking station works well and it charges pretty fast and also holds it&#x27;s charge for quite some time. The only draw back about this shaver is it can be a little tedious to clean because each head opens separately but other than that this shaver is a great product.</li>
            <li> I just used the arcitec  1050 great shave. Great shaver very light super space age design very easy to use. Finally a new design I have been shaving with norelco for 25 years my last was a spectra good shaver but always missed my neck this did not. Bravo. Do not listen to the whiners on here maybe thery have a beard like the wolfman if you beard is like that get a straight razor and some foam. I have a pretty med beard and it works great. To bad about the power chord but everything changes after a while Bravo again norelco, just a tip you dont need three models 1050/1090 would be fine.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking this work well, this was the second electric shaver I am using and I thought my beard was not very tough, especially with the razors and cream. However, I guess it is tough, as this shaver took forever to shave the easiest shaves. My neck would always have left over hair, which would mean that I would have to shave the way I normally did earlier with my razor and cream, so it does not make sense at all for me at least to buy this product and sadly, it does not work for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased mine about 5 weeks ago.  It&#x27;s great!  Prior to buying, I read many many of the reviews and as a result was quite skeptical and leary about trying one.  Since I new I could return it if not satisfied, I decided to give it a try.  It&#x27;s a fine piece of work.  Clean, relatively quick saves; gets the long wiskers too; smooth face;  no razor burn; long lasting (long!) between charges;  the trimmer works very well;  no fuss to clean, just open the three heads over the sink, they hold the shaved wiskers very satisfactorally until dumped (mini-minimal drops to the floor or my chest;  no need to rinse but probably smarter to do in the long run;  very pleased with it.  Don&#x27;t worry, try it for yourself.  Push out, mon, and circle in the lift of life.                     Jaun Armostrongalis, Montpelier , Vt.</li>
            <li> Norelco/Phillips Model 1050 Shaver is an outstanding product!   Consistently performs a perfect shave with fantastic speed and ease of operation. Cleaning is simplicity itself.  Best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used! I recommend it without reservation!</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco shavers exclusively ever since I started shaving, 7 years ago.  The arcitec is much superior to the low-range model that I used before.  I shave every 2 days so this shaver is perfect for my stubble (I find daily shaving to be irritable).  The trimmer is very precise but is very limited in its usefulness.  Instead, I bought a Norelco trimmer, which has an adjustable head (no attachments!!).  I use my dedicated trimmer for trimming the facial hair that I keep and also for shaping my beard.      The arcitec is a shaver, not a trimmer; I am not lowering my rating of the arcitec based on its small precision trimmer.  I also don&#x27;t use toothbrushes to clean floors because excellent results are only achieved through using the proper tools.  If you need a trimmer larger than the arcitec&#x27;s precision trimmer, then buy a trimmer.    To summarize, I feel this is the best electric shaver available.</li>
            <li> I am a long time Norelco user and this as the most disappointing razor I purchased.  It was going back 10 years as far as shaving is concerned.  Does not shave well is the bottom line.  Takes 3X longer to shave then its predecessor.</li>
            <li> I have used this for two weeks and am very pleased with the shaver.  I have used Norelco shavers for 30 years and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I am a woman with facial hair. I have used mostly electric razors of many kinds to avoid the nicks I sometimes got with non-electric shavers. I bought the Arcitec about 2 years ago,and it DID give me the closest shave I ever got from an electric,with less irritation.SOOOO smooth and comfortable. I just cleaned my face with a cotton ball or two and witch hazel,and that was enough to prepare my skin for shaving. The shape made it very comfortable to hold,and gave excellent control. It was very well made,and looked it. I traveled on airlines with it twice,using the included hard travel case/recharger,and it came through it perfectly. I only shave 3 times a week,so the blades lasted over a year.And since it was the most expensive razor I ever bought,I read and followed the owner&#x27;s manual very closely and took very good care of it.  Suddenly,though,the battery wouldn&#x27;t stay charged. I had to fully charge it to use it,and if I left the Arcitec off the charger,the battery drained itself dead. I had lost the receipt. I went on the company website and did the online chat with a service representative. The representative was very polite and helpful,and I explained the problem,and admitted to having lost the receipt,and he STILL said that they&#x27;re replace it right away,if I would agree to send the broken one to them promptly,postage prepaid by THEM. The new razor arrived in a sealed new package,like they have at the store,and they also sent a postage paid label,and instructions to send the old razor and all accessories and a copy of the invoice in the box the new one came in,and I could then just put it in any UPS drop box to mail it.  I would buy Norelco again,ANYTIME!</li>
            <li> I owned a Philips Norelco shaver that cost much more than this model (purchased Dec 2008).  However, even at more than twice the price the I found the quality of the shaver to not meet my expectations. After a year of usage my shaver would stop intermittently while I was shaving. After a couple weeks the shaver would not turn on at all. The shaver was replaced under warranty.    Walk the calendar forward to Nov 2010 and I am experiencing exactly the same problem, shaver stops intermittently while I&#x27;m shaving (even though it&#x27;s fully charged). Knowing what&#x27;s about to occur AGAIN I call Philips/Norelco customer care, the shaver has a 2 year warranty, but not really. While P/N warranties the shaver for 2 years, they only cover replacement ONCE. Even though I&#x27;m still within my 2 year warranty, the unit is no longer covered.    Now maybe I&#x27;m just one unlucky guy, getting two shavers that have exactly the same problems and almost within the same time frame (1 year), but this seems to indicate a design flaw in this particular model. The fact that P/N warranty terminates after the initial unit is replaced is not making me a happy P/N customer. I then looked for another shaver, this time it was NOT a P/N model and I would suggest that you consider other brands as well or be well aware that 2 years doesn&#x27;t mean 2 years to Norelco.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Philips shavers for probably over 15 years, I fell in love with them from the start.... I got myself used to shaving while I was on the phone, walking around the house, running up the stairs, in the shower and sometimes when I&#x27;m driving.&lt;br /&gt;I always dry shave, I don&#x27;t put anything on my face and even after a few days of not shaving I can still use my Philips shaver and not feel the slightest pinch :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly this all changed when I decided to fork out the money on a name I trusted for so long....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly yes this shaver looks awesome, after you hold it you can tell right away its a lot lighter and fits much better in your hands that the other Philips shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bads:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Unlike other Philips shavers you can not plug this shaver into your outlet, you have to place it in the carrying pod or shavers stand, this is a inconvenience to me, I am pretty sure its a matter of time before I drop this carrying pod and break it, or worse spill water on it by mistake and damage it ( the charger is not water proof).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) No Sensitivity Adjustments on the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Finally this is a Terrible shaver, the worst Philips I bought, I honestly don&#x27;t feel that I should compare it to other models... I have to go over each area over and over and over and over literally and still not get a good shave, so much for cutting shaving time by half :-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have another Philips who&#x27;s blades haven&#x27;t been changed in over 1 year and yes it shaves better than this brand new Arcitec! I am not kidding!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So who should buy this? Well if you have a lot of money to throw around and want to give your teen son who barely has any facial hair a really cool looking gadget to show off to his friends then this might be a good way to throw your money down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final note the Arcitec is great bathroom decoration and is better suited in the Sharper Image catalog than as a Philips Norelco product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S Sharper Image is now bankrupt, you catch my drift?</li>
            <li> This is my third Norelco shaver. While I&#x27;ve always gotten better shaves with foil shavers, they are really noisy and I&#x27;ve even cut myself with them.    My first Norelco did not have the newer heads that conform to your face, and while I got a good shave, it wasn&#x27;t great.  My next Norelco had floating heads that did a much better job.  I also decided to shave my head, and the Norelco did a good job of conforming to my head. When that razor needed new blades I decided to splurge and get this one, since a set of heads would cost as much as a new razor.    This model looks like something from outer space and conforms well to my neck and any indented spaces.  It does not conform that well to my head, but the first time I used it I could feel and hear it cutting better than any of the other Norelco&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used.  It also gives a closer shave than the others, but not as good as a foil shaver or a blade.    It is much easier to clean than the others, as each blade opens individually and you can really get in there with the faucet. They also recommend running the razor in a sink filled with soapy water.  Since one of the hardest things to do with a Norelco is clean it, this is a huge improvement over earlier models.    If it just shaved a little closer, and conformed a bit better to my head, it would have earned an easy 5 stars.    BTW, if you&#x27;ve never used an electric or a rotary razor before, you have to give it a chance. It comes with a satisfaction warranty, but give it the full test before you write it off.    It also comes with a great travel/charge \\&quot;pod\\&quot; that should protect the razor from everything short of a nuclear blast.</li>
            <li> Good product.  I have used Norelco razors for 40 years and this is the best.</li>
            <li> This razor is a work of art -- exceptional styling and quality of fit and finish as far as I am concerned. In addition, it shaves quickly and closely with minimal irritation. I also own a new generation CoolSkin 8040X which I use exclusively in the shower with Nivea for Men shaving gel, and it provides an exceptionally close shave with no irritation for my skin/beard type. I received the Arcitec 1050X Christmas Eve, have used several times already both \\&quot;dry\\&quot; (with a Pre-electric shave lotion) and \\&quot;wet\\&quot; over the sink with lotion and a few drops of water patted on my face, and it shaves very well either way. I would give the slight edge to the 8040X in terms of closeness and comfort, but I love both, and if you prefer shaving dry, the Arcitec 1050X is an excellent choice. And did I mention that it is a work of art? Beautiful and functional!    Update (1/16/08): This razor really holds its charge well. I am still using the original (initial) charge, and although I don&#x27;t use this razor to shave everyday, I originally charged it Christmas Eve. Additionally, after seeing several reviews claiming that this razor was only good for shaving everday, and could not handle 2-3 day growth, I recently shaved after allowing my beard to grow for three full days just to test how the razor would handle it. Admittedly, I don&#x27;t have the heaviest beard growth, but it&#x27;s not \\&quot;light\\&quot; either so I can grow a full beard with good coverage. This razor handled my 3-day growth pretty well. Of course, it did take me longer to shave than it normally does if I shave everyday, but I was very pleased with the results. I did not find that the razor bogged down, nor did it pull or snag on any hairs as some claimed it would. The power/rpms were plenty enough to tackle this job with relative ease and I am still very happy with this razor and can highly recommend giving it a try. Remember that if you are really dissatisfied, you can return it to Norelco within 60 days and receive a refund. I returned a previous model that did not work well for me and received my refund check within a month. Good luck, and hope it works for you!</li>
            <li> The Norelco Architect lives up to the hype.  It gives a close shave quickly and comfortably and is easy to clean.  Best of all, the price  with the super saver shipping, beat all others I researched.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Philips shavers for 20 years and now this machine show me that I should change my old Philips before.</li>
            <li> Very nice shaver, Easy to clean and gives a great shave.         [[ASIN:B000PKNPES Philips Norelco arcitec 1050 Men&#x27;s Shaver]]eat shave.</li>
            <li> Great product! Very efficient shave. Easy to clean. Holds its charge for a long time. The trimmer isn&#x27;t much, buy that seperate.</li>
            <li> I am quite satisfied with my purchase of this product.  It arrived promptly after I placed the order,  It has a good, comfortable feel when in use and gives me a good shave.  It&#x27;s easy to clean.  It charges fully in an hour, and the charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I ordered this weeks ago and still don&#x27;t have it so still waiting will write more when get it</li>
            <li> I received this shaver as a birthday gift almost three years ago, and since then I have never looked back at Gillette products. As long as you use it every day (and won&#x27;t your beard grow too long) you will think of shaving as... just another thing to do in the morning instead of \\&quot;O my God, I still have to shave\\&quot;.  It doesn&#x27;t require cream, or water, so you can even shave on a couch while watching morning news. On few occasions I even did it while driving a car. The head remains sharp forever, and battery lasts a lifetime (I charge it 2x month max). There are newer models of this shaver, and you should probably go with them, as I predict that they can only be better. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Cannot understand why this type of razor wasn&#x27;t invented many years ago.  Seems like something that should&#x27;ve been available in the 90&#x27;s.  Great to finally shave with electric and no longer feel roughness under chin on the front of my throat!  Feel I should be re-imbursed for the other Norelco&#x27;s I bought throughout my life.  Good job!  Do I win anything?  Truly,  Jim Haugh</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor instantly after a try out. It appears to me that most reviewers do not take into account that when it comes to (high end) electric razors, the question as to whether a machine is \\&quot;good\\&quot; or \\&quot;bad\\&quot; does mostly depend on one&#x27;s own biological physiognomy, and not on the particularities of the brand. For decades, I wet shaved with the most expensive (and best) Gillette blades, because every episode with a Braun shaver resulted within a short period in serious skin irritation. A recent try with a high end Panasonic wet shaving model was also not very successful. That does not mean that the Braun or Panasonic models are bad, their technology does just not adapt to my skin and my hair. The problem was always, that a significant amount of my hairs was either to curly or to soft to be cut efficiently by the vibrating blade of those modells. As a consequence, the shaving required more mechanical pressure and an increased number of strokes, resulting apparently also in increased micro skin injuries, followed by typical skin burn or even rash over time. The Phillips machine uses rotating blades, at comparably low speed, and for whatever reason, the blade rotation technology (which is in existence for at least 50 years or so) cuts my hair much more efficiently than a horizontally vibrating blade bar. No burn at all. The shaving result itself is not quite as smooth as with a 5 blade Gillete, but it comes close. The nice thing is that after a while, the face of the skin developes a specific soft touch, which does not develop with wet shaving. So try it out, if you can. Cleaning of the machine is easy and very efficient, you just open the blade covers and hold them under running water. One final comment: According to the imprint on the razor, the machine is \\&quot;Made in the Netherlands\\&quot; - Hold on to your hat, if that is true: A quality consumer article made in a country where people get real wages paid and have social security and health care. Its possible!</li>
            <li> I read all the bad reviews, then read the good ones and bought it.  I have a light beard, and use a pre shave lotion, and this razor makes face feel like a baby&#x27;s butt.  I have only had it two days and they say it takes up to two weeks before you get that perfect shave.. I got the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Excellent.     This was a gift for my husband.  He has used Norelco electric razors before.  Always pleased.  However, this one is easier to clean and use and he finds that it gives him a truly close shave.</li>
            <li> I am a Norelco man.  This razor is nice.  It is built solid, has an amazing battery life, and shaves pretty good.  I only recharge it about once a month.  It does take slightly a few more passes when shaving than my older Nivea Norelco, but it is not a deal breaker.  It does clean the neck very well, plus the trimmer is a lot better than other Norelcos I have tried out.  It looks sleek and has a nice stand.  I don&#x27;t work for Norelco, just want to stand up for Norelco since I feel it is a good product.  What are people with negative reviews doing wrong with this razor?  I have had it for over two years with no complaints.</li>
            <li> I really like the look of this shaver and I was hoping it would be as good as the commercials touted it to be. Alas, this was not the case. Sure, it gives a close shave, but I have to go over and over and over the same spot to get it. And there are still hairs on my neck that it just can&#x27;t cut. I&#x27;ve had the 1050 for about 3 months now. Just over 3 years before I was given a [[ASIN:B001AMRQ2W Norelco SpeedXL]] and loved it. It cut quickly and did a good job. Unfortunately it wore out and the only one of the blades still cuts. So I got this new razor hoping that it would be even better than the XL. It does contour to the face really well, but it just doesn&#x27;t cut my stubble easily. More than a day or two and it has a VERY hard time. And forget the tiny trimmer, it is just too hard to use. I go back to the one on the XL if I want to trim my sideburns or nose hairs. The 1050 holds a charge for a while and does clean fairly easily but you have to do it after every one or two shaves or it gets harder to get a good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like rotary shavers and have used them most of my adult life, but this one is a let-down, especially for the $130+ price. I would seriously consider trying a Phillips or Braun foil razor the next time around, given the reviews I&#x27;ve read. On a final note, the stand is a bit flimsy and tips easily, and the plug is a bit large, but those are minor considerations. If you want a good, close shave that doesn&#x27;t irritate, I wouldn&#x27;t make this the first on your list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: This razor has gone from bad to worse. It sometimes takes up to 10 minutes to finish a shave. The blades aren&#x27;t dull since there is no pulling, but it just doesn&#x27;t want to cut. I clean and maintain it meticulously so that is not the issue. This is a good looking razor, but that is about it. I cannot recommend it to anyone at this point. I just dropped a star from my previous 3 and still feel like I&#x27;m being generous.</li>
            <li> This is the second Arcitec that I have purchased.  I travel frequently for work, and got tired of having to remember to toss it in my travel bag every time I go out of town.  Best Norelco razor that I have owned, and I have been using electric razors since I started shaving.  Extremely close shave, very easy to use, and a breeze to clean.  If you have never used an electric, try this one, and you will be surprised.</li>
            <li> This shaver was very disappointing. I was excited the first time I used it but after a couple of days the blades seemed to get dull. It would pick and pull on my beard. It would leave random hair on my face and attempts to angle the shaver were not successful. I rarely leave feedback, but this shaver is so bad I felt I had to. My face was raw for two days after I quit using it. I am back to my trusty disposable minus $100 plus.</li>
            <li> This razor is not the best, as so indicated by a variety of consumer reports.  The swivel head literally makes it more difficult to shave in the neck area and along the jaw line.  I find myself going over and over areas to the point of frustration, all the while not cutting hairs.  Expect a pimply rash at times as well, of which was never typical of my skin.  Not worth the money for a razor with cutting issues.  I&#x27;m looking to return mine for something that works.</li>
            <li> It simply did not shave well. I took me at least 3 times as long to get a mediocre shave verses my 4 year old shaver. I went for the norelco 8200 series that was more like my old shaver in structure and it works great.</li>
            <li> Prior to purchasing this electric shaver I was a Gilette Mach3 man.  I have been using those razors for the past 10 years and have had pretty good results.  The reason for looking elsewhere was the increasing frequency of red bumps along my neck.  After purchasing this product most of the red bumps have disappeared.  I just purchased some electric shave liquid you brush on your skin prior to shaving and this is supposed to reduce the bumps even further.      I rate this product a 8 out of 10.  The shaver is a good value and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been hearing lots of really good things about this new razor Norelco has advertised. It looks good but so far I have noticed very little action. The best part  is that the razor head angles, the worst part is the trimmer. It&#x27;s awful. What ever happened to the older heavier models with a great trimmer and  heads that delivered a great shave and the motors were powerful? I guess those days are gone forever.    I WOULDN&#x27;T RECOMMEND THIS RAZOR, IT&#x27;S ALL HYPE!</li>
            <li> My husband has used electric razors for many years and says this Philips norelco is absolutely the best he has encountered.  The ARCITEC gives the closest shaves and is easier to clean than others.  He would definitely recommend it to other men.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, and with a stylish design what&#x27;s not to love!  There is one minor flaw... It does take a little while to get the longer hairs, and if you go over your face more then 3-4 times it starts giving razor burn!  Other then that I love this razor!</li>
            <li> I am 59 years old, I have used norelco electric razors for at least 35 years maybe longer. This arcitec is the most expensive and the most worthless piece of crap I have ever bought. It doesn&#x27;t deserve to carry the norelco label. They must of forgot to try this one out before putting it on the store shelf . All I can say is SHAME ON NORELCO, I will never buy another norelco product, because I am might be taken to the cleaners again.....</li>
            <li> I purchased this razer approx. 2 weeks ago and I must say this is the finest shaver I have used to date.  I am without a doubt loyal to the norelco product but there have been other shavers which have cut closer and more comfortable to use until now.  The Arcitec 1050 is comfortable, butter smooth, and cuts as close as a blade.  I have very senitive skin and I could never shave more than once every 2 days without razer burn.  I now shave every day and no irritation what so ever.  I highly reccomend this product even though it is a little pricey it is worth every penny spent.  The trimmer works best when you remove the shaving head which merely pops on and off with ease.</li>
            <li> I am baffled by these poor reviews, I used a norelco before with the three heads, but this one is markedly BETTER!, the first shave I got using it was incredibly close and clean, it seemed effortless, no doubt the three blades cutting on each head give a much better shave, how anyone could say otherwise is beyond me, well, to each his own I guess, what kind of mugs do you mugs have anyway?, maybe you oughta try some sandpaper!, I just tried a panasonic linear type wet/dry razor which was very loud and took forever to shave, and then not cleanly, I returned it, and now can&#x27;t believe this norelco can be beat.</li>
            <li> I got my 1050 Artic shaver for Christmas. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week. I realy like it. It shaves faster, better and it gets into the hard to get places much easer. I read several reviews after it was orded some good and some bad so I wasn&#x27;t shure about it. But after 1 week I am very happy with it.                           A Satisfied Customer</li>
            <li> It leaves the worst patches of hair. I use a disposable to clean up after everytime I use the arcitec. I have tried trimming with short hair and long hair neither work well. Overall this is worse then my pervious phillips and I will never buy a phillips electric again!</li>
            <li> While it does give a closer shave than my old Norelco, the battery must&lt;br /&gt;be charged every 4 or 5 days, not the 26 it claims.</li>
            <li> The Norelco Electric Razor (Arcitec 1050) is a beauty.  It does everything it says.  I would recommend it to anyone!  If you want a close shave, this is it!   Jim MacDouagll</li>
            <li> This is the first time i&#x27;m actually using an electric razor and I did review a lot before buying the Norelco 1050. Its quiet, lasts as long as specified and gives a pretty good shave to the face.     CONS: The shave to the neck is not that good and since I like to have a real clean shave I end up using my razor once in a while to finish the job!    Overall a decent product. ( I have used the shave for more than 20 days so this isnt a biased review )</li>
            <li> I have been a Norelco user for over 20 years. Over that time, there have been some models that have worked and others that haven&#x27;t. This one doesn&#x27;t.  I really wanted to like this shaver. It looks so good and is advertised as their newest and best, but sadly, it&#x27;s not a shaver worth keeping. It looks great, feels good in your hand and is pleasantly quiet, but that&#x27;s it.   It doesn&#x27;t shave that well and in fact misses more hair that it should around the neck. The floating moving heads are too soft to allow pressure to be placed under the neck where it&#x27;s needed and I often felt that I was going to break it as I pushed it under and around my neck to try (without much success) and cut the hairs under and to the sides of my neck.   I have tried the Brauns and other electric shavers over the years to look for that next and best shaver.. I always end up back with Norelco, and sadly, this one was not a keeper for me.   The floating head design (which attracted me to the shaver) was the thing that made it a poor shaver and despite wanting to like it, I returned it...</li>
            <li> this is a much better shaver than there earlier model i bought a few years ago.  it has a cool feature how each head moves on its own to try and fit your face as you shave.  only negative comment i have is the absurdly high price - i think it should really be around 100 dollars.</li>
            <li> I am a lifelong Norelco user. as a matter of fact, I&#x27;ve never owned anything but a Norelco shaver. I bought the Arcitec 1050 when I broke my current shaver. It is not only the worst shaver I ever tried, It&#x27;s the first bad Norelco I&#x27;ve ever tried    It doesnt give a close shaver, even though I spent twice as much time shaving. It leaks chopped whiskers all over the place. The pop up trimmer cant be used without catching your hair in the shaver (that is if you&#x27;re lucky enough to have hair!). it doesnt reach the top of ny moustache/bottom of my nose. It does a lousy job on my neck.    I&#x27;m returning it to norelco and buying another more standard model!  I never write reviews, but I felt VERY strongly about warning fellow loyal Norelco customers!</li>
            <li> Philips should be ashamed of themselves. This \\&quot;shaver\\&quot; is neither use nor ornament! I tried, for a whole year, but I gave up threw the shaver in the trash and went back to a blade. I had an old Philips rotary shaver for years until I dropped and broke it. I bought this because its the top of the line and I had been so please with the old one. What a huge mistake! I wasted $190. Never again will I purchase Philips products. Useless!</li>
            <li> Guys,  This thing is way overpriced and simply does not deliver a \\&quot;breakthrough\\&quot; performance like Norelco claims.... I have used the 1050 now for 4 weeks, and i have to make way too many passes with the thing to get my neck sufficiently. Which, in the process gives me more irritated skin after shaving. The sideburn trimmer really is bad, I am not nit-picking here.    Either drop down a model and save some $$$$$ or go with a Panasonic. I have had like 3 Panasonics and they rock.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor but you should upgrade to the 1090 if your boyfriend/husband likes to have warning of how much time is left until it needs to be charged again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a electric foil razor user for many years.  I&#x27;ve always wanted to try the Norelco 3 floating head style razor.  I finally bought this razor for Christmas 2008.  It&#x27;s neat and easy to handle.  I don&#x27;t like the fact that you can&#x27;t plug a cord directly into the razor.  You have to charge it first with either the charging case or the charging stand.  I also am dissapointed with the time it takes to get a close shave.  With it, I have to keep going over my face repeatedly to get a close shave.  With my Braun foil razor It gives a close shave on just about the first swipe.  This Norelco would probably be a good razor to keep in the car or office.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver when my old Spectra 8894 needed new blades and I am very sorry that I did so.  I can&#x27;t get as good a shave with this new shaver as I can with my old one with worn blades.  I am trying to find out if there is a way I can return it because it is a waste of money.  Additionally, the trimmer is very small and difficult to use because you have to see what you are doing around the cutting heads.  While this is subjective, the unit feels cheap and flimsy compared to my old Norelco.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electric shavers for 30 years.  My last was a Panasonic wet/dry and two Brauns before that.  This one shaves fairly closely; gives a pretty good shave.  It&#x27;s ergonomic and fits well in my hands; comfortable to hold while shaving.  I have a \\&quot;tough\\&quot; beard and it has also performed well after a two day beard growth; takes a little longer but a pretty close shave.  The only time it has \\&quot;grabbed\\&quot; or \\&quot;pulled\\&quot; is with the two day growth; but only minimally.     But, in this day and age of \\&quot;green\\&quot; and trying to save energy, this one is not cool.  The instructions call for rinsing in hot water; a waste of energy.  Yes, one can use the little brush,  or just blow it out.  But Philips says use hot water.  As stated by several (or most) reviewers, the trimmer is the really weak point.  If you have a mustache, this one just doesn&#x27;t perform well at all; just too small and hard to use.  Even with the head removed, it barely trims my mustache.  I guess it&#x27;s okay for occasional side-burn trimming.    I bought this shaver as an Amazon daily deal.  So, for almost half off retail it was a good deal.  But, if you have a mustache and paying retail, I think I&#x27;d shop for another shaver.</li>
            <li> And that doesn&#x27;t only go for razors. This thing is the worst purchase of any kind I&#x27;ve ever made in  my entire life. Nearly $200 worth of junk.    I&#x27;ve used nothing but Norelco razors since I was 15 years old. That is well over 25 years now. I&#x27;ve  bought more than 10 different Norelcos over the years. I had not and would not even consider  buying any other brand of razor. Some were better than others, but none even begins to compare  to this piece of junk. The then 10 year old razor I got as a hand-me-down when I was 15 shaved  100 times better than this piece of crap ever did.     I&#x27;ve always bought the top of line Norelco whenever something new and \\&quot;better\\&quot; came out. This  piece of crap was no exception. Oh how great they made it look on the commercials all over the  TV. The wonder shaver of shavers, they claimed. Just read the company description here on this  page. It is all lies.    Now I&#x27;m not all haired up like a gorilla or anything. I have just normal thickness of hair and  growth. I usually shave every day and with every other Norelco I&#x27;ve ever owned I could get the  job done in less than 3 minutes. Using this hunk of junk it takes well over 15 minutes of rubbing,  scrubbing, and shoving this thing around trying to get it to work. I&#x27;ve tried stretching my skin so  tight that the skin on my neck was pulled up to my earlobe and it still doesn&#x27;t cut the hair. I&#x27;ve  tried going back and forth, up and down, around in circles, clockwise, counter clockwise,  everything imaginable and no matter how you do it, this piece of junk just does not shave.     Even with brand new blades this razor misses about 1 in 10 hairs on my neck. And when I say it  misses them, I mean it completely misses them. They are not cut at all. It misses about twice as  many under the jaw line. And all of this is after 15+ minutes of shaving! So much for their line of  \\&quot;even on the neck\\&quot;.     Oh and don&#x27;t worry, no one will be able to miss that you look like you had a blindfolded 3 year  oldgive you 10 second shave. I can assure you that after nearly half an hour of ramming and  scrubbing this thing around on your neck, it will have a nice red glow for about 2 or 3 hours that  just screams \\&quot;hey look at my 15 minute halfass shave\\&quot;. And I do not even have sensitive skin.    If you plan to use the pop up trimmer it is as big of a joke as the rest of the razor. It is about half  an inch wide and while it does work better than the rest of the razor it sounds like a wood chipper  when it is cutting. Think I&#x27;m joking? Just get one and try it. The first time I used it I actually  yanked it away from my neck. It didn&#x27;t pinch or cut me but the sound of it made me think that it  had.      Oh and do not let me forget, you also get the pleasure of stopping and emptying the hair  chambers at least twice during each shave. If you fail to do this it cuts even worse (if such a thing  is possible) because this razor effectively does not have a place to store what hair it does manage  to cut. There are 3 individual hair \\&quot;chambers\\&quot; on the razor. One for each cutting head. They fill  up very quickly and then begin to puke the cut hair all over whatever you are standing over while  you are \\&quot;shaving\\&quot;.    Now after you clean the bathroom sink (or wherever you were) of all the puked hair, you still get  to clean the razor. Don&#x27;t worry, it is just as easy as running it under the faucet, right? That is what  they claim. Simply running it under the facet works for a few times but that does not get  everything out of the razor and it builds up over the course of a few days.    Now the geniuses that made this piece of junk cleverly decided to make the cutting head all one  piece. Unlike every other Norelco I&#x27;ve ever owned you can not take the cutters out of the combs  and clean them. They are made as all one piece. You cannot even take the cutter and comb out of  the head, everything is all molded together. All you can do is stick the cleaning brush that they  give you (which is asbig a piece of junk as the razor) in behind the cutters and try to scrape out  what you can while spinning the cutter around and around. I quickly wore out the the cleaning  brush they supplied and started using a stiff bristle toothbrush instead. That doesn&#x27;t work very  well either but it is much better than what they give you.    I&#x27;ve tried many different ways of cleaning the heads of this thing and the best way I came up with  was to use a container with a sealable lid and fill it halfway with very hot water. Spray some  cleaner on the head and put it in the container of water and shake it around as hard as you can for  a couple of minutes. I used foaming bathroom cleaner to clean it. Worked well. Might as well use  what you have and with this razor you are going to use a lot of that anyway to clean up all of the  puked hair.    Lastly, if while shaving you are unfortunate enough to get anywhere near to the hair on your head  with this wonder machine, it will suck it up like a Hoover from 3 inches away. Can&#x27;t cut the hair  on your face and neck to save its life but it will grab hold of your hair from 3 inches away a suck  it into the cutters. Now with the other Norelcos I&#x27;ve had that was never too much of a problem.  You just take the cutter and comb apart and take the stray hair out, but remember this was  designed as a single piece so you do not get to do that. I&#x27;ve spent 5 minutes many times, fishing a  single head hair out of one of the cutters.    So in conclusion, just how bad is this razor?    After a year of all of the above I have just completely had it with the piece junk. And like I said, I&#x27;ve never  owned any other brand of razor, but I feel completely lied to, cheated, and ripped off by this razor  and Norelco. My solution: I have just ordered a Panasonic and I will never again buy anything  made by Norelco. I hope they choke on my money, they will never get another cent of it. EVER!    Are you going to give them yours?</li>
            <li> Not much better than the conventional old style Norelcos without the \\&quot;neck.\\&quot; And, worse, must clean after each use, and it is 3X harder to clean because you have to individually open three compartments, using two fingers, after every use or two, compared to the old style where you can just flip it open, easily, with your thumb and clean it every week or two.  That is many hours extra work, over the course of a year or the shaver&#x27;s lifetime.  Not worth the extra trouble.</li>
            <li> Received this arcitec at Christmas, for 30 days I thought what a great razor! For the last 30 days it will not shave at all. Called customer service and they suggested I purchase NEW heads. Do you need new heads every 30 days? Bottom line is customer NO service had no solution and did not offer to replace the heads. Factor in the cost of the heads before you purchase. I did replace the heads and now it works fine. Thanks Philips for all of your assistance.</li>
            <li> Makes one wonder when they definitely tell you \\&quot;Unplug the shaver and do not allow it to charge for greater than 1 hour\\&quot;. Sounds like the old lithium ion safety problem strikes again. Pretty terrible outcome for forgetting to unplug the shaver- one morning.  I guess I can go get a $20 timer and plug it into that to make sure. But for a top-dollar device, one would expect the engineers to design in the required charge termination cycle ?</li>
            <li> I have had this razor since Christmass and what a disapointment.  I have had Norelco tripple heads for years and they all did a great job except this one.  If you miss a few days shaving forget it.  This razor cannot cut longer hairs especially on the neck.  It also takes for ever to do a shave.  The only redeaming factors are the pivioting head and the long battery life.    Considering the price this is a total dud and thus the one star.  Save your money and buy one of thier less expensive razors that have the old fashoned blades that actually shave.</li>
            <li> This was a father&#x27;s day gift for grandpa and it worked out very well. It is easy for caregivers to use and he can even use it himself at times.</li>
            <li> The Norelco 1050 shaves a bit closer than my previous Norelco. It is easier to clean.  The one negative is the trimmer.  It only allows you to square your sideburns.  Positioned under the cutters makes it almost impossible to trim other places.  With my previous Norelco I would square up my sideburns with the trimmer perpendicular to my head. I would then shorten the rest of the sideburns with the trimmer close to parallel to my head.  This latter position is impossible with the 1050.</li>
            <li> I have tested many brands of electric shavers over the decades but I have stayed with Norelco because I prefer their design and performance. My present Norelco, about 5 years old, is still going strong but needs a new battery so I thought I&#x27;d try the Arcitec 1060. It looks very high-tech with its articulated heads, but the bottom line is it shaves no better than my old model. I actually shaved half my face with the Arcitec and the other half with my old one. There was not the slightest difference in the closeness and I had the same amount of stubble on both sides 24 hours later. What&#x27;s more, my old Norelco still has its original blades! It&#x27;s also more solid and I think it&#x27;s nicer to use. Also, the Arcitec has very little space beneath the cutters to hold the beard clippings, so you have to wash the heads after every use. Not a big deal, but I wash my old heads maybe once a week. So the Arcitec is going back. My advice to those in need of a new shaver: Try one of Norelco&#x27;s cheaper models first.</li>
            <li> We currently own the Philips Norelco 7340 Men&#x27;s Shaving System and were Ok with the overall shaving experience. Then we got prompted to buy the Philips Norelco arcitec 1050 Men&#x27;s Shaver after we got influenced by the massive ad campaign of the new arcitec series from Philips. We went ahead and bought the same at $149 during holidays and were utterly dissapointed in the overall performance of the system. The biggest drawback is the tiny little trimmer, which is a joke and one does not realize it until one buy&#x27;s the product and opens it. Just cant imagine the stupidity of the designers and can&#x27;t understand the simple reason as to why they would change a good size trimmer from previous versions to an obscure one which does absolutely nothing. The second drawback is that it gives massive razor burns and after few days I could not even use it on my neck at all. Most of the times I had to use a conventional razor with gel after I had used the Norelco. I found myself shaving twice as Norelco arcitec did not provide a close shave and it was quite annoying. The product is not even worth 25% of its retail value as it does nothing but irritate the skin and mind. I wish Philips had spent money on designing rather than advertisements to offer a better product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had to finally return the product back to amazon as I was not able to use it. Save your money with this one !!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for over 2 months now and overall I really like it.  At first, I didn&#x27;t like the idea of having to clean and rinse it after each use, but really it only takes two seconds to do and I think this actually contributes to the long battery life -which is the one of the great things about this shaver (lasts for 2-3 weeks easy).  Regarding the shave itself, it compares to every other norelco I&#x27;ve had, it gets the job done.  The only reason I can&#x27;t give this 5 stars, is because of how noisy it is... just a little too much for the morning.  Overall good shaver and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s bought me this electric razor for Christmas 2008. Just want to rate the razor on the postive and Negitive&#x27;s.    Postive:    Light weight  Holds charge good  Great stand with sucken cups  Floating heads--Shaves great  Love the color    Negitive&#x27;s    Don&#x27;t like to clean after each shave, but it is a must.  Not very quit as razors go.  Cost---Way over priced.  Don&#x27;t like pop out trimmer. To small.    My opinion only.    Jim</li>
            <li> The Arcitec razor offers a great shave; I don&#x27;t get 3 o&#x27;clock shadow until about 7 pm. The flexible neck and the three independent floating heads make for a very smooth, comfortable and close shave. No razor burn either. Easy clean-up too. The sleek design gives you very good visibility of the shaving area. The charging stations are great. I use the tower at home and the pod when I&#x27;m traveling. Previously, I had two Braun razors, one Remington and used the manual shave (shaving cream etc.) No contest. The Arcitec wins hands down. A truly fantastic razor at a reasonable and competitive price.</li>
            <li> This was my first electric shaver and I really wanted to like it, having gotten it for my birthday; however, shaving with it is miserable. Perhaps I only feel this way because I have been used to a regular Gilette razor and my expectations were too high. Nevertheless, I really do feel like this shaver gives a really bad, uncomfortable shave. Even after a lot of razor burn I still had quiet long hairs left on my neck and on my chin after many passes.     So, some might say that rating one&#x27;s results with a shaver is very subjective and that it might work for some better than it worked for me. While this might be true I have to add that picking up this shaver I really did get the sense that it just wasn&#x27;t designed to give a great shave. Looking at the mechanics you can quickly tell just how unsophisticated the technology behind the shaver is. So, while some might praise it, I really do think that they do so because they are judging it in comparison with some much older (and much worse) electric shavers (shaving with which is probably like shaving with an axe).     Furthermore, looking at this shaver, one gets the sense that its just stupid. Opening all 3 of the razor heads to clean each one and then \\&quot;snapping\\&quot; them back in is kinda silly. Oh, and the trimmer is literally unusable.     Also, about the design... It really isn&#x27;t all that great. Although it does look very modern it reminds me of something envisioned by a child in the 50&#x27;s when asked how the shavers of tomorrow will look like. You also get the sense that the designers had to compromise a lot (like the quality and placement of the trimmer) so as not to compromise the design. The shaver also feels very flimsy and  not well built, much like a toy or a novel gadget.     So, after a week with this shaver I traded it in for a Braun Series 7 Shaver and I highly recommend it. It still doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade however it comes incredibly close. It is much better built, it feels better in the hand and the trimmer is amazing. Even though the Braun is around 70 dollars more expensive I truly feel that if you do not have the money to spend on it then it is better to stick to just using a blade.     Don&#x27;t make the mistake of buying this shaver for its \\&quot;good looks.\\&quot;  You will probably be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used NORELCO shavers for over 30 years. Very good shavers. I&#x27;ve used the NORELCO 1050 for over 1 month now. I like it much better than any of its predecesors.    April 2011 update: Still using it, with new blades. Very satisfied after 3+ years. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I read most of the reviews posted here and it really seems that you are not going to know whether or not the shaver you choose is going to do the job until you buy it and try it. I had tried a number of the Braun style shavers and they just ripped me up, yet others will swear that they are the best you can buy. I have gone back and forth between the razor and my old triple-head Norelco and decided it was time to get a new one. First off, this is a good looking shaver. Feels good, if a little light, in the hand, too. I have waited the recommended 21 days before writing this review and I am very pleased with this product. I have a better than average beard and I more often then not skip a few days on the weekends. The 1050 handles it all, smooth and clean. I rinse it everytime - it&#x27;s so easy - just flip up the blade covers and run it under hot water. The trimmer does seem a bit under powered and does work better when you pop off the razor head. I am very satisfied with the razor and included travel case. Bottom line - if you are already a norelco style user looking to trade up, go for it.</li>
            <li> This my second Norelco, loved both of them. The 1050 trimmer is for the birds. it is hidden under the shaving heads and you can not see it.. Have to guess where it is. Don&#x27;t buy this shaver if you counting on the trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shaved with cheaper razors than this one! I must say, they have done a better job! I&#x27;m still having to shave w/ shaving cream &amp; a razor! It absolutely does not shave as close as it claims!!! DON&#x27;T waist your money! Buy a cheaper one that works!!!! Sorry I waisted my money!!!&lt;br /&gt;Steve</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco for over 30 years and found the Arcitec to be: (1.) Noisier (2.) Does not offer enough weight and support for that comfortable massage of the face while shaving. (3.) Easier to clean but you have to clean more often. (4.) Shave quality the same as the older design and trimming function has always been just adequate which means you should use a razor afterwards in certain areas. (5.) Charging stand does not offer any additional benefit and miss being able to put a cord directly into the razor. (6.) I worry about long term repair costs and reliability vs. the older style.</li>
            <li> For 30-years, I have shaved exclusively with Norelco shavers.  They are the only brand that I&#x27;ve used since I started shaving.  This shaver has caused me to switch to the razor blade!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my old Norelco died, I was thrilled to see this technologically advanced shaver.  I even watched the videos at the company&#x27;s website.  Better yet, I was able to get a new one for only $66 on eBay.  Then the fun ended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver has three advantages:  It looks beautiful, the battery last a long time, and it&#x27;s easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the points that matter most, it fails miserably.  I have tried pulling my skin tight and going over the same area 20-times in each direction (40 passes total!) and it still doesn&#x27;t shave as closely as my old Norelco or my new Gillette Mach 5.  Sad.  The beard trimmer is so tiny it&#x27;s hard to tell when it&#x27;s deployed. It&#x27;s noisy. It takes up more room in the suitcase than my old Norelco&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to like this shaver, I really did.  My son wanted to like it too, but we both concluded that it&#x27;s a failure.  It simply doesn&#x27;t give a close shave.  We&#x27;ve both switch to a blade.</li>
            <li> Actauly I can say that Philips Norelco are the best electric shaver i had found.&lt;br /&gt;I have been used them for over 10 years,&lt;br /&gt;I use to have 7885XL, but I droped and it break&lt;br /&gt;so i find the Artic for repleacment my old shaver&lt;br /&gt;I can say that the Artic has a better design&lt;br /&gt;also it had a good shaver performance&lt;br /&gt;I am sure is quite better but how much better...?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also this time I get the 1050 with out a display&lt;br /&gt;the display raeally doestn improve the shaver and I feel is not worty the extra $50 when the shaver system is the same</li>
            <li> I cannot believe some of the negative reviews on this product.  Heck, one said the head no longer floats, and another said it was the noisiest shaver.  These two comments could not be further from the truth.  I would even say it is probably the quietest shaver I have ever heard in the last 40 years, and the head actually floats both at the body of the shaver, and the actual head.  It truly shaves every nook and cranny of your face with a light touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver also can give you about 16 good shaves per charge.  If you charge it up before you go out of town, (it only takes an hour for full charge) you are good for two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the locking feature so the razor cannot accidently be running in your suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is a little small, but adequate.  And no, you do not end up cutting your hair as some have reported.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is beyond a shadow of a doubt the best razor norelco has ever made, and I have used many of them over the years.  I actually look forward to shaving with it, IT IS THAT GOOD!!!</li>
            <li> Its a good razor, i liked it, but i bought this razor in february thinking that i will get $40 off. never got an email never got any confirmation of any sort about my $40 for future purchase. so if anyone wants to get this razor for the $40 off look else where because you wont get it. other wise its a good razor.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco shavers for many years and prefer them to all other models I have tried.  This review comes from much experience with the brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Arcitec design looks fancy and works well, but gets three average stars because it really works no better than the previous non-space-age, less expensive designs.  The 1050, 1060, and 1090 all operate the same, they just have a different display: none is better than the other, and don&#x27;t waste money on the Cleaner accessory.  It is fairly comfortable to hold (I prefer the feel of the original model because this is one is smaller), and looks fancy sitting on the counter, but it does not do a better job.  It requires cleaning after each use as there is no space for the hairs.  I have always cleaned my shavers after each use anyway.  Unless you just want the apperance, it is not worth the extra money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technically:  The triple-blade per round head (each cutter has three spinning blade areas) does not do any better than a double cutting blade.  Kind of like a Saturday Night Live skit in the 70&#x27;s, Jim Belushi said,  \\&quot;Buy a triple bladed razor.  For those that will believe anything\\&quot;.  Lift-and-cut is a ridiculous concept and a marketing ploy, but Norelco&#x27;s do a nice job.  Norelco went back to more diagonal openings with this model, which is good.  Many other newer models have lots of little pin-holes which are worthless, as the hairs have no time to enter a small hole with shaving motion.  You would have to set it directly on a hair to cut it.  The less pin-holes the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel:  The head design feels better on the neck, and has not caused razor-burn if I do not stretch the skin tight like I need to with the original model.  It takes the same time to shave as my older unit, and I get no better results, no faster.  It takes the same time to get a smooth shave, and the same persistance in some areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Function:  It is a little bit easier to shave under the nose, above my mustache, but not a major difference.  It is much harder to trim my sideburns with this unit as the heads almost cut my hair on my head above the ears the way it is shaped.  Very poorly designed trimmer, so I use my older shaver for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery:  Early, new battery life is good, as with most new battery devices.  But, it states to not over-charge.  Meaning, you need to be around when recharging to unplug it after it is charged; not good for those that shave and must go to work.  The other units would shut off after charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaner/Charger:  Again, one needs to be around when it is finished to not over-charge.  The cleaner is not necessary and a waste of time, money, and chemicals.  I use a razor brush from an older unit, brush it out quickly over the wastebasket (one can&#x27;t blow it out without getting hair dust all over the bathroom, and it can&#x27;t be shaken into the wastebasket as easily as the older models), and I spray it quickly with Remington Silicone Lubricant (I can only find it at Wal-Mart, which is the only thing I ever go there for, by the way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Buy it for looks and keep your old one in the drawer for sideburns.  Nicer on the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would return it, BUT, it was a gift, AND I like the look of it.  I know, I know!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 12-29-07&lt;br /&gt;I purchased a Braun 9595 through J&amp;R on Amazon, and it has a 60 day trial return guarantee.  This is the first micro-screen razor I have used and it is better in all respects to the Norelco Arcitec except for the fancy styling.  It is fast and comfortable, and my face feels razor smooth.

            <li> The shaver works well and is very comfortable. It also looks good. There is a low battery indicator that lets the user know when the shaver needs to be charged.    The head structure dosen&#x27;t have any room to store a lot of clippings so must be cleaned after each use. It&#x27;s easy to clean since you only need open the shave heads and rinse it under running water. I leave the heads open to dry and then close them when I am ready to use it again. It comes with a hard carrying case. If you need to wash the head and then immediately store it when wet, this may be a problem but since I don&#x27;t travel a lot, it&#x27;s not a problem</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a Norelco/Philips rotary shaver, and by definition, the best electric shaver made.  However the trimmer blade--for sideburns, etc., is not easy to use or as effective as the traditional Norelce triple-header shaver.</li>
            <li> Shaver works very well, but the trimmer is too small for what I use it for.</li>
            <li> Overall this is an OK shaver. However it is not as good as my old Braun 7505. Not as close a shave and if you are not careful you will encounter razor burn. Many of the reviews tout how much better this is than the older Norelcos. If that is the case I am sure glad that I have been a Braun user. The biggest plus is the ability to rinse the head with water.</li>
            <li> For the price of this shaver it&#x27;s the worst shave I&#x27;ve ever had. Hard to clean. I have to shave with a blade after shaving with this poor excuse for a shaver. I&#x27;m online now looking for another shaver and it won&#x27;t be a Phillips product. No stars!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Norelco shaver all my life, this is the best one yet! Works perfectly and the price is right. The only&lt;br /&gt;reservation I have is that little side-burn/mustache trimmer, its useless. The shaver tells you when to clean and when to charge. You don&#x27;t need the other one with all the bells and whistles. Good product!!!&lt;br /&gt;HW,</li>
            <li> I have used electric shavers for many years. It seemed that the design of this product should yield a better shave than traditional designs but it did not</li>
            <li> The razor itself shaves very close and leaves a comfortable feeling on the face.  The included travel case protects the shaver very well.  Just now using the charging stand for use when I (Lane) am at home and not on the road.  Only two minor complaints: 1) The trimmer is not very user friendly compared to other Norelco shaver trimmers.  You can&#x27;t see where it is going to be trimming when using it.  It&#x27;s almost like they made it as an after-thought.  2) Charging electronics are not built into razor or charging stand/travel case.  Must use charging power supply that you have to carry with you.  I prefer the old, traditional coiled 2-wire cord system like my previous shavers had!  Overall, though, it is a dynamite shaver and works as advertised!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco Arcitec 1050 men&#x27;s shaver - My husband who is 78 was very pleased to receive this highly advertisied shaver. He is pleased with its performance, but does not believe it lives up to the advertising claims and the package was a real challenge to get into.</li>
            <li> This Electric Shaver is the very best shaving and ease of cleaning it after shaving experience I have ever had.    Thank you Norelco and thank you Amazon for the best price for this magic facial hair removing instrument.    Anthony L. Vitale</li>
            <li> Not that perfect close shave..... it is good if you wanted not a perfect shave but a quick shave, recommended for wet and Dry mode........</li>
            <li> Got this for a gift earlier this year.  Would never spend so much on a razor but I now understand why people do.  Great shaver.  Easy to clean. Close shave.  Cool look.  Most people are familiar with the Norelco design by now, which has different heads pivoting individually to really get the contours of your face.  This one does that and then some.  Better than other Norelcos I have used in the past, although this may be because it&#x27;s a higher-priced, better razor.    I&#x27;m knocking off a star because I feel the price is a bit high for what it does.  Razors at 30% of this cost do just about the same thing.</li>
            <li> On the favorable side, the razor does a good job. The problems involve the battery. Initially it took many hours to charge the battery. Also, even though the razor is cleaned after each shave, it gets hot when used.</li>
            <li> I have owned several razors over the past 20 years. I think this is the best.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these for my teenager for Christmas, and I was envious that he was getting a Norelco that was better than the old man&#x27;s. I mean, it&#x27;s got the high tech looks, the head that swivels to the contour of the face. What&#x27;s there not to like? He was very well pleased with the shaver, and when he filled out the warranty information online, he got a coupon for a discount on another Norelco shaving product. I was all set to purchase my own, but decided to take his out for a spin first. Well, I did like the head that swivels to the contour of the face, but that&#x27;s about as far as it went. For me, it was a rough shave, and it felt similar to a band aid being pulled off of hariy flesh. My old Norelco&#x27;s have never exhibited this sensation, so I was somewhat surprised. I tried it two or three more times but it still felt harsh to me. I haven&#x27;t told my son I don&#x27;t like it because he&#x27;s young and thinks it&#x27;s cool to just be shaving, and the 1050 does have a real 21st Century look to it. However, I did order a replacement set of blades for my old Norelco from Amazon. In my case, it was worthwile to simply keep a good thing going a while longer.</li>
            <li> Well, I had high hopes for this razor but after using it for a few months ago, I must say it is a piece of cool looking crap.&lt;br /&gt;I had a Norelco razor for around 12 years and loved it just bought new blades a few times over the years. Boy I wish I did not give it to my son.&lt;br /&gt;To sum things up This razor does look cool but it sounds cheap the trimmer is crap and it cuts like crap.</li>
            <li> This is the first rotary shaver I&#x27;ve owned, and it is by far the most comfortable shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have very curly whiskers, so they&#x27;re essentially flat ribbons that tend to confound normally-shaped shavers and make it difficult for me to get a close shave when using a razor.  With this shaver, I can go in a circular motion, much more easily catching the whiskers on any part of my face or neck.  While I need to use a pre-shave (like Lectric Shave), I&#x27;ve needed that for every shaver I&#x27;ve used.    Cleaning is much easier with this one than any other I&#x27;ve used.  Simply open the heads and rinse with hot water.  I previously used a Braun Activator, which was self-cleaning but required special cleaning cartridges that cost anywhere from $8 - $12 for a 2-pack; over 4 years of use and regular cleaning, that brought the total cost of ownership of the unit to at least twice what I initially paid for it.    The only caveat with this shaver is the tiny trimmer; since I only use it for my sideburns it isn&#x27;t a big deal for me.  However, if you have a moustache and/or beard you need to trim, you might need a separate trimmer.    Overall I believe this is an excellent shaver for the price.</li>
            <li> Good clean shave, every nook and cranny</li>
            <li> I am a lifelong user of Norelco electric razors (20+ years). I have 3 of them all working. I&#x27;ve had this one for close to 3 years and almost never use it. It shaves poorly, because it cannot be cleaned properly. On the older models you can remove and clean the individual blades. After a week of use, on the older models you can see they need thorough cleaning as residue accumulates at the cutting  edge. This can only be done with a brush, AFTER you remove the blade. The Arcitec doesn&#x27;t allow you to do this. No amount of rinsing in the water will clean the Arcitec heads. Those who say \\&quot;cleans easily\\&quot; don&#x27;t realize that rinsing the cutting head only cleans it superficially. Also as others noted the razor will not hold the whiskers when shaving and will make a mess. The chambers for clippings storage are ridiculously small and you need to empty them after each use. No matter how many passes you take, it will miss some hairs.</li>
            <li> My son said he liked this, he is still using it, it has been about a year now.</li>
            <li> After reading all of the bad reviews on this new Norelco shaver, I swore I was not going to buy this unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, a few months ago I realized my local stores didn&#x27;t stock my HQ5 Norelco replacement blades anymore and I about had a heart attack. Oh, darn, I am now being forced to upgrade and I was quite happy with my current shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had a Norelco 5885XL for the past 13 years. I love this unit and it suits me well. This only noteworthy things about this old unit is that I have had to have the batteries replaced only two times, but this is normal since they wear out every 6 years or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my 1050x review.. it was painful to write, but here goes..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--This is a noisy shaver folks.. I graduated to a 5885XL a long time ago and was surprised of the whisper quiet shave it delivered.  The 1050x is about 2-3 time noisier than my 15 year old Norelco, WTH? This is not good. I simply cannot accept a noisy shaver. This thing is inches away from my ears at 5am and that is very annoying. I need peace and quiet at those early hours, and this would not work long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--What a bad shave. Starting with a 2-day shadow growth, I shaved half of my face with my trusty 5885XL [using 1.5 year old blades] and the other half with my shiny new 1050x unit. I actually had my wife feel both shaves afterwords to confirm I wasn&#x27;t being overly critical of my new toy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I suspected, she confirmed my 5885xl produced a better shave, in about the same amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I shaved with the 1050x, I realized that I was going over the same growth areas without making things smoother, especially around the neck.  I was getting tired, frustrated, and irritated. The pivoting head technology is clearly inferior to Norelcos older units.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Here come the skin irritations: Ahhh!!!&lt;br /&gt;Just a few minutes after my shave test had ended, my 1050x side was now irritated and not feeling comfortable [like my 5885xl side was]. Having used Norelcos all of my shaving life, about 25 years, this irritation I feel is not normal, and I do not find this acceptable; even if there is a break-in period; not for me there isn&#x27;t. no thanks..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Bad charging system!  What the heck is it with this terrible charging system. I should be able to plug the unit in directly and not have to lug around more junk to lose or break while on travel. The AC adapter cable does not even fit into the travel case, how stupid is that!?! I can see this cable being the 1st thing I lose on a business trip because it does not have a place to be stored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gosh, I wanted to love using this shaver. I was excited and wanted to prove all these other bad reviews wrong. Sadly, they are correct in every way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My guess is many of the good reviews are being written by persons who have not had the pleasure of trying one of Norelco&#x27;s older shavers to notice the amazing quality they can provide. Folks, do yourself a favor and get an older model, preferably something from the late 90&#x27;s IMHO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco, come&#x27;on buddy.. Your losing me big time here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s back to my 5885xl, and I have found my HQ5&#x27;s here on Amazon, clicking buy; and it&#x27;s byebye to my 1050x.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;F.25 years, this irritation I feel is not normal, and I do not find this acceptable; even if there is a break-in period; not for me there isn&#x27;t. no thanks..      --Bad charging system!

            <li> I own the top-end Braun shaver (\\&quot;Series 9\\&quot; or something like that).  I thought maybe that this one might work better for my adam&#x27;s apple so I bought this one to compare (with the 45-day return policy at the top of my mind).  Braun is better, as most of the reviews and surveys said.  More expensive (around $200), but I would go for that one if I were you.  It has more muscle and the pulsation thing seems to really work - it digs in where this one seems to glide over the top.  They both are correct, though, when they say that it takes a few weeks for your beard to adjust to the new shaver so you need to give it time before reaching a verdict.</li>
            <li> The shaver works exactly as advertised. It shaves close around all areas of the face and neck and leaves the skin feeling smooth. It does require cleaning after each use but well worth it. I would absolutely recommend this product to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> I have owned a number of Norelco razors, but this one is a dud.  First of all it wouldn&#x27;t cut anything beyond one days stubble, Second it quit charging and is now worthless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the shave this razor gives. Have used various electric razors over the years (Sunbeam,Braun,Norelco) and this is the best. It does the best job in following the curvature of your face. The trimmer however leaves a lot to be desired. It&#x27;s OK for sideburns but if you have to go into a corner the design of the heads get in the way and make it almost impossible. Also the width of the trimmer could be a little wider. I still rate the razor a 4 because I bought it for shaves.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver 18 months ago because I wanted to \\&quot;treat\\&quot; myself.  While the shaver looks good, it has NEVER delivered a close shave-not even a decent shave. I shave over an area for a minute or so and I&#x27;m not even sure I have shaved.  I found a nice little Panasonic wet-dry shaver on Amazon that gives me a nice close shave and costs $30 or 1/4 of what I paid for the Phillips shaver-shame on you Phillips for selling a shaver that should just be a desk sculptue, but should never be used.</li>
            <li> The razor does exactly what I want in a razor.The shave is close and smooth.</li>
            <li> I decided to finally \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; from my 7 year old Norelco with dull blades to this model and have been very disappointed.  Shaving with this model takes twice as long as my older model.  It especially is difficult to shave longer hairs on the neck, I found myself getting impatient and pulling out a razor to quickly finish the job.</li>
            <li> I own this shaver and wish I would have taken it back but waited too long.  Its the worst shaver Norelco has ever made.  It doesn&#x27;t cut good and leaves hairs everywhere.  Plus, it leaves a mess all over your clothes as the heads can barely collect all the trimmed hairs.  I had to switch back to my Norelco Spectra razor, which wasn&#x27;t great but did the job better than this Arcitec razor.  The best shave I got was after I changed the blades out but only lasted a month.  I hear good things about Braun foil shavers and will probably purchase one of these.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I am using Norelco shaver for last four five eyars. Few months back I bought this shaver to upgrade from previous model 8x speedLx. Shaving on the contour of neck and chin was easier then previous before. However a few times when I pressed hard for close shave it did cut the soft skin and produced skin burns, which I never had with any previous model. The worst thing is that it stopped working after 3 months of use. Although Norelco customer service is  outstanding and excellent, but 3 months is no time for a such an expensive item.  I am not sure it is a coincident with me but I found Norelco shavers not reliable. Usually they do not last more than an year. Although it comes with one time warranty replacement, but still it is a risky deal.    I am giving it 3 stars since it was easier to use on contours and that Norelco customer service was excellent. Within five minutes of chat with the representative, replacement was on my way. But if it did not work for an year then it would be my last Noreleco shaver.</li>
            <li> The Arcitec is replacing my almost 3 year old [[ASIN:B0012TLPBQ Philips Norelco Speedxl Men&#x27;s Shave]] which served me well for all this time but, when the time came to replace the old 8140XL&#x27;s heads I happened to notice that a brand-new Arcitec was available as a &#x27;lightning deal&#x27; for some $35 more so I took advantage of the opportunity. After several weeks of using it I can say that the Arcitec is &#x27;better&#x27; that the 8140XL and I am therefore pleased with my purchase. While the end result of shaving is basically the same which is not surprising because the Arcitec implements the same &#x27;lift and cut&#x27; technology, it appears to be much gentler to my skin, the more flexible shaving heads better follow my face and neck, has a better grip, comes with a more protective storage/charger pod and, of course, is prettier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, let&#x27;s go into some details:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PACKAGING, CONTENTS AND PRESENTATION&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver comes to you inside a triple-layered protective/defensive enclosure, hard plastic over cardboard over another clamshell (but easy to open) protective plastic layer. It&#x27;s not totally bullet-proof but it probably ensures that most units don&#x27;t suffer any damage while in transit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inside I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The shaver itself&lt;br /&gt;- Super-protective (for travel mostly) charging pod&lt;br /&gt;- Cleaning brush&lt;br /&gt;- Charging stand&lt;br /&gt;- Sliding razor head cap&lt;br /&gt;- 100/240V power cord&lt;br /&gt;- User manual and warranty statement (English/Spanish)&lt;br /&gt;- Quick start guide card&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking the shaver out of its packaging, understanding its operation and making it work was relatively easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manual, covering FOUR separate models is surprisingly well written to the extent that you are not annoyed by having to find the paragraph that applies to your specific model so, know thy model number (it&#x27;s a 1050). It covers everything, from features, charging options, shaving tips and techniques, cleaning, storage and replacement of the razor head. I&#x27;ve actually read it and I am better off for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FEATURES AND OPERATION&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charging&lt;br /&gt;--------&lt;br /&gt;This is one of Arcitec&#x27;s better features. The manual claims (verified) that it can take a full charge in about one hour and, once charged. I didn&#x27;t count shaving minutes but, at least with a brand-new battery you won&#x27;t need to recharge it very often. In &#x27;emergencies&#x27;, just 3 minutes of charging should give you 3 minutes of shave time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no way to replace the battery inside the shaver but, based on my experience with Architec&#x27;s precursor, my 2.5 year old 8140XL, this should not be an issue. After all these years the battery still allows me to shave several times before a recharge is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You charge your shaver by either placing it on the charging stand or inside the charging pod. Philips recommends that you do not keep the charging stand continuously connected to the power outlet and I have no problem with that. One one-hour charge session keeps my shaver going for several weeks (I only shave 2-3 times per week).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving&lt;br /&gt;--------&lt;br /&gt;The feature most of us buy a shaver for :)... It&#x27;s okay, for an electric shaver. I won&#x27;t say that \\&quot;it&#x27;s as close as a blade\\&quot; because it isn&#x27;t but that&#x27;s not why I switched from blade shaving to electric some 7 years ago. I am using an electric shaver because shaving with a blade had my skin irritated, especially on my neck. The 8140XL was okay but my neck still felt uncomfortable. The Architec does NOT irritate my neck at all and this is a very good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The above comes with a price. Shaving takes a lot longer. You need to go over the same area several times before all the hairs are &#x27;lifted and cut&#x27; but that was a tradeoff I understood and I accepted. Norleco claim that the Arcitec has \\&quot;50% more shaving surface\\&quot; (compare with the old 8140XL claim of \\&quot;up to 50% more shaving surface\\&quot;) is just marketing hype and always left me ask myself \\&quot;50% more than what?\\&quot;. The reality is that the 3 heads together add up to a decent shaving surface, and the Arcitec&#x27;s are not larger than the 8140XL&#x27;s but I would not call them &#x27;humongously large\\&quot;. And, again, contrary to marketing claims, shaving with the Arcitec or with just about any other electric shaver is not &#x27;fast&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I noted before, the Arcitec is very gentle to my skin and this is the main reason, other than good looks, that I prefer it over the older model. Sometimes you need to go several times over the same neck spot because &#x27;lift and cut&#x27; is good but not perfect but my experience with the Arcitec is that my skin tolerates it pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer&lt;br /&gt;--------&lt;br /&gt;A small trimmer can be pulled out when needed. I am not going to use it that much but I was able to successfully and quickly trim my mustache. It&#x27;s a useful feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other bells and whistles&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------&lt;br /&gt;When needed, a number of indicators/warnings discretely light up on shaver&#x27;s body: low battery, charing indicator, needs cleaning indicator, travel lock and shaving head replacement indicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MAINTENANCE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like spending a lot of time taking care of my shaving tools and the Arcitec does not need a lot of maintenance. Each of the 3 individual heads can be opened and the hair fragments stored inside are washed away in seconds. Any that don&#x27;t go can be removed with the providing brush. It&#x27;s possible to also use liquid soap or degreasing liquid (alcohol) solutions for cleaning but I haven&#x27;t yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer, if used extensively, could use a couple of drops of mineral oil once or twice per year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco recommends that the full shaving head assembly is replaced once a year and an &#x27;replace head&#x27; indicator should light up on the shaver when that time comes but we are not there yet and I will be making that decision when the time comes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUPPORT AND WARRANTY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a 45-day money back guarantee. Philips Norelco promise to fully refund your purchase price if you ship them back the product within 45 days of your purchase date. You will be paying for shipping and insurance and they are not responsible for lost items - therefore the need for insurance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, there is a 2-year limited warranty and warrants against defects and, of course, you lose coverage if you abuse your shaver or you try to fix it your self or through unauthorized repairers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 800 numbers you need to call for support or warranty service are printed on several locations on the box and on the manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made in Holland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DESIGN AND ERGONOMICS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;The looks&#x27; is clearly Arcitec&#x27;s distinguishing feature. I like it but I&#x27;m not going to say more because everyone can see the images posted on Amazon&#x27;s page. As I noted above, all indicators and warnings light up when only when needed and are invisible at any other time. The Arcitec&#x27;s body shape makes for a very comfortable grip while shaving. I also appreciated the little suction cups at the bottom of the charging stand that add to its stability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging pod, on the other hand, is a little too bulky and it&#x27;s not easy to close/open and it can&#x27;t store then shaver while the heads cap is on. I didn&#x27;t take it on the road yet but, when I do I may appreciate how it protects my shaver but, on the other hand, I don&#x27;t believe any of my shavers was ever damaged while travelling so I&#x27;m not so sure the bulkiness is justified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I wish there was some &#x27;case&#x27; to carry or store everything. The way the shaver comes, it&#x27;s possibly to store it inside the pod but then the heads cap, the cleaning brush and the charging cord are &#x27;outside&#x27; and they are easy to lose, especially the first two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY RATING&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with my purchase and Arcitec is now my &#x27;regular&#x27; shaver. Losing the occasional red spots on my neck was very much worth it. Besides the comfortable shave the Arcitec comes with pretty good support (money back promise, 800 support number), looks good and, based on my prior experience with an earlier Philips Norelco shaver, is likely to last for a long, long time. Some of the marketing claims: quick shave, 50% larger (than what???) are a little bit exaggerated but... that&#x27;s what our reviews are for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hesitated between 4 (I like it) and 5 (I love it) stars. If you expect the Arcitec to fulfill all the marketing claims, you may be slightly disappointed but if you know what to expect from an electric shaver and understand that real-world miracles are very rare, then a 5 star may be the fair rating. I will do a 4 stars at this time for a good quality, well designed electric shaver that appears to be an incremental improvement over previous generations but whose capabilities may be a little over-hyped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt; Brush your teeth, it&#x27;s the law! &amp;lt;&amp;lt;ems - therefore the need for insurance.

            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this shaver for about 5 days now and I get disappointed about my purchase day by day due to the following reasons: Misses hair a lot especiall in the neck area, causes rashes, and requires mini scissors or actual blade to get rid of missed neck hair.....I REALLY wanted this shave to be the one because it was the most expensive shaver I bought..I do not recommend this product to anyone and especially people with sensitive skin. I&#x27;m going to ask Philips for my money back..</li>
            <li> This razor does provide the closest shave I have ever had from an electric razor.  It is especially good on the neck.  Cleaning is simple, and recharging only takes 1 hour.  A symbol lights up to indicate you need recharging well before you lose power, so I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ll ever have the experience of running so low on power that I can&#x27;t comfortably finish shaving.  There is one serious design flaw that should be noted.  The mustache and sideburn trimmer is placed below the razor head in the back and is useless without a second mirror.  Luckily I have a different razor for those purposes.  If the trimmer is important to you, this is not the product you want.  If you are simply looking for a good shave, I&#x27;d say give this a try.</li>
            <li> I have been a loyal Norelco user since I was 21. My grandfather was a Norelco user and he was my idol, so while I had braved the cuts and waste of money and time of creams and razors-and yes they are closer shaves for a lot more money-and blades that cost about same as gasoline, I have always felt that if I shower first to soften my tough beard, then let my beard dry a bit, the Norelco was almost as good as a blade. Not with this baby. I was devastated that my wife gave me this requested gift and could not get it at Costco (now I know reason) and found that I had to go back to my 8270 xl in order to complete my shave under my nose, on my cheeks and on parts of my neck.     First off the heads do not float and the triple head which I expected to give and get into places where i normally have to go over again actually is firmer and makes me have to repeat 3, 4 argg 5 times. Then I found short blond peach fuzz left on my face like women&#x27;s facial hair-what is with that-am I becoming mutant? Nope, the old Norelco got rid of it right away. I was always concerned when Phillips bought this company that they would try to make the razor more of a Phillips style razor and I did notice incorporations on the 8270 but they made it better. I FIND i I use the 8270xll to shave then if I touch up in a few areas with the arcitec I can get closer in a few spots but i idid not fork over 140 bucks for a touch up trimmer. And what is with the trimmer, you cannot trim anything or cut your hair with this trimmer-you cannot even see what you are doing should you want to do a quick side burn or sides of your hair trim as with other Norelcos.  As I ordered from a far away discounter and I tried the usual month thinking maybe my beard had to change again in some odd way to make this work--i noticed they sell one that comes with a Nivea dispenser-maybe will try that but for now this is just a total loss IMHO-not even sure to buy replacement blades as I just ordered the HQ9s for the 8270xl. I nowsee they have 2 newer versions that look like this and the latest has better reviews. I think as a fair courtesy Phillips Norelco should offer all arcitec owners a 50 percent off if they trade in their old arcitec for the new one as I feel totally ripped off, almost angry enough to switch to Braun but i fear my face would be ripped off.. alas Norelco my old co. what happened? My grandpa is shedding a tear in heaven-a family tradition may be broken if this keeps up..</li>
            <li> I think these razor reviews tell us that there&#x27;s no one razor that&#x27;s just right for all. I&#x27;m a die hard Norelco fan. I&#x27;ve used this razor for a few years and I like it a lot. Some guys have wiskers that are just not suited for electric shaving period. Some people think foil shavers are the only way to go. I used to use an early foil remmington years ago. I liked it, but I had to use the shave talc stick to get a good shave so I had replace the foil and cutter about three times a year.  For about seven or 10 bucks at the time I didn&#x27;t care. but they were cheap (about 30 busks) and lasted only about 18 months. I went back to Norelcos but I always had that neck irritation (something the Arcitech does not cause for me). I then tried a braun foil shaver that caused an infected ingrown hair within a week. My wiskers just don&#x27;t like jumping into those foil holes, they want to lay down. I&#x27;ve learned a lot from shaving blogs and Amazon reviews. I now have a skincare regime (I found out this is essential), that includes NEVER skipping days, washing with an exfoliant scrub two to three times a week, using Lectric shave when shaving and using lots of skin care balm (I like the Loreal product with SPF-15 in it the best. I shave with light pressure in reverse circles to the head comb angles and then vertical and horizontal stokes when I get real close. If I line up a side of the triangle of heads, it&#x27;s like having 12 cutters pass over my face at once and this can result in quick shaves. I never have irritation. The tactile feel of closeness is as good as a blade shave for me and very comfortable. If I feel like I want to get super duper shiny close I wil wet my face. My shave takes about four minutes tops. I&#x27;m not trusting the new Norelco &#x27;3D&#x27; razor. I want as much cutting surface on my face as possible so the open channel design that &#x27;catches the long hairs&#x27; is for guys who want to let it grow a day or two or more. Keping it close is essential. Once in a while I will give it a one minute quick shave in the evening. The three cutting tracks help shave me faster. With my old one track norelco it takes several more minutes to get close.  This results in blade wear and some irritation as well as shortened battery longevity requiring replacement. Cheers, happy shavingne minute quick shave in the evening. The three cutting tracks help shave me faster. With my old one track norelco it takes several more minutes to get close.

            <li> My husband loves this shaver. It is so much easier for him to use this on a daily basis. However, if you forget to shave for a day or two, you end up having to use a razor first, as thick beard hair has a harder time in this razor.</li>
            <li> I have it for over 3 years now and even after all the marketing hype and mixed reviews I got it but unhappy with it. The best I ever had was a panasonic and I will get one next. This just looks good but shaves are not very good</li>
            <li> This is the fourth generation of Norelco Electric&#x27;s I&#x27;ve owned and I must say it&#x27;s hands down the best.  My previous Norelco the \\&quot;James Bond\\&quot; Spectra has served me well.  It was a comfortable shave but took me a good five minutes to get that real close &#x27;blade&#x27; smooth shave.  With the new Arcitec 1050X that time is about cut in half and the shave is on par with a blade.  Totally different feel that the heavier Spectra. The new design eleminates the need for the pressure adjustment wheel on the older model.  The flex head design works very well.  Cleaning is a breeze with the flip out heads.  The hard shell travel case is nice.  The razor charges in the case or stand.  The trimmer is just OK and will take a little getting used to because of it&#x27;s location in relation to the head.  I didn&#x27;t see the need to spend more for one of the models with a few more bell&#x27;s and whistles.  Over all a great electric.  A bit pricy but well worth it to me and for anyone that chooses an electric over a blade.</li>
            <li> I am liking this razor more and more every time I use it.  It has a sleek design and is much lighter (the sides are made of carbon fiber).  The shaving experience is much different; a clever design change, which I like.    The main cutter assembly (RQ10, which Amazon sells for $35) attaches to the body and pivots like a joystick. This design change reduces shave time immensely because all 3 cutter heads glide over your face/whiskers at the same time.  A great improvement over the standard Norelco where 1, 2 or 3 of the cutter heads are used in varying combinations.    This razor does especially well on 2 or 3 day old beards. It mows down the whiskers without any ripping or pulling. It sounds like it!  The motor is a bit loud; a more powerful loud. The lithium ion battery is the latest and best battery technology.  Full charge time is only 30 minutes.    One of my pet peeves with current and past Norelcos is placement of the power button, which I would accidentally turn it off with my right thumb (onc certain models).  I don&#x27;t have that issue with this model; the power button is lower.    I would have given it 5 stars if not for the poor trimmer, like most reviewers mention.  I don&#x27;t know why they call it a tube trimmer. I would call it a micro trimmer! Much too small.  Hang onto your old Norelcos for trimming!    Overall I am extremely pleased with the new Arcitec and recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have ready many user reviews and some technical reviews on the Norelco Arcitec and it has brought me to three conclusions: 1) You can&#x27;t please everyone but you CAN please most 2) Some of the reviews must have been written by the competition and 3) A little more attention to detail will help some of you understand the product better.    I have been mostly a blade man for about 25 years, having only made a few brief attempts at using an electric.  For the past several years, I have been using the Gillette Mach 3 and now the Fusion razors.  They are the best blades ever, give a quick close shave and cost so much money  to replace ($28.99 msrp for 8 blades), that if I changed them out when I really should (weekly is ideal and almost necessary they go dull so fast), I will have paid for the Norelco Arcitec 1050 plus a little extra, in just one year of use.    In the interest of trying something new, I have tried electrics before.  I tried Norelco&#x27;s first generation of the Nivea wet shaver and it was great, though it did run out of Nivea fast, which was hard to find and expensive and then I got bored and distracted and stopped using it almost as quickly as I started.  BUT, it is still a work horse and whenever I break it out of retirement, and it still does a great job, even with worn out blades.    So, I decided to give the Arcitec a try.  First, everyone comments on design and style, so let&#x27;s get that out of the way.  Great, innovative, light, maneuverable, and incredibly effective.  I am NOT a dry shave guy.  I only do it out of necessity when I am in a hurry.  I have always found that wet shaving, even with my other Norelco which can do either, was WAYYY better and more comfortable.  But, this is enough to convert me in just one use.  Quick, smooth, effect, close, comfortable.      Let&#x27;s debunk a couple of design complaints I have read about in previous reviews...      The trimmer...Yes, the trimmer may be a bit small, but I have a small face, and I almost never usea trimmer, so no biggie.  BUT, one of the complaints I have read several times is that placement is bad because \\&quot;you end up cutting your hair with the razor when you try to use the trimmer\\&quot;.  People... the razor head pops off!  Just pull it off when you are using the trimmer.  It&#x27;s pretty obvious you are supposed to.  Which leads me to...    Replacing the blades...Other&#x27;s have complained that you can&#x27;t replace the blades, just the entire head from the neck up and that appears to be true.  One user even said it costs almost as much as a new razor.  Rubbish!  It&#x27;s $33 and change on Amazon for a new razor head.  It will probably be less by the time any of us actually need to buy replacements.  When was the last time you replaced the blades in an electric razor (O.K., a GOOD electric razor) for under $30?  Assuming you do it once a year, you will pay what yo would for one 8 pack of Fusion blades.     Cleaning the blades... you have to open three small slots, instead pushing one button for one big chamber.  It takes three seconds, so what?    There isn&#x27;t a big hair chamber...  Again, so what?  I always hated having a bunch of hair gather in my razor.    The battery supposedly can be damaged by over charging, unlike previous models.  Most likely, Norelco is just being careful.  The nature of lithium ion and lithium polymer batteries is that they CAN&#x27;T be over charged, they have no burn in memory, and are safe to leave in the charge at all times. Even my old first-gen Norelco Nivea razor with cheap NiCad batteries, could be left in the charger forever and it never burned and still holds a charge for months or even years.  You can take the risk and leave it in the charger.  I did it all afternoon and evening yesterday with no notable problems.    One last observation, and I&#x27;m not the first one to make it...  The only difference between the 1050, 1060 and 1090 razors is the LED.  Each one offers a little more detail than the rest, but costs noticeably more for that detail.In all other ways each razor is the same.  Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but why pay up to $100 more for a unit that does all the same things?  I don&#x27;t care if mine has an LED that says I have 65 minutes left.    So, nutshell... great design, great performance, great everything.  Take negative opinions with a grain of salt.  With a 60 day return policy to Norelco, it&#x27;s worth a trial run.  I&#x27;ve only had it for a day and I already like it enough to keep it.    By the way, if you like wet shaving, it looks like it can do that too.</li>
            <li> It was tough to decide whether or not to give this product one or two stars, but I gave it two because it doesn&#x27;t completely suck, it&#x27;s just not as good as other razors that aren&#x27;t as expensive The manufacturer recommends waiting 21 days before deciding to keep this product or send it back. I would also give the same recommendation to people who are looking at purchasing this. I bought it because I needed to replace my old razor. My old Remington titanium R9710 was a good razor but it ripped the hair out of my neck area and left me with very irritated skin. The thing about my old razor is that it had floating heads and it handled long hairs pretty well if I was lazy and didn&#x27;t shave. This new Arcitec worked very well when I first got it but I really wanted to try it out and only had stubble on my face at the time. It worked very well with short hairs and left me with no irritated skin on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I wanted to see what it would act like if I let my hair grow a little and it did not perform like I thought it would. It took a long time to shave and I had to go over the area multiple times in multiple directions and with different pressures just to get a few long hairs. This new head style has really been a downgrade because when you apply pressure, the heads seem to pull away from your face on the outside part of it and it makes it harder to shave. It was either that or the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a hair collection area. It fills up with hair rather quickly so maybe that has an impact on how well it shaves. Cleaning the unit was very simple but I think I would have the cleaning system of one of the speed XL models over this. You have to pop open three separate chambers rather than flip the whole head up to clean each blade. A nice feature of this razor is the tube trimmer. You can take the razor head right off and pop out the trimmer. There really isn&#x27;t much else to say about the trimmer other than I thought it worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a very nice looking razor, but the functionality of the razor itself is pretty bad. It does come with a nice travel case and charging stand as well. The travel case is made of hard plastic and does not have room for the charger, but it does have the capability to charge the razor, so you do not need to bring along the charging stand. If you want to try this product I would say go for it because Norelco has such a generous return policy and maybe you will like it better than I did. If you think you like the functions of this razor but really aren&#x27;t sure about it, I would not recommend it because it doesn&#x27;t work like I think a razor should (it takes a long time to shave and it doesn&#x27;t work well on longer hairs). It looks nice and has nice features, but I think its functionality isn&#x27;t worth the high price tag.king razor, but the functionality of the razor itself is pretty bad.

            <li> Is there an electric razor that does not throw clippings all over your shirt, counter, etc??? when shaving dry?  OK in the shower.</li>
            <li> The razor worked great on the beard on my face, but NOT AT ALL on the hair that grows under my chin!  Like all other razors I have tried, it left an unpleasant rash and did not clip the hairs closely.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my son.  I have an Philips Norelco arcitec 1050 Men&#x27;s Shaver and really like it.</li>
            <li> This shaver has replaced my Norelco 8825XL. I have found the Arcitec to out perform the 8825XL in the time it takes me to shave and shaving in  tight shaving areas below the sideburns and upper lip. I did not give the shaver a five star rating because, I thought it to be a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco razors for years, so I looked forward to this top of the line new model. What a disappointment! The design is far out, way too far out! It gives a very poor shave and causes razor burn at the same time. I had thought that these two conditions were mutually exclusive, but Phillips has managed to put them both in this razor. I would not recommend the purchase of this product. The battery life is excellent between shaves, other than that it really is an inferior product.    I replaced it with a Norelco 8240XL which is excellent and half the price.    If I were Phillips, I would do what Ford did with the Edsel and withdraw it from the market before it damages their reputation any further.</li>
            <li> I was using any number of triple blade razors with no problems except that they are messy having to use shaving cream so I decided to give the Noreclo a try.  For the price I thought it would work great since I had heard that high end electrics work well.  After using the Norelco arcitec 1050 exclusively for a month I was still having rasor burn and not getting a good shave on my neck.  It was also impossible to get a clean line for my sideburns.  I read and followed all the directions but was very disappointed in this razor.</li>
            <li> I grew up using electric shavers, and until recently had never ever used a multi-blade razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this shaver at least 3 times a week for about 2 years. During that time I needed to change shaving heads twice (which seems fairly normal to me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I liked about this razor are that it holds a charge for a reasonably long time, it does a decent job, and it lasted me a fairly long time. I feel like I got my money&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like about it was that the blades had a really tough time snagging hairs when it&#x27;s warm or humid. You definitely need to make sure that your face is very dry when using it, or else you&#x27;ll find yourself pressing it against your skin to try to pick up a stray hair that it missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I would mention is that it had a habit (especially toward the end of its life) of yanking on hair or two when I shaved with fairly thick stubble. Nothing too awful, but a surprising jolt now and then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it does a reasonable job in a pinch, and for a long time I never really knew what a good, close shave felt like so I was always content with what I got out of this shaver. For something that you will be using several times a week, I would put down a few extra $$ and get a nicer model.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor on Sept. 11th 2010 and it died this morning. No lights, no charge, nothing. I don&#x27;t recommed this product, obviously.</li>
            <li> I read with interest, the most favorable review for this shaver. This person mentioned that this is their first electric shaver after a lifetime of using blades. I guess if that is the case, the reviewer doesn&#x27;t have much to compare this product with. Having had previous Norelco models as well as a Remington and a couple Brauns... I have a bit more actual experience with competing products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few years back, we bought a second home. We decided to stock our vacation home with everything needed so that we would not have to carry luggage and we could just head to an airport and go. I had used Norelco shavers for a number of years. About 10 years ago, my wife bought me a Braun 7 series shaver. What a difference. It gave me a much smoother and closer shave with less chafing and discomfort. I wasn&#x27;t and still am not impressed with the so-called cleaning system that Bruan has designed. But the shaver itself was terrific. About 2 years ago, the battery in my beloved Braun started to fail. So I bought a new 790CC Braun Shaver. This one was even better than the first. So as we gathered things to take to our second home, I asked my wife to pick up another Braun shaver. The 790CC is not an inexpensive product. So my thrifty wife, knowing I had used Norelcos in the past, picked up the Arcitec shaver on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a disappointment! To be honest, I can&#x27;t find anything that is a distinct positive about this product. Let me organize my thoughts just a bit...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Size - The shaver head is just too big. It is hard to maneuver in tight areas such as at the upper lip and nose. Requires using the trimmer to get acceptably close.&lt;br /&gt;2. Performance - I do not have a heavy beard. I find that 24 hours of growth is the limit for this shaver. If your facial hair is allowed to grow for any longer than that, the shaver will not cut it. If you have a heavy beard, this shaver simply wont do the job.&lt;br /&gt;3. Cleaning - The heads clog very quickly. Once they do, theshaver will not cut at all. The Braun by comparison, can usually go a week before cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;4. Trimmer - As others have said... Small and in an awkward position. It&#x27;s foolish to suggest that the shaver head should be removed to facilitate trimming. Better to suggest that the Phillips/Norelco engineers should take a crack at a better design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this shaver intermittently for the last two years. My older Norelcos were far better than this one. So that being said, I finally decided enough is enough and ordered another Braun from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a very good quality electric razor that delivers a good shave. I have had the same shaver for four years. It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade, but if you change out the shaving heads every six to 12 months, you will get a consistantly good shave.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this is one of the poorest razors I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) impossible to clean the heads. Flip the cover and try to clean it. The manual says to use water but it does not help.&lt;br /&gt;2) The razor will not hold the whiskers when shaving - look at your shirt when your done, its all over your clothes.&lt;br /&gt;3) It seems like its always dull, even with a new head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing looks cool, the battery lasts a long time but it does not shave very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went back to my 965RX</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Arcitec shaver for about 3 years now and have very mixed feelings, though mostly negative, about it.  The pluses: Battery life is great if you wait until the battery is nearly fully discharged as the manufacturer recommends.  I use it every day and it lasts for 3 to 4 weeks on a full charge.  Also, it shaved pretty closely when the head was new, although it is still tough to shave the neck and jawline - despite the ads. Now the minuses:  The head lasts less than a year with regular use and the replacement head costs about the same as a year&#x27;s-worth of brand-name razor replacements.  After my 3 years of use, it&#x27;s cost me well more than twice what continuing with \\&quot;old faithful\\&quot; would have cost when considering the price of the shaver and scheduled replacement heads.  I think when my current shaving head wears out - and it&#x27;s well on its way - I&#x27;ll go back to blades and shaving gel.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor because I thought it would be an improvement over my old Norelco. Wrong! To get a close shave you have to use Lectric Shave lotion and it is impossible to clean because you can&#x27;t remove the cutting blades from the heads like you could with the old Norelcos. And, there is not a good solution to this problem on the internet and the manual is no real help.</li>
            <li> very good....working without problem for two years..and still using it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get the accolades. I bought this thinking that more expensive is better and in reality, the exact opposite is true. It does almost nothing. I have tried shaving wet, dry, with preshave gel and liquid. No matter what I try this thing does a horrible job of shaving. Maybe it&#x27;s me or my beard. I guess for some others it works fine but considering the price and the hype is should work a lot better. Or maybe I should rephrase, it should work period. I recently bought the Wahl Trimmer Shaper for almost $250 less and it does a FAR superior job.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s wrong with these other guys, but I got a 1050X for Christmas, and I have NEVER had a shave with an electric shaver as close and smooth as this one - and I&#x27;ve had ONLY Norelco shavers for the 45+ years that I&#x27;ve been shaving.    The 1050X is lightweight, easy to hold, and the heads move so effortlessly to the contours of my face that it&#x27;s really a pleasure to use.  I can only guess that the negative reviews that I see here were made by some shills from Braun.  Try it, you WILL like it.  If not, you can always get your money back selling it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The first really \\&quot;out of the box\\&quot; Norelco in years.  Does most of what it says.  very flexible.  gets into hard-to-reach spaces.  Must be cleaned constantly, however, and Lithium Ion battery is different than prior batteries and takes a lot of getting used to.  Not sure it&#x27;s the best razor they have ever made, but with refinements and tweaks it probably will be.  Very expensive, however.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shaver!  He says it gives the closest shave than any other shaver he has owned ( we have been married 33 years and wow, his face feels so smooth!  Great product!</li>
            <li> This was a christmas gift for my brother. He does like this and is very pleased with it. It does have a nice beard and mustach trimmer that flips out. It feels nice and comfortable in the hand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the coolest electric razors I&#x27;ve seen. I bought the 1050CC. I couldn&#x27;t wait to get this one. I love Norelco&#x27;s products. I bought this shaver and tried it for a couple of weeks and found it delivers a really harsh uncomfortable shave with lots of razor burn which I never got from my other Norelco. I think one reason for the harsh shave is that it doesn&#x27;t have the floating heads anymore that easily give to the contours of your face, this seems to plow into curves instead and you also don&#x27;t get the range of pivoting that the previous models have (I noticed this didn&#x27;t surround my Adams Apple like my 9170XL does it sits flat on it). It gives a decent shave but not a great shave like I was hoping and you have to go over areas many times. I think who ever designed this razor just went for how sleek and cool they could make it look and the function came second. You can get as good of shave with a 9170XL SpeedXL which has the same cutting head technology and gain the comfort and save $120. It just won&#x27;t look as cool on your counter.  Sorry Norelco but when I spend $200 dollars I just don&#x27;t want something that looks good I want it improved too. I talked to the Corp. office, in regard to this. Their Demanor was  \\&quot;it is the finest razor we have ever made\\&quot;. VERY UNTRUE.  I have used Norelco for many years, ( I am 71) This is the WORST razor I have ever owned. Bar None</li>
            <li> My 22-year-old son has a heavy beard and very sensitive skin. The result, with razor shaves, was bad razor burn and acute discomfort. I bought him this razor for an early Christmas present, and the results are excellent. It takes constant use for a few weeks to get one&#x27;s skin used to an electric razor, including this one, but well worth it. Great product.    Sheila in Chicago</li>
            <li> Checked with my husband and he says it is definitely a 5 star.  This is the 2nd Phillips Norelco shaver I bought for him in the past several years, so brand loyalty is there.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves it.  He also is happy with the trimmer that is part of this razor.  This is not his first Norelco, but it is the first Arcitec model that he has had.</li>
            <li> The product is perfect. I bought two of this kind of products for my father and my husband. They all liked the product very much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Norelco user for 30 plus years, love their quality of product and shave. Only negatives about the Arcetec style, they are noisier and you have to clean the heads at least every other shave because there is no where for shavings to accumulate. If you are a Norelco user and you like the \\&quot;look\\&quot; of the Arcetec style, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Bought it as there was this 45 days not good money back garantee. But I liked it. I have a difficlut skin, but no problems with this shaver. Believ Philips is doing a great job in their constant development of their shavers. Happy men!</li>
            <li> I started out liking this razor even though it did leave me with razor burn I was not accustomed to with other electric razors. However one I replaced the heads it was never the same since. The heads never stay in after you pull them out the first time (as instructed by the mfg. instructions) to replace them. I can&#x27;t get through a shave anymore where the heads don&#x27;t just pop off the razor. It is extremely frustrating and I will never waste my money on another Norelco product. If I could have given this a 0 stars I would have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned 4 Norelco&#x27;s over 15 years and each new one is worse than the last one.  This latest Arcitec with its lack of replacable blades is why this company should go under.  Stop buying their stuff.</li>
            <li> This is the worst shaver EVER. Can only cut peach fuzz and cleaning the thing is a nightmare. Who ever designed this thing should be fired</li>
            <li> Do NOT even think of buying the Norelco Arcitec.  In fact, from what I now know, I would strongly recommend not buying any Norelco products. First of all, it is noteworthy to understand that Norelco has discontinued ALL service operations in the US and Canada. Can you imagine that your shaver&#x27;s battery will need replacement in the next couple of years? Sorry, Norelco has NO OPTIONS for that replacement. I guess that works for them since they hope you will then buy a new shaver.  You will also notice on the Norelco Architec shaver that the cord can NOT be inserted into the shaver, but only into the charger. When the battery can no longer be charged, it can not be powered by the cord either. Next, you will want to consider the RQ12+ Replacement Head. While the original Architec head shaves smoothly, fast and close, the new RQ12+ is poorly manufactured and has the following problems. 1. It has bigger holes and causes the shaver to actually jam on a thick 2 day beard growth. 2. The movable heads now have edges that protrude against the contours of your face and they will catch on your chin and elsewhere. 3. Shaves with this RQ12+ take longer. 4. Shaves with the RQ12+ are not nearly as close. Thankfully, I kept the old original head, and after suffering through the RQ12+ for a 45 days, replaced it with the original head that had 1 year of wear.  Immediately, I noticed that the original head was smoother, closer and faster. There really was NO comparison! It is now clear to me that making cheaper products and offering no service is Norelco&#x27;s new business model.  I have spoken with their customer service reps twice and they simply take notes an apologize. They can offer NO remedies to my concerns, and only indicate the &#x27;company line&#x27; that the new RQ12+ is &amp;#34;better&amp;#34;. This is absolute baloney and, obviously, clear indications of just one more corporation that has been taken over by Greed and Deception. You have been warned!</li>
