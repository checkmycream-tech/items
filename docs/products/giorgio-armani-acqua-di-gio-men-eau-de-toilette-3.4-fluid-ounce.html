            <li>good, worth the price</li>
            <li>I love this men&#x27;s fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is the high quality, great smelling cologne that you expect from Giorgio Armani.  </li>
            <li>The fakes are so good  and close to the real thing</li>
            <li>Plus the authentic stuff has a great smell and lasts for several hours.</li>
            <li>This is a genuine bottle of Gio that comes in the Gio box and its sealed with outer plastic.</li>
            <li>It has a hint similar but not like both Tommy Hilfiger and Clinique Happy.</li>
            <li>I enjoy it as well</li>
            <li>Shipped safely and was exactly as stated.</li>
            <li>but I doubt it&#x27;s original, responds well well with your comedito.</li>
            <li>This item was a great price and shipped sooner than expected.</li>
            <li>smells good but doesn&#x27;t last any length of time.</li>
            <li>and I expect a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t ask for a review if you can&#x27;t handle the truth.</li>
            <li>Hubby loved this for his Christmas present as stocking stuffer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad smell</li>
            <li>The price was right and the packaging original.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t call this high quality, I believe the designer could do better.</li>
            <li>thanks!!</li>
            <li>I did buy back up colonge Adam Laveen which smells amazing.</li>
            <li>The shipping was super fast as well!</li>
            <li>The scent when you spray it on you doesn&#x27;t really smell great until it stays on your body too long, that&#x27;s when you smell the real scent.</li>
            <li>The size is pretty good and it last for a long time for sure but the smell and scent is something that bothers me.</li>
            <li>It comes in the right bottle and everything but smells nothing like the real thing!</li>
            <li>Thanks for saving me over $100!</li>
            <li>When I first I got it, I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell until I started getting used to it.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>so I can test it first.</li>
            <li>As have many female strangers.</li>
            <li>I gave the first bottle to him quite some time ago</li>
            <li>and he absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>Love this scent immensely.</li>
            <li>I highly reccommend them!!</li>
            <li>Item just as presented and fast delivery!</li>
            <li>Was delivered right on time and product was high quality!</li>
            <li>I just received my bottle today, and it is absolutely authentic, I&#x27;ve been wearing this cologne for years and it is absolutely the same bottle you buy at Macy&#x27;s or Dillards but cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I have used Giorgio Armani Acqua Di for several years and upon receiving this today and opening it, I really noticed a strong rubbing alcohol type odor coming from the box and the bottle.</li>
            <li>just as described, very quick shipping, saved so much money vs. buying it at my local store!!</li>
            <li>Also I would suggest that you shouldn&#x27;t spray too much because it makes you to sneeze a lot and the scent is strong so like four to five sprays is really enough, trust me.</li>
            <li>It is a classic!</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars cause of the price and how fast I received it and</li>
            <li>I was very displeased.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>I would really get this again.</li>
            <li>Packaged very well and was delivered very timely.</li>
            <li>Mine arrived it was the real deal.</li>
            <li>Its a nice product its very subtle and light</li>
            <li>The Fake bottle has a matte finish to the printed letters but the Real bottle&#x27;s letters have a bright shine when held at the right angle.</li>
            <li>A classic.</li>
            <li>but I will for sure spend the extra money and buy it in a store next time.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Thank You, no hard feelings.</li>
            <li>be scared because at least the bottle I got was 100% authentic Giorgio Armani.</li>
            <li>I sprayed a little on me and it had a strong aroma like rubbing alcohol or something similar to that.  </li>
            <li>You barely need to use any to make it work.</li>
            <li>Its  popular cologne and cant go wrong with it.</li>
            <li>I have purchased Giorgio Armani Acqua Di Gio several times over the years in between other new fragrances.</li>

            <li> The fragrance didn&#x27;t last long throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> This stuff did not last very long.</li>
            <li> I got it earlier than expected.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell the same as my previous store bought bottle of the same scent.</li>
            <li> husband has tried other brands but we keep coming back to this</li>
            <li> I agree with some of the reviews that say the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long and that its a little different than the ones that are store bought.</li>
            <li> it is tough to tell, but on the product I received there is no printed text on the inside like there is on the real thing.</li>
            <li> Total waste</li>
            <li> (so does my other half)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband had bought the size down from this for $71 at Sephora</li>
            <li> was a little worried with some of the negative feed back about fakes.</li>
            <li> YET half the price.</li>
            <li> I was a little bit scared to order this item because of the reviews saying it was a non-authentic product.</li>
            <li> All of my past lovers seem to prefer it over other brands.</li>
            <li> Though this is for men, I use a little often</li>
            <li> there was no smell waste of money.</li>
            <li> This product is complete fake</li>
            <li> Once you spray it on, you even cannot smell the scent for few minutes.</li>
            <li> It was not a genuine product....</li>
            <li> well we got this one for less than $60!</li>
            <li> I never get tired of it like other colognes.</li>
            <li> The product I received is a FAKE, not genuine.  </li>
            <li> It was soooooo weak.</li>
            <li> Product is very weak.</li>
            <li> I am uncertain if this is a fake knock off or what it is.</li>
            <li> I was one of the unfortunate ones who received a fake</li>
            <li> Either they changed the formula or this is a fake.</li>
            <li> This cologne is a fake.</li>
            <li> I think this is a FAKE Giorgio Armani product...</li>
            <li> I have received a fake copy of this cologne</li>
            <li> I must admit I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 100% real fake</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m disappointed in the scent change.</li>

            <li> smells good but doesn&#x27;t last any length of time.</li>
            <li> This cologne doesn&#x27;t smell like the one I buy from Macy&#x27;s...... there was no smell waste of money. I want to return it   If anyone has the info on how to return items please let me know that you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with my purchase smells great!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my son.  I is his very favorite fragrance, he has been wearing it for years!!</li>
            <li> I have used Giorgio Armani Acqua Di for several years and upon receiving this today and opening it, I really noticed a strong rubbing alcohol type odor coming from the box and the bottle. I sprayed a little on me and it had a strong aroma like rubbing alcohol or something similar to that.  Plus the authentic stuff has a great smell and lasts for several hours. This stuff did not last very long. I am uncertain if this is a fake knock off or what it is. I must admit I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> I read reviews on this and thought I would give it a try. Me personally I did not like the smell. It&#x27;s not a bad smell but I prefer something different and hoping once my boyfriend puts it on that I might like it on him if not he can wear it when he&#x27;s not with me. I did buy back up colonge Adam Laveen which smells amazing. I gave it 4 stars cause of the price and how fast I received it and in hopes once he puts it on I might like it.</li>
            <li> Perfect &amp; fast delivery</li>
            <li> My favorite scent for my husband!  The price was right and the packaging original.</li>
            <li> just as described, very quick shipping, saved so much money vs. buying it at my local store!! thanks!!</li>
            <li> Great smell.  My Wife loves it !!!</li>
            <li> Great Product, As described, Fast Shipping, Will buy from again!</li>
            <li> Smells great!  Lasts all day too, even if you sweat.  You barely need to use any to make it work.</li>
            <li> Excellent aroma for a man.</li>
            <li> Have been wearing this cologne for about 10 years now... LOVE IT (so does my other half)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies: If you&#x27;re unsure of a cologne for your boyfriend/husband, etc., then you found the winner here!</li>
            <li> I have purchased Giorgio Armani Acqua Di Gio several times over the years in between other new fragrances. Each time I buy Acqua Di Gio I remember what a great mens fragrance it is. It is a classic!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this scent and he was very pleased.</li>
            <li> Do not buy! It&#x27;s 100% real fake</li>
            <li> Absolutely perfect.  Thanks for saving me over $100!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call this high quality, I believe the designer could do better. The size is pretty good and it last for a long time for sure but the smell and scent is something that bothers me. When I first I got it, I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell until I started getting used to it. The scent when you spray it on you doesn&#x27;t really smell great until it stays on your body too long, that&#x27;s when you smell the real scent. Also I would suggest that you shouldn&#x27;t spray too much because it makes you to sneeze a lot and the scent is strong so like four to five sprays is really enough, trust me.</li>
            <li> Very good quality product. Excellent presentation shipping</li>
            <li> Great price for a GREAT smelling cologne</li>
            <li> i love this cologne and have never ordered cologne online before, but i saw the offer and the price was so good that i gave it a shot. i received the cologne in a timely fashion and was pleased to see that it smelled great! thanks!</li>
            <li> Satisfied with the product and the delivery . Will recommend</li>
            <li> This product is complete fake</li>
            <li> This is the high quality, great smelling cologne that you expect from Giorgio Armani.  Love the Gio smell.  This is a genuine bottle of Gio that comes in the Gio box and its sealed with outer plastic.</li>
            <li> Product isn&#x27;t genuine and is a knock off! Do not buy from this storefront.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell the same as my previous store bought bottle of the same scent. Great shipping speed but I&#x27;m disappointed in the scent change.</li>
            <li> A classic. Shipped safely and was exactly as stated.</li>
            <li> nice product! love it.</li>
            <li> Perfect. As described.</li>
            <li> Love love love Acqua Di Gio....</li>
            <li> The bottle is huge!!!! My husband had bought the size down from this for $71 at Sephora well we got this one for less than $60! And it&#x27;s 3X bigger!</li>
            <li> Smells great and my girlfriend loves it!</li>
            <li> Smells great not fake.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and great product!</li>
            <li> I was one of the unfortunate ones who received a fake and I knew it was because I have been wearing this for years but buy at the local mall for around 80. I tried a few squirts and knew instantly I hadn&#x27;t received a real one. I can always use two squirts a day regularly and it lasts a while but this one I had ordered, no. I put on about 5 squirts and within 15 minutes I couldn&#x27;t smell it. It was soooooo weak. I was very displeased. I will stick to the local mall to buy mine from now on.</li>
            <li> Been using this cologne for years and I can tell you, this bottle does NOT smell the same.  Either they changed the formula or this is a fake. Next time, I&#x27;ll be purchasing this in person so I can test it first. It&#x27;s still tolerable so bumped it from 1 to 2 stars.</li>
            <li> My ex wife bought me some of this many years ago and always loved it. All my partners since then have as well. As have many female strangers. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever had a woman say she didn&#x27;t like it unless it was that she did not like any colognes at all.</li>
            <li> This cologne is a fake. I&#x27;ve been wearing this product for more that 15 years, I&#x27;m returning this product and I expect a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t ask for a review if you can&#x27;t handle the truth. Thank You, no hard feelings. I will ship it out tomorrow. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Its a nice product its very subtle and light i probably will buy it again but in my opinion its not the BEST out there it lingers for a bit too which is nice</li>
            <li> Great !!! Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I just love this scent! I never get tired of it like other colognes. GREAT PRICE TOO!!</li>
            <li> This is one of my grandson&#x27;s favorite fragrances.  He loves it.  I gave the first bottle to him quite some time ago and he ran out.  This was a replacement.</li>
            <li> Smells good it&#x27;s legit.</li>
            <li> I think this is a FAKE Giorgio Armani product... Once you spray it on, you even cannot smell the scent for few minutes.</li>
            <li> There was no fragrance. I tossed it. Next purchase will be at Macy’s.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend of mine for his birthday and he absolutely loves it! Smells amazing! The shipping was super fast as well! I got it earlier than expected.  So happy with this purchase!!! Totally recommended!</li>
            <li> Just perfecr and smells great</li>
            <li> The product I received is a FAKE, not genuine.  Please inspect your packaging closely on the outside and the inside. The fakes are so good  and close to the real thing it is tough to tell, but on the product I received there is no printed text on the inside like there is on the real thing. Also, there is difference in the label printed on the bottle its self.  The Fake bottle has a matte finish to the printed letters but the Real bottle&#x27;s letters have a bright shine when held at the right angle.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells great. Hell, I&#x27;ll even spray it just because. It has a hint similar but not like both Tommy Hilfiger and Clinique Happy.</li>
            <li> Was delivered right on time and product was high quality!</li>
            <li> My husbands has worn this cologne for years- we both love it.</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell and not too overpowering if you use judiciously. I&#x27;d prefer if it didn&#x27;t have a spritzer, but I haven&#x27;t looked to see if it can be removed.</li>
            <li> Love this Cologne. I have been buying it for years!</li>
            <li> Product is very weak. It had been diluted at the factory...</li>
            <li> Hubby loved this for his Christmas present as stocking stuffer.  Love this scent immensely.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne, its a good deal for the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Great Product and Great Service. I Love It.</li>
            <li> The cologne came packaged well, was in excellent shape and my husband loves it! I would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> good cologne, smells good cheaper than department stores.</li>
            <li> This item was a great price and shipped sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Got this for my partner and instantly loved it. Its  popular cologne and cant go wrong with it. I would really get this again. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was a little bit scared to order this item because of the reviews saying it was a non-authentic product. I just received my bottle today, and it is absolutely authentic, I&#x27;ve been wearing this cologne for years and it is absolutely the same bottle you buy at Macy&#x27;s or Dillards but cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be scared because at least the bottle I got was 100% authentic Giorgio Armani.</li>
            <li> does the job but I doubt it&#x27;s original, responds well well with your comedito.</li>
            <li> love it. women love it. Im satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend you guys buy a bottle of this.&lt;br /&gt;you will not regret it!</li>
            <li> Only cologne I will use</li>
            <li> My son loves it and all the ladies just love to smell and be close to him no matter what their age. Lol</li>
            <li> I needed the package by Friday and got it two days before! This company went above and beyond my expectations. Couldn&#x27;t have asked for anything better. Great company..I highly reccommend them!!</li>
            <li> This great cologne. Packaged very well and was delivered very timely. I now smell good.</li>
            <li> Great price, great value and great smell as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband has tried other brands but we keep coming back to this scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Wife loves the smell and this bottle is 2X the size of a bottle from the stores YET half the price.</li>
            <li> For some reason this cologne has done well for me in terms of the opposite sex. All of my past lovers seem to prefer it over other brands. I enjoy it as well and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have received a fake copy of this cologne</li>
            <li> Item just as presented and fast delivery! Great transaction! Thank you</li>
            <li> It comes in the right bottle and everything but smells nothing like the real thing! Total waste if money! Don&#x27;t buy this</li>
            <li> Though this is for men, I use a little often</li>
            <li> great price smell good</li>
            <li> I agree with some of the reviews that say the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long and that its a little different than the ones that are store bought. It does have the scent but almost seems like it&#x27;s a knockoff in a ADG bottle or like it set around forever and lost its potency. I love the cologne but I will for sure spend the extra money and buy it in a store next time.</li>
            <li> The fragrance didn&#x27;t last long throughout the day. My wife wasn&#x27;t impressed. Said she couldn&#x27;t smell the fragrance. It did not meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> This smells like heaven on him. It&#x27;s like him in a bottle. Pretty good price for the best darn cologne my hubby wears.</li>
            <li> was a little worried with some of the negative feed back about fakes. Mine arrived it was the real deal. Great price and will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I love this cologne..... one of my favorite scents.....</li>
            <li> great scent; great product - one of my all time favorites</li>
            <li> This is a good fragrance . Not to over powering .</li>
            <li> Great fragrance.  Long lasting.</li>
            <li> I buy this as a gift and he loves its smells good, worth the price</li>
            <li> It was not a genuine product....</li>
            <li> I love this men&#x27;s fragrance. I have followed a man out of a store because of how amazing it smells. Lol</li>
