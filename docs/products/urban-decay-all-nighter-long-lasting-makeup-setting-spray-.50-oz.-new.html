    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Once you get your makeup perfect spritz it on and your set for the night.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;s great for keeping your makeup on all day and then not having to reapply to go out at night.  </li>
            <li>This product is great.</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>It was packaged up so nicely!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I honestly have heard so many good things about this product.</li>
            <li>lol, It works well under hot sun sweating and dancing!</li>
            <li>I love this makeup setting spray.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and will continue to  purchase it.</li>
            <li>It seems to work better on my under eye concealer than on my eye shadow staying power.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better when I&#x27;m not using the product.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.  </li>
            <li>Perfect if you will be sweating--I went out to dance, put my makeup on, sprayed a mist of this on my face, and my make up looked great 6 hours later despite me sweating the whole night</li>
            <li>I thought this product was ok.</li>
            <li>I also love pairing this spray their eye primer.</li>
            <li>This was okay.</li>
            <li>I decided to grab it for my wedding, and it did an okay job.</li>
            <li>Smell was okay, nothing too strong.</li>
            <li>It helps resist sweat and rain, and if I forget to wash my face before I go to bed, my makeup still looks pretty perfect the next day.  </li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t believe how quickly I received it after ordering!</li>
            <li>I assume this was a mistake on my part as I did not realize you pay $17 for a spray bottle that can fit in your pocket.</li>
            <li>For me, this was not such an amazing product, but hey, had to try it once!</li>
            <li>This is great for spending the night elsewear when you don&#x27;t want other people to see you without makeup.  </li>
            <li>But overall the shine was better than melted makeup :)</li>
            <li>It got me through a very, very hot summer.</li>
            <li>Not for everyday use, but great for special occasions.</li>
            <li>This is a great little tool to have when you are going out at night..</li>
            <li>I wish it would be cheaper other than that it is good, arrived quick</li>
            <li>It leaves a nice, dry, clean feeling on your face--not greasy like some.</li>
            <li>I thought that this might help my eyeshadow to last a bit longer, but honestly, I didn&#x27;t even notice a difference.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get a new bottle in time for my wedding  </li>
            <li>Only ok.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wedding, and I must say it does work pretty well.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive breakout-prone skin, and to say that my skin tolerated this is a pretty positive thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and yes I like it pretty much</li>
            <li>I was excited when I ordered this product especially after reading some of the positive reviews...</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference between the days I wore it and the days I didnt.</li>
            <li>Really takes care of my make-up melting issues in the summer.  </li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t tell if this stuff really works, so I rated it for the price.</li>
            <li>Too much money for one spray of this spray.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t stand the test of &amp;#34;tears&amp;#34; any better than any other setter I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and my foundation definitely fades during the day (I wear Bare Minerals), but when I use this I notice that everything stays on much better.</li>
            <li>Not as long lasting as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say this would last all night, and had I cried any more than I did, I&#x27;d probably give less than 3 stars, as it wasn&#x27;t superior to any other setter.</li>
            <li>No environment was too sticky or grungy for my new found make-up resilience powers!</li>
            <li>so far the spray has worked really well particularly to stop eyeshadow and blush from sliding (although it hasn&#x27;t really kept the colour from fading).</li>
            <li>My make-up does not &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; away and stays fresh the entire day.  </li>
            <li>While I haven&#x27;t had much opportunity to test it in really extreme heat (it&#x27;s been quite mild here this summer, and not too humid)</li>
            <li>That being said, for the price, you can find better and even the same strength of hold elsewhere for a lot less.</li>
            <li>This works unless youre going to be in the rain or whatever, so steer clear of water</li>
            <li>It really makes your make up last!</li>
            <li>I do limit using it to special occasions since my skin feels a little muddy afterwards, but it hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts.</li>
            <li>Kept my makeup on and noticed barely any smudging even during the pool days!</li>
            <li>It barely lasted a week or two</li>
            <li>My face is oily and I live in the Caribbean, and this product last helps me to keep my makeup for around 3 hours;  but without it my make up last around 1 to 2 hour(s)</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re a first-time user I would go with this small size instead of the pricier large; you don&#x27;t use much each time and it should last quite awhile.</li>
            <li>I have notes that my make up last the same the entire moring when I go to church or spend a whole day outside with a make up.</li>
            <li>Next time I&#x27;ll be buying directly from Urban Decay.</li>
            <li>During the winter I only need a spritz if I am having a long, busy day.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s extremely small, probably won&#x27;t last a week, and it looks half full.</li>
            <li> So I think is OK, I have to try it in a cold weather.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take long to get here</li>
            <li> If I could find a similar product for less, I would switch brands.  </li>
            <li> I thought the bottle would of been a little bigger</li>
            <li> Used this recently on a trip to Florida for a few concerts.</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff that sets my heavy gel &amp; liquid black eyeliner &amp; keeps it in place all day.</li>
            <li> not worth wasting your money on.</li>
            <li> I also like that it is a spray; you use much less of it than I would expect if it was a powder.</li>
            <li> Either way, a little oil comes through towards the end of the day.</li>
            <li> The downside is that it&#x27;s far too expensive.  </li>
            <li> I also wouldn&#x27;t buy the small travel-size bottle again.  </li>
            <li> The price was ridiculous for the amount of product I received.</li>
            <li> but thats on my poor judge of reading sizes</li>
            <li> I do not understand why it is so expensive.</li>
            <li> The product itself was alright, but the price point was horrible for the tiny bottle you get.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like that it does what it says  and the alcohol content is very low if any. I would recommed this product</li>
            <li> No environment was too sticky or grungy for my new found make-up resilience powers! Truly I was sitting in the back with the jack and the jukebox.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup setting spray.  It will keep my foundation, blush, and powder on essentially until I wash it off with makeup remover and face soap.  I&#x27;s great for keeping your makeup on all day and then not having to reapply to go out at night.  It helps resist sweat and rain, and if I forget to wash my face before I go to bed, my makeup still looks pretty perfect the next day.  This is great for spending the night elsewear when you don&#x27;t want other people to see you without makeup.  The downside is that it&#x27;s far too expensive.  If I could find a similar product for less, I would switch brands.  I also wouldn&#x27;t buy the small travel-size bottle again.  It barely lasted a week or two (I do my makeup every day).</li>
            <li> Love this product! I was so excited to get a new bottle in time for my wedding  and I couldn&#x27;t believe how quickly I received it after ordering!</li>
            <li> After I apply make-up, I spritz my face with setting spray and it WORKS!  My make-up does not &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; away and stays fresh the entire day.  I love this product and will continue to  purchase it.</li>
            <li> It seems to work better on my under eye concealer than on my eye shadow staying power. Not as long lasting as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> I wish it would be cheaper other than that it is good, arrived quick and yes I like it pretty much I have notes that my make up last the same the entire moring when I go to church or spend a whole day outside with a make up.</li>
            <li> I assume this was a mistake on my part as I did not realize you pay $17 for a spray bottle that can fit in your pocket. I do not understand why it is so expensive. I have not tried it yet but I hope it is the product I bought.  Next time I&#x27;ll be buying directly from Urban Decay.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference between the days I wore it and the days I didnt. Either way, a little oil comes through towards the end of the day.</li>
            <li> This product is great. It got me through a very, very hot summer. Kept my makeup on and noticed barely any smudging even during the pool days!</li>
            <li> I was excited when I ordered this product especially after reading some of the positive reviews...but it fell short for me, my makeup still became &#x27;muddy&#x27; after a day of work.  It&#x27;s better when I&#x27;m not using the product.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  It is like hairspray...for your face.  It isn&#x27;t oily or sticky, it just holds everything in place.  Perfect if you will be sweating--I went out to dance, put my makeup on, sprayed a mist of this on my face, and my make up looked great 6 hours later despite me sweating the whole night hah!  Id definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This works unless youre going to be in the rain or whatever, so steer clear of water</li>
            <li> The only con is i ran out!! I thought the bottle would of been a little bigger lol but thats on my poor judge of reading sizes lol, It works well under hot sun sweating and dancing!</li>
            <li> Used this recently on a trip to Florida for a few concerts. I definitely noticed my makeup lasted longer. That being said i would give it a 5 star but it did add some unwanted shine. But overall the shine was better than melted makeup :)</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff that sets my heavy gel &amp; liquid black eyeliner &amp; keeps it in place all day.</li>
            <li> Really takes care of my make-up melting issues in the summer.  My oily complexion is easier to maintain during the Chicago winters, but the summer is a challenge.  I use a primer and the spray in the summer faithfully.  During the winter I only need a spritz if I am having a long, busy day.</li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t had much opportunity to test it in really extreme heat (it&#x27;s been quite mild here this summer, and not too humid) so far the spray has worked really well particularly to stop eyeshadow and blush from sliding (although it hasn&#x27;t really kept the colour from fading). I also like that it is a spray; you use much less of it than I would expect if it was a powder.</li>
            <li> My face is oily and I live in the Caribbean, and this product last helps me to keep my makeup for around 3 hours;  but without it my make up last around 1 to 2 hour(s) (depending on the brand) because of my skin type. So I think is OK, I have to try it in a cold weather.</li>
            <li> I thought this product was ok. Only ok. The price was ridiculous for the amount of product I received. It was so tiny....so I won&#x27;t be re-purchasing it in the future. The product itself was alright, but the price point was horrible for the tiny bottle you get.</li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t tell if this stuff really works, so I rated it for the price. I&#x27;ll have to try it out again.</li>
            <li> This is a great little tool to have when you are going out at night.. Once you get your makeup perfect spritz it on and your set for the night. I also love pairing this spray their eye primer.</li>
            <li> This was okay. It didn&#x27;t stand the test of &amp;#34;tears&amp;#34; any better than any other setter I&#x27;ve used. I decided to grab it for my wedding, and it did an okay job. I wouldn&#x27;t say this would last all night, and had I cried any more than I did, I&#x27;d probably give less than 3 stars, as it wasn&#x27;t superior to any other setter. Smell was okay, nothing too strong. It leaves a nice, dry, clean feeling on your face--not greasy like some. That being said, for the price, you can find better and even the same strength of hold elsewhere for a lot less.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wedding, and I must say it does work pretty well. I have oily skin and my foundation definitely fades during the day (I wear Bare Minerals), but when I use this I notice that everything stays on much better. I&#x27;ve used this spray a couple times before going out at night, and it helps keep everything in place even when you&#x27;re dancing/sweating, etc. I do limit using it to special occasions since my skin feels a little muddy afterwards, but it hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts. I have super sensitive breakout-prone skin, and to say that my skin tolerated this is a pretty positive thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a first-time user I would go with this small size instead of the pricier large; you don&#x27;t use much each time and it should last quite awhile. Not for everyday use, but great for special occasions.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy this if you value your money. It&#x27;s extremely small, probably won&#x27;t last a week, and it looks half full. Too much money for one spray of this spray.</li>
            <li> I honestly have heard so many good things about this product. I thought that this might help my eyeshadow to last a bit longer, but honestly, I didn&#x27;t even notice a difference. For me, this was not such an amazing product, but hey, had to try it once!</li>
            <li> not even one ounce.  Sent in a domestic envelope from somebody named Angela. it was not sealed and I have no idea what is in this bottle.  I&#x27;ll just chalk this up as a lesson learned.  not worth wasting your money on. its like it was sent from someone&#x27;s basement.  no way am I spraying this anonymous stuff on my face!  then again it might be $15 I paid for water, I&#x27;ll never know!</li>
            <li> Ordered this as a gift for my sister. It was packaged up so nicely! It didn&#x27;t take long to get here and I have a friend in the makeup artist industry who swears by this stuff. It really makes your make up last!</li>
