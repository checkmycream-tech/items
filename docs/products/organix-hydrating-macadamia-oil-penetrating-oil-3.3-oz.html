            <li>A great product!</li>
            <li>I like the OGX Coconut Milk Anti Breakage Serum too, but the Macadamia Oil is the best.  </li>
            <li>This product is the best thing ever in life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Background:</li>

            <li>The Organix Macadamia Oil makes my hair look and feel very healthy!</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find this here for her!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipment</li>
            <li>I am not going to say it doesn&#x27;t moisturize the hair, but it does not smell that great</li>
            <li>The product is great.</li>
            <li>amazing oil , my hair seems so happy with it !</li>
            <li>I am happy to have found this product on Amazon...</li>
            <li>And it also smells great.</li>
            <li>Lol</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>good result on damp hair.</li>
            <li>Best of all, the oil is light and doesn&#x27;t stink forever.</li>
            <li>And it smells so good too.  </li>
            <li>and super shiny and perfect product for what i need it !</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>This stuff is AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>In the meantime, I need hair that functions day to day, and this stuff is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>My own hair tends to be frizzy and fly-away.</li>
            <li>It kind of smells candy like, but not like the pezz candy scent,</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>This is very light and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>Organix products are always either a hit or miss with me, but I really love this product.</li>
            <li>Love the product and will order again.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser says my my hair is so healthy since I started using this product.  </li>
            <li>This is my FAVORITE styling oil.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs deeply, my skin and hair are not oily, and yes, the smell is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I love that stuff, but it is pricey and my hair needs a lot of it.</li>
            <li>But, as I said, I&#x27;m glad to have found this product on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Additionally, my hair is a lot more manageable when using this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s okay, now, in the winter, but in the summer, I&#x27;d need more volume</li>
            <li>And the best thing is that its easy to fit into anything, so if you ever have dry hair, you can just get it out and apply it.</li>
            <li>It is easy to put in my hair and I can either blow it out or just leave it in my hair.</li>
            <li>Although it feels really good on my hands and feels good going on, once it dries on my hair it leaves my hair feeling very rough and even drier than it already was.</li>
            <li>I have fine, highlighted hair, but quite a bit of it.</li>
            <li>I touched it and it was smooth and glistening.</li>
            <li>You use just a dab of it, rub it between your palms, and lightly smooth over your hair after styling, or thread with your fingers through your hair to the roots before you style.</li>
            <li>Thanks to this Organix Styling Oil, I have a nice shine and bounce to my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light touch cares for the ends of my hair and my scalp, smells wonderful, and just plain feels</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap and seriously smells like a delicious candy :)</li>
            <li>to my surprise it was lightweight and the hair just kind of soaks it up, you literally cannot put too much of this in, i have tried just to test it out and see how far i could go with it, its just a nice light de-frizzing product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised this oil has so many good reviews because I really dislike it.</li>
            <li>It helps calm down all the fly aways and keeps my hair healthy</li>
            <li>very good product for re-hydrating dry hair , instant effect and has a nice smell.</li>
            <li>the past months of recovery, I use copious amounts of Potion 9 after shower because it&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve found for nourishing freshly washed hair</li>
            <li>By far the best beauty product I&#x27;ve found in a very long time!</li>
            <li>i have found that putting more in does not equal more frizz control,</li>
            <li>It smells great and does exactly what I was hoping: smooth down the crazies, softness, silkiness, sealing up the split ends.</li>
            <li>Some of the lighter oils might be good for blondes with really fine hair that might be weighed down with the heavier oils.</li>
            <li>I tried to style with it, and my hair was just dry and not so good looking.</li>
            <li>Love this product makes my hair feel soo soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>I have fine, colored hair and this product works very well for me.</li>
            <li>I find myself putting a very, very light coat over my make-up too, especially the powder blush to give it a sheen and smooth out lines in my face that powder can emphasize.</li>
            <li>I even got several compliments on how nice and shiney my hair looked when in actuality</li>
            <li>I just started using this oil for my naturally curly hair and it is FANTASTIC!  </li>
            <li>Meh...didn&#x27;t really see a difference when applying it to damp hair, works decently well on dry hair but mostly just smells good.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found this in stores, but I love it to help with frizz for my naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>i LOVE the smell of this, it&#x27;s about the same consistency as Biosilk oil if you&#x27;re familiar with that.</li>
            <li>I think you have to find the right oil for your hair type.  </li>
            <li>I found that, regardless of what product has already been applied, no matter what my hair has been through, I can always rely on this light, lovely smelling oil, to sooth my scalp and calm my dry hair.</li>
            <li>Having never bought any Organix products before, I&#x27;m super pleased with this and definitely plan on checking out the rest of the line.</li>
            <li>It absorbs easily without leaving residue (it doesn&#x27;t take much) and really helps the newer problems I have with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells good and keeps frizz down while also hydrating.</li>
            <li>but you can definitely smell it (not too strong, smells nice, actually)</li>
            <li>Not as thick as it originally was, but still good stuff.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair shiny and very soft!!!</li>
            <li>First let me say this-</li>
            <li>- Long, beautiful, thick, healthy hair almost to the waist in length.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other oils in the past--expensive and cheaper, and this is a nice mid-priced option.</li>
            <li>It is very hydrating for colored hair, smells good, and is not too heavy.</li>
            <li>I was going to buy a detangler, but thought a moisturizing oil would be a more pro-active approach to dry hair.</li>
            <li>I could smooth this product on after drying my hair (my hair has natural soft curls/waves and frizzes easily) and then flat iron the ends</li>
            <li>It also is very hydrating for your body and face.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price too..</li>
            <li>Much lighter than argan oil which means no &#x27;crunchy&#x27; hair</li>
            <li>This really is just an oil.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this will work for everyone, though, because even though it left my hair really soft and lovely, it didn&#x27;t de-volume it much.</li>
            <li>Did nothing for my hair and its very sticky too</li>
            <li>My beard is all greasy and manageable again, thanks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Argan oil, but it&#x27;s nice when you put it in, but later in the day, my hair feels dry.  </li>
            <li>Unlike most oils, I&#x27;ve found that this product does not weigh down my hair or make it oily at all.</li>
            <li>I have experimented with many hair oils because in my line of work I constantly need to have my hair pinned back.</li>
            <li>Took a while to arrive, but it is fine and as expected when it got here.</li>
            <li>The  boxes are a little beat up, but that&#x27;s not what gets used anyway.  :-)</li>
            <li>Who wants to smell like natural head oil.</li>
            <li>and since it&#x27;s so pricey decided to try something new.</li>
            <li>and it is so soft!</li>
            <li>The bottle&lt;br /&gt;itself had a light, glossy oil dripping down the sides.</li>
            <li>chief message is that I liked and used this product before becoming ill to condition my dry hair and it worked like a charm leaving no residue.</li>
            <li>I am able to use it on my hair daily without it weighing my hair down or giving it a greasy appearance.  </li>
            <li>I found that while using Organix hydrating macadamia penetrating oil on my hair, the psoriasis around my ears decreased, better than with medicated creams!  </li>
            <li>I have to go out and have that fly-away, banshee woman look about me, it is the only product to calm that storm enough to make me presentable.o make me presentable.</li>
            <li>I have very fine thin hair.</li>
            <li>but so light you can hardly smell it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When possible during this time with help I would use this product to care for my scalp, eliminate the frizzies, keep it from clumping together and becoming like dreadlocks, and at least give what was left of my hair some sense of control and shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>/&gt;Organix macadamia oil allows me to dry twist freely with very little shedding.</li>
            <li>I have long, really thick, course, Asian hair and lots of it and the Macadamia Styling Oil makes my hair feels soft and tangle free all day long.  </li>
            <li>I tried Amazon Prime for a month, for free shipping, but this and other products I usually buy are not Prime quailfied, so I discontinued  the Prime...</li>

            <li> while a bottle does last a long time, I just bought two as a way of stocking up!</li>

            <li> Maybe I would use this before a blow dry or something.  </li>
            <li> , what i was looking for in this products was a defrizzer/ smoothing product that held up through out the day and nourished my hair as well since alot of defrizzers use ingredients that can dry out the hair.</li>
            <li> when the hair is dry there is no residue, feels like there isn&#x27;t anything on the hair at all.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a more than a little sad that amazon is now the only place I can find this styling oil. I used to get it at target or Walmart and its no longer in stock now. This was the only product that I have found that I could use after styling my hair that would tame flyaways and frizz and add shine without leaving my hair feeling sticky or weighing it down. It feels silky in my hair. I even got several compliments on how nice and shiney my hair looked when in actuality I was in desperate need of a haircut and my ends were fried beyond belief. I could smooth this product on after drying my hair (my hair has natural soft curls/waves and frizzes easily) and then flat iron the ends and it would just shine. I&#x27;ve used frizz ease, bio-silk and other dry styling oils in the Organix line and was disappointed with them. I&#x27;m not saying those products are bad, but they all left my hair feeling &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; or sticky (even if I used a tiny bit) and it never stayed smooth. I guess it&#x27;s whatever works for your hair, and for me it&#x27;s this product.</li>
            <li> I have very fine thin hair. This product doesn&#x27;t make it look greasy at all. Makes my hair shiny and very soft!!!</li>
            <li> Best of the best oils</li>
            <li> Organix products are always either a hit or miss with me, but I really love this product. It smells good and keeps frizz down while also hydrating. And the best thing is that its easy to fit into anything, so if you ever have dry hair, you can just get it out and apply it.</li>
            <li> Love the product and will order again. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I tend to have dry, straw-like hair and this product immediately softens my hair and decreases frizz.  It&#x27;s amazing! I put it directly on my dry hair after I&#x27;ve styled it in the morning. It&#x27;s like night and day! By far the best beauty product I&#x27;ve found in a very long time!</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING.  My hairdresser says my my hair is so healthy since I started using this product.  It also is very hydrating for your body and face.</li>
            <li> My sister uses the macadamia oil and has said how hard it is to find.  I was so happy to find this here for her!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipment was prompt and product as described.  The  boxes are a little beat up, but that&#x27;s not what gets used anyway.  :-)</li>
            <li> I am used to Moroccan Oil, but I figured I would give this a try.  I found out that this product is heavy on my hair.  I am not going to say it doesn&#x27;t moisturize the hair, but it does not smell that great and it feels heavy and looks heavy on the hair.  Maybe I would use this before a blow dry or something.  Other than that, I am going back to MO.</li>
            <li> I was visiting my mother and saw this little brown bottle on her cosmetic shelf. mmmm . . . I thought . . . What is this? The bottle&lt;br /&gt;itself had a light, glossy oil dripping down the sides. I touched it and it was smooth and glistening. I read enough of the bottle to realize it was a hair product. My own hair tends to be frizzy and fly-away. I asked my Mom about it, and she told me my sister had recommended it to her (another family member with frizzy, fly-away hair). You use just a dab of it, rub it between your palms, and lightly smooth over your hair after styling, or thread with your fingers through your hair to the roots before you style. I find myself putting a very, very light coat over my make-up too, especially the powder blush to give it a sheen and smooth out lines in my face that powder can emphasize. A great product! I wish I&#x27;d known about it years ago.</li>
            <li> I have experimented with many hair oils because in my line of work I constantly need to have my hair pinned back. This hair oil protects, and smells heavenly.</li>
            <li> Love this product makes my hair feel soo soft and shiny! Reasonable price too..I would recommend this to friends and family</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised this oil has so many good reviews because I really dislike it. Although it feels really good on my hands and feels good going on, once it dries on my hair it leaves my hair feeling very rough and even drier than it already was. I believe it&#x27;s because this oil has artificial colors and PERFUME (alcohol, drying) in it! I know it&#x27;s at the end of the list of ingredients but you can definitely smell it (not too strong, smells nice, actually) and I feel like it definitely has an affect on my hair. Will not be buying this product again. I was really unhappy with how it made my hair feel. They should consider taking out the dyes and especially the fragrance!</li>
            <li> This is my FAVORITE styling oil.  I like the OGX Coconut Milk Anti Breakage Serum too, but the Macadamia Oil is the best.  I have long, really thick, course, Asian hair and lots of it and the Macadamia Styling Oil makes my hair feels soft and tangle free all day long.  I&#x27;ve tried Argan oil, but it&#x27;s nice when you put it in, but later in the day, my hair feels dry.  I think you have to find the right oil for your hair type.  Some of the lighter oils might be good for blondes with really fine hair that might be weighed down with the heavier oils.</li>
            <li> This product is the best thing ever in life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Background: I dry twist practically every night - not ideal since my hair hates manipulation. No matter what products I use to style and seal my ends with, I experience an inordinant amount of shedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organix macadamia oil allows me to dry twist freely with very little shedding. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, and pairs extremely well wtih nexus&#x27; hydra-light weightless moisture. Between these 2 products, i can typically go all day with moisturized defined twist-outs despite this TX humidity.</li>
            <li> I found that while using Organix hydrating macadamia penetrating oil on my hair, the psoriasis around my ears decreased, better than with medicated creams!  So I have also been using it on the rest of my body.  It absorbs deeply, my skin and hair are not oily, and yes, the smell is wonderful.  I have not found it in stock in stores after my initial find, which is sad.  They should rename it extreme body care.  The bottle in this section looks like the one I use, not the dry styling oil, which comes in a different bottle. (This is a bit confusing to me)</li>
            <li> I just started using this oil for my naturally curly hair and it is FANTASTIC!  Much lighter than argan oil which means no &#x27;crunchy&#x27; hair and you can never overdo it with this product.  I use it daily for softness and shine!</li>
            <li> Not as thick as it originally was, but still good stuff.</li>
            <li> This is very light and moisturizing.  I am able to use it on my hair daily without it weighing my hair down or giving it a greasy appearance.  I use it with other styling products that tend to dry out my hair to replenish moisture.</li>
            <li> The product is great.</li>
            <li> very good product for re-hydrating dry hair , instant effect and has a nice smell. good result on damp hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine, colored hair and this product works very well for me. It helps calm down all the fly aways and keeps my hair healthy</li>
            <li> amazing oil , my hair seems so happy with it ! and super shiny and perfect product for what i need it !</li>
            <li> hair type (thick and curly, long and dry) i was worried that this would be thick and heavy and weigh my hair down, what i was looking for in this products was a defrizzer/ smoothing product that held up through out the day and nourished my hair as well since alot of defrizzers use ingredients that can dry out the hair. to my surprise it was lightweight and the hair just kind of soaks it up, you literally cannot put too much of this in, i have tried just to test it out and see how far i could go with it, its just a nice light de-frizzing product. i have found that putting more in does not equal more frizz control, when the hair is dry there is no residue, feels like there isn&#x27;t anything on the hair at all. it does however not enhance shine, not sure if its just me. overall i&#x27;d say the pro&#x27;s outweigh the cons.</li>
            <li> It is easy to put in my hair and I can either blow it out or just leave it in my hair. My hair is soft and smells wonderful. Plus it is not greasey</li>
            <li> Does wonderful things for my hair. I put it in when my hair is about halfway dry and it moisturizes so well.</li>
            <li> this side of Macadamia Healing Oil Treatment. I love that stuff, but it is pricey and my hair needs a lot of it. I was hoping this would be a comparable product and it is. It smells great and does exactly what I was hoping: smooth down the crazies, softness, silkiness, sealing up the split ends. Having never bought any Organix products before, I&#x27;m super pleased with this and definitely plan on checking out the rest of the line.</li>
            <li> I use this when grooming my dog. It helps in keeping the long hair tame in the winter. I am careful about using this product in places where my dog might lick, as it contains macadamia nut oil. The product is inexpensive compared to other dog grooming oils that I have purchased.</li>
            <li> I am happy to have found this product on Amazon...I cannot find it in any of the local stores so I bought three to have enough for a while (hopefully organix does not discontinue the macadamia oil dry styling oil). Took a while to arrive, but it is fine and as expected when it got here. I tried Amazon Prime for a month, for free shipping, but this and other products I usually buy are not Prime quailfied, so I discontinued  the Prime...I&#x27;m not a big shopper. But, as I said, I&#x27;m glad to have found this product on Amazon. It is very hydrating for colored hair, smells good, and is not too heavy.</li>
            <li> I am an African American female with natural thick, curly hair. The Organix Macadamia Oil makes my hair look and feel very healthy! Unlike most oils, I&#x27;ve found that this product does not weigh down my hair or make it oily at all. Additionally, my hair is a lot more manageable when using this product. Thanks to this Organix Styling Oil, I have a nice shine and bounce to my hair. I love it. 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I tried to style with it, and my hair was just dry and not so good looking. But then I just let it air dry and it is so soft! Best of all, the oil is light and doesn&#x27;t stink forever. It kind of smells candy like, but not like the pezz candy scent, whatever fake sugar smell that is. It&#x27;s like real hard candy scent but so light you can hardly smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s my pet peeve: smell and absorption. There seems to be some cones it but not a whole lot. Not like the other organix serums. This really is just an oil. I don&#x27;t think this will work for everyone, though, because even though it left my hair really soft and lovely, it didn&#x27;t de-volume it much. That&#x27;s okay, now, in the winter, but in the summer, I&#x27;d need more volume control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look, idiots, it&#x27;s not gonna work for everyone. God, what a bunch of idiots.</li>
            <li> My hair tends to get puffy 5 hours after washing it. I have this oil to prevent that and it does the job. And it also smells great. I&#x27;m a man but my wife loves to smell my hair. Who wants to smell like natural head oil. Disgusting! Lol</li>
            <li> i LOVE the smell of this, it&#x27;s about the same consistency as Biosilk oil if you&#x27;re familiar with that. I used to use biosilk daily but ran out and since it&#x27;s so pricey decided to try something new. My hair is very long but also really thin, kinda stringy at the bottom because I&#x27;ve had damage from coloring it, so I have some split ends and this causes frequent tangling. I was going to buy a detangler, but thought a moisturizing oil would be a more pro-active approach to dry hair. I think this oil works well to provide immediate moisture (no idea if it&#x27;s providing long term improvements) and I can tell a difference in the amount of tangles my hair gets after applying this. I would recommend! It&#x27;s cheap and seriously smells like a delicious candy :)</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my hair and its very sticky too</li>
            <li> Meh...didn&#x27;t really see a difference when applying it to damp hair, works decently well on dry hair but mostly just smells good.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair shiny and manageable  without making it heavy.  And it smells so good too.  I use it everyday</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found this in stores, but I love it to help with frizz for my naturally curly hair.  It seems lighter to me than moroccan oil, and I prefer this.</li>
            <li> My beard is all greasy and manageable again, thanks. &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! Use it on damp hair, then dry... just the right amount doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or make it look/feel icky. My hair (thin and colored) loves this product... Once my hair is dry - then I style it and then put just a little bit on my palms to rub down the ends... it&#x27;s wonderful, and smells great too!</li>
            <li> This is a terrific product for several reasons. I found that, regardless of what product has already been applied, no matter what my hair has been through, I can always rely on this light, lovely smelling oil, to sooth my scalp and calm my dry hair. It absorbs easily without leaving residue (it doesn&#x27;t take much) and really helps the newer problems I have with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In recent months some serious health problems have destroyed what had always been my claim to fame - Long, beautiful, thick, healthy hair almost to the waist in length. Over half of my hair fell leaving just wiry little straggles stopping at my shoulders. What remained was frizzy, weak, and sickly looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not able to wash my hair initially at all then later only twice a week. When possible during this time with help I would use this product to care for my scalp, eliminate the frizzies, keep it from clumping together and becoming like dreadlocks, and at least give what was left of my hair some sense of control and shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the past months of recovery, I use copious amounts of Potion 9 after shower because it&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve found for nourishing freshly washed hair and then this product during the day and each evening. No frizzies. No more breakage. The hair is growing back. All is well with the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chief message is that I liked and used this product before becoming ill to condition my dry hair and it worked like a charm leaving no residue. Through my illness and ongoing recovery it is a hair care staple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I haven&#x27;t found any other product on the market quite like it I fear they will stop making it, so while a bottle does last a long time, I just bought two as a way of stocking up! It&#x27;s light touch cares for the ends of my hair and my scalp, smells wonderful, and just plain feels good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I have to go out and have that fly-away, banshee woman look about me, it is the only product to calm that storm enough to make me presentable.o make me presentable.</li>
            <li> First let me say this- my hair is incredibly long at the moment and I am well past the point of needing a big chop. I have fine, highlighted hair, but quite a bit of it. I&#x27;ve been working on growing out my natural color, which is a dirty blonde, and am planning on getting a &amp;#34;long bob&amp;#34; soon, with some balayage. In the meantime, I need hair that functions day to day, and this stuff is AMAZING. It actually soaks into my hair, and I&#x27;ve just been amazed at the taming of my hair, the softness, and the overall ease I&#x27;ve gotten with this product. I will definitely repurchase! I&#x27;ve used other oils in the past--expensive and cheaper, and this is a nice mid-priced option. I&#x27;m also considering the coconut milk by the same brand.</li>
