            <li>I have used the shampoo more than once, just to see if it was just that one time</li>
            <li>The condition was much better....</li>
            <li>I purchased Silicon Mix Hair treatment and  shampoo for my granddaughters they love conditioning</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>The conditioner is amazing and makes my hair feel so smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t say for sure that it had something to do with the silicon mix or not.</li>
            <li>but there are better dominican products out there.</li>
            <li>Love using this product in combination with the Brazilian Hair Treatment.</li>
            <li>Make sure you rinse out the conditioner though.</li>
            <li>I am Hispanic and over the years of hair dyes I was hoping to find a product to make my hair healthy again..</li>

            <li>but this price was great and the product is real.</li>
            <li>Bambu version is better.</li>
            <li>After leaving the conditioner in for about an hour, the hair is smooth as silk!</li>

            <li>hair is very light and easy to manage with just these two products.  </li>
            <li>i know silicones arent good for your hair and this is exactly what this is.</li>
            <li>It makes my extensions feel pretty good.</li>
            <li>I thought it was because my hair was too damaged to get that beautiful bouncy natural curl anymore.</li>
            <li>Good quantity enough for me &amp; my daughter to share at a reasonable price was perfect for my household</li>
            <li>glad I found these products great for going natural</li>
            <li>I will order more, my life as a relaxer free women just got better.</li>
            <li>it really works great conditioner and shampoo to get your hair clean</li>
            <li>Wife loved it, it really works well</li>
            <li>My hair has never been so easy to comb and manage.</li>
            <li>Smells strong but works well</li>
            <li>My hair is so much better looking and feels soft and the beautiful natural shine that it leaves on my hair is just amazing.</li>
            <li>I have a closet full of hair products that do not compare to Silicon Mix, and priced at $35 or  more</li>
            <li>Smell so good and my hair is very soft</li>
            <li>She recomends as a good  treatment that makes the hair very soft</li>
            <li>After a fresh trim these products will keep hair strong and healthy.</li>
            <li>I purchased the original and it has a really strong smell.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair silky smooth &amp; has such a great aroma</li>
            <li>left my brazillian hair smooth and revived great product will defelenty buy again</li>
            <li>The package was wrap securely so the shampoo and conditioner will not spill while it was being shipped.</li>
            <li>I stopped dying my hair and began trimming it...and was hoping to find a great deep conditioner but for some reason it didn&#x27;t work for me..</li>
            <li>and it was smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>My hair has been frizz free since I started using this product.  </li>
            <li>The actual product is great.</li>
            <li>This works great for bringing life to my human hair extensions.</li>
            <li>Great protects it is actually</li>
            <li>It made her hair nice soft and defined her curls even more.</li>
            <li>This Stuff works good on your permed, natural and transitioning hair.</li>
            <li>I have to give this a mid rating because it was my fault this didn&#x27;t work for me, but I am sure this is a good product.</li>
            <li>By itself, it&#x27;s a good conditioner, but I mix it with the Crecepelo Tratamiento Fitoterapeutico Natural conditioner and my hair</li>
            <li>Love love love,makes hair feel really soft!!!</li>
            <li>i know people say that the smell is strong nd smells like medication but to me it smells like baby powder stuff which is cool</li>
            <li>My first time buying this and its great so far.</li>
            <li>I have a full head of fine, curly hair.</li>
            <li>It makes the hair so soft and easy to comb, the shine in my hair is amazing.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time and fell in love...</li>
            <li>I saw these product on YouTube and got excited..</li>
            <li>I was definitely NOT disappointed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny!  </li>
            <li>and I love them already after the first use.</li>
            <li>I love the Silicon Mix Treatment so much that I got my daughter to use it, and then she liked it so much she used it on her daughters hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get my hair as clean as I would like.&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li>the shampoo doesn’t clean that well, it leads to a lot of buildup from the silicone that coats the shaft</li>
            <li>Best stuff to bring natural or weaves back to life!!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing for my natural hair and my weave too!</li>
            <li>This product is pretty good and it made my hair very soft n silky</li>
            <li>This stuff wasn&#x27;t all that special to me.</li>
            <li>I used this product to wash unprocessed Brazilian hair and it worked great.</li>
            <li>Although this product may be nice on extensions, I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using it on natural hair.</li>
            <li>I loved the way it left my hair feeling silky</li>
            <li>It makes my hair very manageable and I love the smell.</li>
            <li>Curly, wavy or straight, this stuff adds shine and makes the hair look as good as new.</li>
            <li>Makes my natural hair really strong and healthy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great on weave, it comes right back to life ;)</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and this shampoo and conditioner is great for virgin hair it can bring any hair back to life</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff, now if only it smelled better.</li>
            <li>Love it this product breathes new life into hair and hair extensions.</li>
            <li>This is the first product  I&#x27;ve found to help untangle her hair!</li>
            <li>Overall I love this combo, it is now my go to wash and conditioner!</li>
            <li>And as far as my raggedy, beaten to pieces weave, it&#x27;s good as new as well.</li>
            <li>Love this product, it makes my hair so soft and super curly.</li>
            <li>The Shampoo is fine, but what you really want is the conditioner.</li>
            <li>It is shiny, smells amazing, and looks like I just left the Dominican Hair Salon!</li>
            <li>I used the conditioner on a curly weave and also on my own wavy hair as a deep conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Recommended by my hairstylist, and I love the way it makes my hair feel so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>But for this price, it&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
            <li>This product had my hair feeling like it was fresh out the package</li>
            <li>Overall, the conditioner is nice the but shampoo is &amp;#34;uneventful.</li>
            <li>Used it on my own hair, same thing.</li>
            <li>Hair is swagin&#x27;, fresh, unmatted, with no tangles.</li>
            <li>Crece Pelo, silicon mix original, silicon mix bambu and my ultimate favorite alter ego garlic mask.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li>right away I ordered the kanechom (krite) and silicon mix</li>
            <li>really gets your hair clean</li>
            <li>it smells amazing and leaves your natural hair / weave extensions feeling like new again</li>
            <li>My hair was soft and easy to detangle.</li>
            <li>I love lasting fragrance and fresh look.</li>
            <li>And the softness and pleasant smell stays in until I wash my hair a few days</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>Came very fast.</li>
            <li>I like this product very much,  </li>
            <li>thanks amazon!</li>
            <li>Although the product came fast it came spilled!</li>
            <li>Also if you have the most tangled extensions ever this will revive any human hair extension.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Conditioner worked better, but that scent it too much for me to bare.</li>
            <li>thanks for everything!</li>
            <li>The first application I washed my hair and applied conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have to say that I was a sceptic at first but after trying the Silicon combo</li>
            <li>It turned out so soft manageable and tangle free</li>
            <li>it was at when I first bought it.  </li>
            <li>Works pretty well, cant stand the smell of this product.</li>
            <li>I love the shampoo and deep conditioner treatment.</li>
            <li>it was kind of knotted a little bit, but when I used the shampoo and conditioner together it came out super silky soft and smooth</li>
            <li>my bundles of hair looked great afterwords BUT BE CAREFUL it will turn your wefts white if you get the product on the wefts...</li>
            <li>I also used it as a deep conditioner for my own hair and it made it really soft.</li>
            <li>The shampoo didn&#x27;t do much, maybe because it&#x27;s my first use</li>
            <li>It smells very strong, but I don&#x27;t really feel that it did the job I expected it to do.  </li>
            <li>This time I let air dry, and was surprised that my beautiful curls were back.</li>
            <li>it may my hair super soft  </li>
            <li>Its a bit strong for me personally but maybe not for anyone else.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stink necessarily, but the smell was so strong</li>
            <li>, however, I finally decided to add more conditioner and worked it in to loosen the matting and it worked very well (as the hair, at first, was a mess that I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be able to wear again).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but i still love the product my hair instantly becomes soft and pretty after applying the conditioner</li>
            <li>and I lost a lot of hair after conditioning (could have been my own fault and the fact that it was the tight curls)</li>
            <li>this is a very highly reccommended product, it you havent used it yet, try it.</li>
            <li>They really give my hair the moisture that it needs and</li>
            <li>but this is a REAL woman who buys literally everything off of amazon n</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>It also does really well for my sew in.</li>
            <li>It tamed the frizz on curly hair and really brought out the curl pattern on textured non relaxed hair.  </li>
            <li>I heard sooo much stuff about these products via youtube.</li>
            <li>it was too much ..</li>
            <li>My ends look healthier when my hair is straight.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the product</li>
            <li>I do not use this on my real hair.</li>
            <li>and it turned out much</li>
            <li>For some reason, I gave it another try on my real hair</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Fast shipping..</li>
            <li>very hydrating.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I really like this item</li>
            <li>I will be ordering them again very soon.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Real Works</li>
            <li>I literally just got out of the shower and ran straight to my laptop to leave this review...</li>
            <li>The silicon mix is very hydrating</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It definitely leaves your hair soft after using it, but I did notice my curls loosen, then eventually my hair was more wavy than curly.</li>
            <li>I felt the shampoo kind of dried my hair (weave)</li>
            <li>, I use it on my natural hair and my Brazilian hair, but I must say it works wonders on my Brazilian hair, will always buy and especially from this seller because I love the price.</li>
            <li>Depends on how frizzy, dry, or tangled the hair is becoming.</li>
            <li>and my hair smelled lik the product for like 4 days despite being outside and doing normal things which was fine with me because people thought i had perfume on</li>
            <li>I know that it work much better for other people...</li>
            <li>I have fine long hair that I have been coloring and bleaching for the summer.</li>
            <li>The shampoo gets hair squeeky clean, and then the conditioner puts the moisture back in the hair on contact.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair pretty soft and shiny...but that smell tho....</li>
            <li>There was no need to use additional products to get the smooth look I seek to achieve with multiple products so frequently.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair very soft!</li>
            <li>This stuff right here was definitely a weave saver I was so ready to toss my weave in the trash until this stuff</li>
            <li>as well I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>The smell gives an extra boost for me, my hair smells like a fresh spring day.</li>
            <li>Left my hair with a build up feeling right after using it.</li>
            <li>This picture is from May with my hair freshly washed and flat ironed (no relaxer).</li>
            <li>Made my hair very soft and pliable just as promised.</li>
            <li>It made my weave very soft ..</li>
            <li>Not only did this product come very fast</li>
            <li>Works miracle on natural hair and weave!</li>
            <li>My hair comes out looking alive and very soft.</li>
            <li>it is even better than when I first bought it, seriously!</li>
            <li>Very trust worthy product, no residue, or heavy feeling in the hair.</li>
            <li>but it actually smells quite fresh and clean and the smell usually fades within a day.</li>
            <li>I use it on my virgin weave and my natural hair and it leaves both with a natural shine,smooth, and soft.</li>
            <li>it smells like Old Lady perfume  </li>
            <li>I have type 4 natural hair</li>
            <li>The product made my hair soft and manageable but it did not perform the &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; on reviving the Peruvian Hair Bundles that I purchased it for.</li>
            <li>so far works just as stated</li>
            <li>But the smell is extremely loud to the point</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using on your natural hair ..</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t like the shampoo on my natural hair</li>
            <li>it was very drying but for my weave definitely a repurchase</li>
            <li>but this moisturizes it completely.</li>
            <li>I use this comb for my hair extensions and leaves is soft and gives it lots of shine.</li>
            <li>a clear indication that the natural oils had been stripped...</li>
            <li>Tried this on 4 different types of hair (Malaysian, Peruvian Straight, Peruvian Body Wave, Brazilian Body Wave).</li>
            <li>friend recommended this product to me, she has coarse hair, very unlike mine</li>
            <li>My hair always feels so soft and hydrated after I use this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;Makes hair soft and manageable without weighing it down.&lt;br /&gt;Smells</li>
            <li>I got this because a beauty shop owner told me that she uses them both on all her client&#x27;s hair, natural and relaxed.</li>
            <li>I wanted to restore the hair for shine, dryness, and to return to its natural body wave.</li>
            <li>Products leave my natural hair shine and sort to touch  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural 4a.</li>
            <li>Im Caucasian, with naturally curly hair - shoulder length.</li>
            <li>I used it once and my hair was so freaking soft and shiny</li>
            <li>After shampooing and using the deep conditioner, my hair feels very shiny and bouncy again.  </li>
            <li>whatever u want 2 call it any hair that needs hydration ending results soft an silky hair from the silicon treatment.</li>
            <li>I also tried them on my natural hair</li>
            <li>I purchased some weave that I was ready to send back</li>
            <li>I have yet to try it on my natural hair.</li>
            <li>it made my hair soft.</li>
            <li>I received the products today (a day early) and tried them out</li>
            <li>It made my natural hair soft</li>
            <li>It make your hair so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I have a weave and use it on my weave and natural leave out once a week so far</li>
            <li>This brings virgin hair back to life it really works would buy again soon</li>
            <li>These products leave my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Used it, big mistake, the hair looked nice immediately after the wash, but once it started  drying, it looked like a big messy hair ball.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair feels so soft after washing my remy human hair, my curls snapped right back.</li>
            <li>Whipped my super dry, tangled, and matted weave back in to shape.</li>
            <li>The shampoo left my hair super dry</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t spend this much on hair products, but this product is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>is a video on it ,  [...] , it makes my hair really soft, no regrets</li>
            <li>the smell was cool at first but the more you use it starts to get annoying</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure whether this is genuine or not, but I bought this because I saw some youtube videos that claim it to repair humain hair bought on Aliexpress.  </li>
            <li>This product took care of all that and left my hair looking and feeling new.</li>
            <li>I have thick naturally curly hair and its such a pain when I wash my hair because it easily tangles.</li>
            <li>This product brings life back to old hair extensions.</li>
            <li>The hair is back to being soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I researched this product on U-Tube and it has exceeded all my expectations - I currently have a sew in and it makes your hair so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>only this made my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>(I am 9 months pregnant, so my senses may be a little off!</li>
            <li>Over the years my hair has become brittle and coarse due to consistent coloring and age.</li>
            <li>My natural (African American)</li>
            <li>The only thing is: don&#x60;t wash your hair with this more than once a week, because it makes the hair a little heavy.</li>
            <li>But then when dry, I don&#x27;t feel like it really helped in the long term.</li>
            <li>Let me start off by saying that I have very VERY coarse hair and could barely put a comb through my hair with out it getting stuck.</li>
            <li>Brought my dry looking Brazilian weave hair back to a natural shine and bounceness!</li>
            <li>I bought these a while back and did work well for thicker hair, mine is on the fine side so it weighed it down and was too heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li>My dry and tangled Indian Remy hair went back to the soft manageable state</li>

            <li> I purchased Silicon Mix Hair treatment and  shampoo for my granddaughters they love conditioning</li>

            <li> The conditioner is amazing and makes my hair feel so smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t say for sure that it had something to do with the silicon mix or not.</li>
            <li> but there are better dominican products out there.</li>
            <li> Love using this product in combination with the Brazilian Hair Treatment.</li>
            <li> Make sure you rinse out the conditioner though.</li>
            <li> I am Hispanic and over the years of hair dyes I was hoping to find a product to make my hair healthy again..</li>

            <li> It makes my extensions feel pretty good.</li>
            <li> I thought it was because my hair was too damaged to get that beautiful bouncy natural curl anymore.</li>

            <li> I stopped dying my hair and began trimming it...and was hoping to find a great deep conditioner but for some reason it didn&#x27;t work for me..</li>
            <li> and it was smooth and silky.</li>

            <li> I have to give this a mid rating because it was my fault this didn&#x27;t work for me, but I am sure this is a good product.</li>
            <li> By itself, it&#x27;s a good conditioner, but I mix it with the Crecepelo Tratamiento Fitoterapeutico Natural conditioner and my hair</li>
            <li> Love love love,makes hair feel really soft!!!</li>
            <li> i know people say that the smell is strong nd smells like medication but to me it smells like baby powder stuff which is cool</li>

            <li> I used it for the first time and fell in love...</li>
            <li> I saw these product on YouTube and got excited..</li>
            <li> I was definitely NOT disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny!  </li>
            <li> and I love them already after the first use.</li>
            <li> I love the Silicon Mix Treatment so much that I got my daughter to use it, and then she liked it so much she used it on her daughters hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get my hair as clean as I would like.&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li> the shampoo doesn’t clean that well, it leads to a lot of buildup from the silicone that coats the shaft</li>
            <li> Best stuff to bring natural or weaves back to life!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing for my natural hair and my weave too!</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good and it made my hair very soft n silky</li>
            <li> This stuff wasn&#x27;t all that special to me.</li>
            <li> I used this product to wash unprocessed Brazilian hair and it worked great.</li>
            <li> Although this product may be nice on extensions, I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using it on natural hair.</li>
            <li> I loved the way it left my hair feeling silky</li>
            <li> It makes my hair very manageable and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> Curly, wavy or straight, this stuff adds shine and makes the hair look as good as new.</li>
            <li> Makes my natural hair really strong and healthy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great on weave, it comes right back to life ;)</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and this shampoo and conditioner is great for virgin hair it can bring any hair back to life</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff, now if only it smelled better.</li>
            <li> Love it this product breathes new life into hair and hair extensions.</li>
            <li> This is the first product  I&#x27;ve found to help untangle her hair!</li>
            <li> Overall I love this combo, it is now my go to wash and conditioner!</li>
            <li> And as far as my raggedy, beaten to pieces weave, it&#x27;s good as new as well.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it makes my hair so soft and super curly.</li>
            <li> The Shampoo is fine, but what you really want is the conditioner.</li>
            <li> It is shiny, smells amazing, and looks like I just left the Dominican Hair Salon!</li>
            <li> I used the conditioner on a curly weave and also on my own wavy hair as a deep conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Recommended by my hairstylist, and I love the way it makes my hair feel so soft and silky.</li>
            <li> But for this price, it&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
            <li> This product had my hair feeling like it was fresh out the package</li>
            <li> Overall, the conditioner is nice the but shampoo is &amp;#34;uneventful.</li>
            <li> Used it on my own hair, same thing.</li>
            <li> Hair is swagin&#x27;, fresh, unmatted, with no tangles.</li>
            <li> Crece Pelo, silicon mix original, silicon mix bambu and my ultimate favorite alter ego garlic mask.</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li> right away I ordered the kanechom (krite) and silicon mix</li>
            <li> really gets your hair clean</li>
            <li> it smells amazing and leaves your natural hair / weave extensions feeling like new again</li>
            <li> My hair was soft and easy to detangle.</li>
            <li> I love lasting fragrance and fresh look.</li>
            <li> And the softness and pleasant smell stays in until I wash my hair a few days</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> Came very fast.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much,  </li>
            <li> thanks amazon!</li>
            <li> Although the product came fast it came spilled!</li>
            <li> Also if you have the most tangled extensions ever this will revive any human hair extension.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Conditioner worked better, but that scent it too much for me to bare.</li>
            <li> thanks for everything!</li>
            <li> The first application I washed my hair and applied conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I was a sceptic at first but after trying the Silicon combo</li>
            <li> It turned out so soft manageable and tangle free</li>
            <li> it was at when I first bought it.  </li>
            <li> Works pretty well, cant stand the smell of this product.</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo and deep conditioner treatment.</li>
            <li> it was kind of knotted a little bit, but when I used the shampoo and conditioner together it came out super silky soft and smooth</li>
            <li> my bundles of hair looked great afterwords BUT BE CAREFUL it will turn your wefts white if you get the product on the wefts...</li>
            <li> I also used it as a deep conditioner for my own hair and it made it really soft.</li>
            <li> The shampoo didn&#x27;t do much, maybe because it&#x27;s my first use</li>
            <li> It smells very strong, but I don&#x27;t really feel that it did the job I expected it to do.  </li>
            <li> This time I let air dry, and was surprised that my beautiful curls were back.</li>
            <li> it may my hair super soft  </li>
            <li> Its a bit strong for me personally but maybe not for anyone else.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stink necessarily, but the smell was so strong</li>
            <li> , however, I finally decided to add more conditioner and worked it in to loosen the matting and it worked very well (as the hair, at first, was a mess that I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be able to wear again).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but i still love the product my hair instantly becomes soft and pretty after applying the conditioner</li>
            <li> and I lost a lot of hair after conditioning (could have been my own fault and the fact that it was the tight curls)</li>
            <li> this is a very highly reccommended product, it you havent used it yet, try it.</li>
            <li> They really give my hair the moisture that it needs and</li>
            <li> but this is a REAL woman who buys literally everything off of amazon n</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> It also does really well for my sew in.</li>
            <li> It tamed the frizz on curly hair and really brought out the curl pattern on textured non relaxed hair.  </li>
            <li> I heard sooo much stuff about these products via youtube.</li>
            <li> it was too much ..</li>
            <li> My ends look healthier when my hair is straight.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the product</li>
            <li> I do not use this on my real hair.</li>
            <li> and it turned out much</li>
            <li> For some reason, I gave it another try on my real hair</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Fast shipping..</li>
            <li> very hydrating.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I really like this item</li>
            <li> I will be ordering them again very soon.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Real Works</li>
            <li> I literally just got out of the shower and ran straight to my laptop to leave this review...</li>
            <li> The silicon mix is very hydrating</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It definitely leaves your hair soft after using it, but I did notice my curls loosen, then eventually my hair was more wavy than curly.</li>
            <li> I felt the shampoo kind of dried my hair (weave)</li>
            <li> , I use it on my natural hair and my Brazilian hair, but I must say it works wonders on my Brazilian hair, will always buy and especially from this seller because I love the price.</li>
            <li> Depends on how frizzy, dry, or tangled the hair is becoming.</li>
            <li> and my hair smelled lik the product for like 4 days despite being outside and doing normal things which was fine with me because people thought i had perfume on</li>
            <li> I know that it work much better for other people...</li>
            <li> I have fine long hair that I have been coloring and bleaching for the summer.</li>
            <li> The shampoo gets hair squeeky clean, and then the conditioner puts the moisture back in the hair on contact.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair pretty soft and shiny...but that smell tho....</li>
            <li> There was no need to use additional products to get the smooth look I seek to achieve with multiple products so frequently.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair very soft!</li>
            <li> This stuff right here was definitely a weave saver I was so ready to toss my weave in the trash until this stuff</li>
            <li> as well I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> The smell gives an extra boost for me, my hair smells like a fresh spring day.</li>
            <li> Left my hair with a build up feeling right after using it.</li>
            <li> This picture is from May with my hair freshly washed and flat ironed (no relaxer).</li>
            <li> Made my hair very soft and pliable just as promised.</li>
            <li> It made my weave very soft ..</li>
            <li> Not only did this product come very fast</li>
            <li> Works miracle on natural hair and weave!</li>
            <li> My hair comes out looking alive and very soft.</li>
            <li> it is even better than when I first bought it, seriously!</li>
            <li> Very trust worthy product, no residue, or heavy feeling in the hair.</li>
            <li> but it actually smells quite fresh and clean and the smell usually fades within a day.</li>
            <li> I use it on my virgin weave and my natural hair and it leaves both with a natural shine,smooth, and soft.</li>
            <li> it smells like Old Lady perfume  </li>
            <li> I have type 4 natural hair</li>
            <li> The product made my hair soft and manageable but it did not perform the &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; on reviving the Peruvian Hair Bundles that I purchased it for.</li>
            <li> so far works just as stated</li>
            <li> But the smell is extremely loud to the point</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using on your natural hair ..</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t like the shampoo on my natural hair</li>
            <li> it was very drying but for my weave definitely a repurchase</li>
            <li> but this moisturizes it completely.</li>
            <li> I use this comb for my hair extensions and leaves is soft and gives it lots of shine.</li>
            <li> a clear indication that the natural oils had been stripped...</li>
            <li> Tried this on 4 different types of hair (Malaysian, Peruvian Straight, Peruvian Body Wave, Brazilian Body Wave).</li>
            <li> friend recommended this product to me, she has coarse hair, very unlike mine</li>
            <li> My hair always feels so soft and hydrated after I use this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;Makes hair soft and manageable without weighing it down.&lt;br /&gt;Smells</li>
            <li> I got this because a beauty shop owner told me that she uses them both on all her client&#x27;s hair, natural and relaxed.</li>
            <li> I wanted to restore the hair for shine, dryness, and to return to its natural body wave.</li>
            <li> Products leave my natural hair shine and sort to touch  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural 4a.</li>
            <li> Im Caucasian, with naturally curly hair - shoulder length.</li>
            <li> I used it once and my hair was so freaking soft and shiny</li>
            <li> After shampooing and using the deep conditioner, my hair feels very shiny and bouncy again.  </li>
            <li> whatever u want 2 call it any hair that needs hydration ending results soft an silky hair from the silicon treatment.</li>
            <li> I also tried them on my natural hair</li>
            <li> I purchased some weave that I was ready to send back</li>
            <li> I have yet to try it on my natural hair.</li>
            <li> it made my hair soft.</li>
            <li> I received the products today (a day early) and tried them out</li>
            <li> It made my natural hair soft</li>
            <li> It make your hair so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I have a weave and use it on my weave and natural leave out once a week so far</li>
            <li> This brings virgin hair back to life it really works would buy again soon</li>
            <li> These products leave my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Used it, big mistake, the hair looked nice immediately after the wash, but once it started  drying, it looked like a big messy hair ball.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair feels so soft after washing my remy human hair, my curls snapped right back.</li>
            <li> Whipped my super dry, tangled, and matted weave back in to shape.</li>
            <li> The shampoo left my hair super dry</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t spend this much on hair products, but this product is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> is a video on it ,  [...] , it makes my hair really soft, no regrets</li>
            <li> the smell was cool at first but the more you use it starts to get annoying</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether this is genuine or not, but I bought this because I saw some youtube videos that claim it to repair humain hair bought on Aliexpress.  </li>
            <li> This product took care of all that and left my hair looking and feeling new.</li>
            <li> I have thick naturally curly hair and its such a pain when I wash my hair because it easily tangles.</li>
            <li> This product brings life back to old hair extensions.</li>
            <li> The hair is back to being soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I researched this product on U-Tube and it has exceeded all my expectations - I currently have a sew in and it makes your hair so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> only this made my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> (I am 9 months pregnant, so my senses may be a little off!</li>
            <li> Over the years my hair has become brittle and coarse due to consistent coloring and age.</li>
            <li> My natural (African American)</li>
            <li> The only thing is: don&#x60;t wash your hair with this more than once a week, because it makes the hair a little heavy.</li>
            <li> But then when dry, I don&#x27;t feel like it really helped in the long term.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that I have very VERY coarse hair and could barely put a comb through my hair with out it getting stuck.</li>
            <li> Brought my dry looking Brazilian weave hair back to a natural shine and bounceness!</li>
            <li> I bought these a while back and did work well for thicker hair, mine is on the fine side so it weighed it down and was too heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li> My dry and tangled Indian Remy hair went back to the soft manageable state</li>
            <li> was my first time using the shampoo, it made my hair feel a little dry and stringy in the shower.</li>
            <li> To make a long story short it took several hours during 2 different visits to get the massive shedding to stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is natural and some tried to introduce me to other products, which i did try once, but that did not work for me.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter because her hair is naturally curly, it would tangle with other shampoos and conditioners did not penetrate as well.</li>
            <li> When I first tried these products, I thought they were overrated and could not see a difference in my real hair or the fake hair</li>
            <li> Next, I tried it on my daughter who has long curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Her hair has been a real struggle for me as I am a latin woman and have never had to deal with such tight curls!!</li>
            <li> BTW the shampoo last LONG!</li>
            <li> My hair (especially the ends) got soooo dry and damaged.</li>
            <li> i have african american relaxed hair, my daughter has natural textured yet curly coarse hair, and my other daughter has coarse very tightly coiled</li>
            <li> , I also like to put a little in a spray bottle with water to mist my natural hair in the morning.</li>
            <li> the shipping was long</li>
            <li> And I mean fast.</li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> and it was a bit dry &amp; frizzy.</li>
            <li> The smell was tolerable, but it seems to dry my hair out.</li>
            <li> Miracle worker for dry and tangled weaves.  </li>
            <li> My hair extensions were extremely dry and matted before this.</li>
            <li> It was dry and supppppeeerrrrr tangled</li>
            <li> My hair was very dry and had no life.</li>
            <li> I only used a little of the product on the hair.</li>
            <li> The Silcone Mix conditioner was suggested as a way to revitalize virgin hair extensions or wigs made of human hair that may have gotten dull and needed to be brought back to life again.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be great but its F*#%ing terrible!</li>
            <li> I never see this in beauty stores in the US (at least near me).</li>
            <li> Not only does it make hair heavy</li>
            <li> I never really trust things like this</li>
            <li> The shampoo was not what I had expected.</li>
            <li> also use this conditioner to revive a human hair wig or weave when it&#x27;s dried out.  </li>
            <li> The products did not work as I expected.</li>
            <li> Not very helpful for me.</li>
            <li> My hair is less frizzy and is weighed down just enough that my curls aren&#x27;t too tight nor too loose.</li>
            <li> but, so far no good.</li>
            <li> With any other conditioner I will put it on at night, wrap my head up and go to sleep.</li>
            <li> and yes I will recommend it to other costumers</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s probably because it would take all other shampoos and conditioners off the market.</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely unmanageable.  </li>
            <li> it left my hair hard after washing it and it was too soapy.....</li>
            <li> My hair was dull and starting to tangle at the ends.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m unable to use them because it makes my scalp very itchy.</li>
            <li> horrible made my hair dry and matted will never use again very strong smell</li>
            <li> I am sending this back, as my real hair is natural and now I am horribly scared to try it on my hair.</li>
            <li> instead my hair came out dry and dull..</li>
            <li> I was shocked how quick It came.</li>
            <li> and I have thick dry curly hair.</li>
            <li> a little...</li>
            <li> When I started using this product, it made my hair softer and a little easier to work with.  </li>
            <li> This product works well with all hair types, my Daughters hair is thin and long, my gran babies hair is long and thick</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make the hair too heavy at all</li>
            <li> The smell was harshly perfumey and sticked to the hair for a while.</li>
            <li> It had gotten oils in it, and I didn&#x27;t want to waste my money.</li>
            <li> and once I twisted up and twisted out this product left my hair very curly</li>
            <li> I dried and straightened my hair</li>
            <li> I wash my extensions with the shampoo...then soak the extensions in a mixture of the conditioner and water for a few hours.</li>
            <li> I have been using these products few times a couple of times a week and like the results.</li>
            <li> it is just a waste of money!</li>
            <li> guess I&#x27;ll just keep looking :/</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews....</li>
            <li> It made my extentions hard, stiff and brittle.</li>
            <li> My daughter has thin hair and the conditioner doesn&#x27;t weight it down and make it appear oily.  </li>
            <li> i mean it&#x27;s not a magical potion that gives you the softest hair in the world,but it ight.</li>
            <li> Not to mention that I live in the south, and humid weather in the summer has always made for bad hair days.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s hard to achieve.my weave come out so silky</li>
            <li> I got this shampoo and conditioner because my hair was tangled and hard.</li>
            <li> My extensions were hard , frizzy, and had no life and the silicon mix was a life saver.</li>
            <li> These products keep my thick hair from being \\&quot;bushy\\&quot; and gives it an unbelieveable shine.  </li>
            <li> That stuff is thick.</li>
            <li> Thick and unruly.  </li>
            <li> No more tangles!</li>
            <li> I also used the Aztec Secret Indian Clay as a hair mask/shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Just wished I didn&#x27;t lose some of the product due to it spilling during shipping. :(  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll go wrong</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sad to say my hair didn&#x27;t even look close to anyone in those videos...</li>
            <li> you know us sistas hate our weave looking dull.</li>
            <li> am artificially blond and it did not helped my hair....</li>
            <li> While I absolutely hate the smell of the conditioner (alas why I have 4 stars and not 5)</li>
            <li> not only hated the way it smelled but even my boyfriend  wanted me to was my hair again to get rid of the awful smell</li>
            <li> I have very complicated hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;That scared me so bad</li>
            <li> I was shocked and disappointed after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li> does NOTHING like it states, VERY unhappy</li>
            <li> I hate the shampu and the hair treatment is ok.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t throw away that bad batch wig or wefts, ladies!  </li>
            <li> I have a hair Very bad</li>
            <li> I purchased them, used them and hated them!</li>
            <li> The Malaysian hair did tangle &amp; matte horribly while washing</li>
            <li> The shampoo is terrible makes my hair feel like straw.</li>
            <li> it was horrible.</li>
            <li> once i use it i feel my hair is coming from the roots, i had a terrible hair loss.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love it is really good and I feel my hair healthy 😁</li>
            <li> I love this line of products. They really give my hair the moisture that it needs and the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is gross.. I thought it would be great but its F*#%ing terrible! Not only does it make hair heavy it smells like Old Lady perfume  not only hated the way it smelled but even my boyfriend  wanted me to was my hair again to get rid of the awful smell and it just lingered till about the 3rd time I washed it..</li>
            <li> I just received the product in the mail and decided to tryit out. Let me start off by saying that I have very VERY coarse hair and could barely put a comb through my hair with out it getting stuck. But after using this product, my hair looks amazing! It is shiny, smells amazing, and looks like I just left the Dominican Hair Salon! And may I add I can actually comb through my hair and it has body. I love love LOVE this product... :)</li>
            <li> Smell good can&#x27;t wait to use it. I heard its crack for hair, purchased for maintaining my weave.</li>
            <li> Love&lt;br /&gt;This product . And the smell its awsome</li>
            <li> This products are cheap but works great!</li>
            <li> I never really trust things like this but this is a REAL woman who buys literally everything off of amazon n I can say I absolutely love this hair product. the entire package of shampoo and conditioner works wonders on worn and brittle Brazilian weave extensions. n you know us sistas hate our weave looking dull. I say purchase these two n you&#x27;ll go wrong no where!!!!! very very very satisfied customer!!! thanks amazon! my hair looks refreshed n hydrated and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been drying to get my hair to get back to!!!! try it ladies!</li>
            <li> Just awesome and arrived on time</li>
            <li> Ótimo para cabelos que necessitam uma hidratação profunda, pois deixa-o liso, sem frizz e sedoso.Eu simplemente adorei. Apenas achei que poderia ser mais cheiroso, achei um pouco forte.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have type 4 natural hair and I used this product. My hair was soft and easy to detangle. Next, I tried it on my daughter who has long curly hair.  It made her hair nice soft and defined her curls even more. I will order more, my life as a relaxer free women just got better.</li>
            <li> The product made my hair soft and manageable but it did not perform the &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; on reviving the Peruvian Hair Bundles that I purchased it for.</li>
            <li> I cant tell the differnece in this shampoo and conditioner and others. The silicon did not seem to make a difference.</li>
            <li> Comes With Both Shampoo and Hair Treatment Which is Conditioner .. This Stuff works good on your permed, natural and transitioning hair. I&#x27;ve even tried it on my Brazilian Extentions and it made the hair feel 100% healthier !!</li>
            <li> These products keep my thick hair from being \\&quot;bushy\\&quot; and gives it an unbelieveable shine.  My daughter has thin hair and the conditioner doesn&#x27;t weight it down and make it appear oily.  I&#x27;d recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Made my hair very soft and pliable just as promised.</li>
            <li> Product is awesome makes your hair silky smooth would recommend this to anyone !</li>
            <li> Works miracle on natural hair and weave! Will definitely purchase this set again. BTW the shampoo last LONG!</li>
            <li> Smells strong but works well</li>
            <li> It really works. The smell is strong &amp; partially pleasant but tolerable.</li>
            <li> No! This stuff triggers my migraines. It made my hair tangle up. I wish I could get my money back!</li>
            <li> Just received my product. Shipping was very fast. I gave three stars because when I opened the box product had leaked out of one of the containers all over the container bottles. The product does have a chemical smell similar to a perm. I will leave another review once I use the product.</li>
            <li> Love that set of hair care. Not expensive and does a great job!</li>
            <li> The best hair products! They leave hair smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li> I love it, and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> so far works just as stated</li>
            <li> I love the Silicon Mix Treatment so much that I got my daughter to use it, and then she liked it so much she used it on her daughters hair. It makes the hair so soft and easy to comb, the shine in my hair is amazing. This product works well with all hair types, my Daughters hair is thin and long, my gran babies hair is long and thick and I have thick dry curly hair. Our hair is so beautiful  I am so happy with Silicon Mix !  I have a closet full of hair products that do not compare to Silicon Mix, and priced at $35 or  more I will not be purchasing again.  I like to keep it on with a plastic cap for about 20 min, I also like to put a little in a spray bottle with water to mist my natural hair in the morning. For me , this is a great product and the pricing is even  better, I&#x27;ll always be able to afford it !!  THANK YOU THANK YOU</li>
            <li> An entire bottle was spilled</li>
            <li> Makes my natural hair really strong and healthy. It also does really well for my sew in. It doesn&#x27;t make the hair too heavy at all and it smells great!</li>
            <li> Does not smell great!!!!</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast! I have used the conditioner before but not the shampoo...I used it for the first time and fell in love...I will continue to order it, and from this seller as well...can&#x27;t  rave enough about it! 💖💖</li>
            <li> I chose this product after seeing reviews on youtube.  This product works wonderfully!  It tamed the frizz on curly hair and really brought out the curl pattern on textured non relaxed hair.  I used the conditioner on a curly weave and also on my own wavy hair as a deep conditioner.  It kept the tangles out of both.  The scent is strong and smells great to me!  I will definitely be purchasing the conditioner again and will recommend to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I heard sooo much stuff about these products via youtube. I purchased them, used them and hated them! It made my extentions hard, stiff and brittle. The smell was harshly perfumey and sticked to the hair for a while. I will give it another try and give you a updated review but, so far no good.</li>
            <li> I used this product to wash unprocessed Brazilian hair and it worked great. I only used a little of the product on the hair. There was a lot of product in the containers. I&#x27;m very pleased with the two products.</li>
            <li> good for controlling frizzies</li>
            <li> I have to give this a mid rating because it was my fault this didn&#x27;t work for me, but I am sure this is a good product. I also want to provide a warning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE DO NOT DO WHAT I DID.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So hear is my warning. Follow the directions if you are using this product on your hair. With any other conditioner I will put it on at night, wrap my head up and go to sleep. Well that doesn&#x27;t work with this product AT ALL!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Y&#x27;all, let me tell you, the next morning I got in the shower and my hair was so knotted and matted and IT WAS COMING OUT IN HUMUNGOUS CLUMPS!!!!! Talk about having a total freak out. I called my stylist in a panic and I guess she could tell from my hysteria that it was an emergency so she told me to stop everything, don&#x27;t touch my head and come in immediately. To make a long story short it took several hours during 2 different visits to get the massive shedding to stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That scared me so bad I have not even tried it on my wigs LOL. I have totally punked out. Both products are sitting under my sink in permanent time-out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the good side, it smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a 3C</li>
            <li> It works .. It made my weave very soft .. But the smell is extremely loud to the point it was too much .. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using on your natural hair ..</li>
            <li> The Best !!! I Love Love Love it</li>
            <li> I have a full head of fine, curly hair. My hair is less frizzy and is weighed down just enough that my curls aren&#x27;t too tight nor too loose. My ends look healthier when my hair is straight.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair pretty soft and shiny...but that smell tho....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great on weave, it comes right back to life ;)</li>
            <li> Just as described great product. Im in love with this product and would recommend it to anyone. Thanks for the product</li>
            <li> I bought these a while back and did work well for thicker hair, mine is on the fine side so it weighed it down and was too heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is great.  My hair is very healthy as a result of using it.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about two years now.  My hair is natural and some tried to introduce me to other products, which i did try once, but that did not work for me.  I have to stick to what I know, and this is it!</li>
            <li> I discovered this while watching a youtube video. The Silcone Mix conditioner was suggested as a way to revitalize virgin hair extensions or wigs made of human hair that may have gotten dull and needed to be brought back to life again. This does the job. If you have any human hair that you havent used in a while, or have used to death, try this before retiring it. Curly, wavy or straight, this stuff adds shine and makes the hair look as good as new. I do not use this on my real hair. i know silicones arent good for your hair and this is exactly what this is. But for wigs, weaves, and extensions...i would reccommend it!</li>
            <li> This stuff right here was definitely a weave saver I was so ready to toss my weave in the trash until this stuff but I didn&#x27;t like the shampoo on my natural hair it was very drying but for my weave definitely a repurchase and I bought this on a bundle deal</li>
            <li> Although the product came fast it came spilled!</li>
            <li> I have very complicated hair but this moisturizes it completely. Also if you have the most tangled extensions ever this will revive any human hair extension. Leave it in for hours and it&#x27;s a miracle.</li>
            <li> This product works great will be shopping again</li>
            <li> After what felt like a million YouTube vids and many trips to area beauty supply stores making this purchase online via Amazon was the best thing I could have done. Product works great and once I run out will be ordering the bigger size!!</li>
            <li> This combo is the ultimate in hair product, wonderful smell and leaves the hair manageable and also my hair seemed to have grown a lot since I have been using it, which has been years. Very trust worthy product, no residue, or heavy feeling in the hair. It leaves it smelling great and ready for styling or just as is.</li>
            <li> this product was great,&lt;br /&gt;Here is a video on it ,  [...] , it makes my hair really soft, no regrets</li>
            <li> I love this product. If it weren&#x27;t for this product all the hair extensions I buy would have to be disposed of. This product brings life back to old hair extensions.</li>
            <li> horrible made my hair dry and matted will never use again very strong smell do not believe the hype from utube this product does not work it is just a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Although this product may be nice on extensions, I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using it on natural hair. It definitely leaves your hair soft after using it, but I did notice my curls loosen, then eventually my hair was more wavy than curly.</li>
            <li> The shampoo was not what I had expected. ..it left my hair hard after washing it and it was too soapy.....and the silicon mix itself was okay..also..</li>
            <li> Love the conditioner more then the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love it this product breathes new life into hair and hair extensions. I use this comb for my hair extensions and leaves is soft and gives it lots of shine.</li>
            <li> Received quickly and great product. I will order again</li>
            <li> Whipped my super dry, tangled, and matted weave back in to shape. I Love it and it made my leave out look good!... and my hair still smells good after 2 weeks!!!</li>
            <li> I love, I repeat LOVE this product.  I use it on my virgin weave and my natural hair and it leaves both with a natural shine,smooth, and soft. I usually don&#x27;t spend this much on hair products, but this product is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> It is no miracle product, works about the same as my cholesterol.</li>
            <li> I saw a great improvement in my hair. Its now thicker and more manageable.</li>
            <li> I ment to review this weeks ago. It&#x27;s awesome this Is my second purchase. I was shocked how quick It came. Thank you!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! This is my second order from this seller. Fast shipping! Will order again,</li>
            <li> Great product. Will purchase again..I will recommend to anyone...I swear it will bring your weave back to life...n I left one star off BC the shipping was long</li>
            <li> Recommended by my hairstylist, and I love the way it makes my hair feel so soft and silky. Great product.</li>
            <li> I bought this to bring back to life a weave I had gotten. It had gotten oils in it, and I didn&#x27;t want to waste my money. As soon as I applied the shampoo, the hair matted up in balls. I only salvaged about 2% of the hair that was on the track. I was shocked and disappointed after reading the reviews. I am sending this back, as my real hair is natural and now I am horribly scared to try it on my hair. Conditioner worked better, but that scent it too much for me to bare. It was all over my hands, and literally began giving me a headache.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once, but it made my hair shinier.</li>
            <li> love love love the product</li>
            <li> This product was amazing for both my daughter and myself!! My daughter is biracial with black and latin decent. Her hair has been a real struggle for me as I am a latin woman and have never had to deal with such tight curls!! This is the first product  I&#x27;ve found to help untangle her hair! I&#x27;m buying more for myself and sending some to her dad&#x27;s family to use on her ASAP!!</li>
            <li> After watching numerous YouTube and Amazon reviews, I purchased this combo set. After using them I was sorely dissapointed. The shampoo left my hair super dry n crunchy feeling; a clear indication that the natural oils had been stripped... There was no noticeable difference after using the conditioner</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good and it made my hair very soft n silky and yes I will recommend it to other costumers</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and leaves your hair looking great</li>
            <li> Tried this on 4 different types of hair (Malaysian, Peruvian Straight, Peruvian Body Wave, Brazilian Body Wave). The Malaysian hair did tangle &amp; matte horribly while washing and I lost a lot of hair after conditioning (could have been my own fault and the fact that it was the tight curls), however, I finally decided to add more conditioner and worked it in to loosen the matting and it worked very well (as the hair, at first, was a mess that I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be able to wear again).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wearing the hair, I&#x27;ve only worn the Peruvian Body Wave and it was a bit dry &amp; frizzy. However, when I washed it again (while on my head), I used a different shampoo and conditioner and added Olive Oil (something I truly recommend from my experience) to the conditioner and it turned out much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All and all, I do think the product will be good, but I recommend adding Olive Oil to the conditioning phase, ALWAYS and for any conditioner that you use (that stuff is AMAZING)!!!</li>
            <li> *I have fine long hair that I have been coloring and bleaching for the summer. My hair (especially the ends) got soooo dry and damaged. It just always looked &amp;#34;thirsty&amp;#34; and brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend recommended this product to me, she has coarse hair, very unlike mine but I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;This was my first time using the shampoo, it made my hair feel a little dry and stringy in the shower. But after conditioning there were no complaints. I have been using this conditioner for about a month and let me tell you it&#x27;s AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;This product has an amazing smell IMO. My hair always feels so soft and hydrated after I use this product. And the softness and pleasant smell stays in until I wash my hair a few days later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;Makes hair soft and manageable without weighing it down.&lt;br /&gt;Smells great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo isn&#x27;t clarifying. It doesn&#x27;t get my hair as clean as I would like.&lt;br /&gt;Because the shampoo doesn’t clean that well, it leads to a lot of buildup from the silicone that coats the shaft</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase. . You don&#x27;t even need the shampoo the condition work wonderful on bringing you weave back to life!!</li>
            <li> I purchase this product and I am so glad I did. I am just amazed at the results I received while using this two products. My hair is so much better looking and feels soft and the beautiful natural shine that it leaves on my hair is just amazing.</li>
            <li> It actually worked and I didn&#x27;t think it would but it brought my virgin brazilian hair back to life</li>
            <li> I got this because a beauty shop owner told me that she uses them both on all her client&#x27;s hair, natural and relaxed. This stuff wasn&#x27;t all that special to me. It made my hair feel thicker and nappier, lol. I guess because it wasn&#x27;t a good moisturizing shampoo and conditioner combo. The smell was tolerable, but it seems to dry my hair out. Won&#x27;t be buying anymore.</li>
            <li> I used this product on my virgin hair extensions that I have had for 9 months. I wanted to restore the hair for shine, dryness, and to return to its natural body wave. This product took care of all that and left my hair looking and feeling new. I would tell anyone to use this on their virgin hair extensions that they have had over 6 months. Its a great product!!!!</li>
            <li> made my Brazilian hair Brand New and flawless</li>
            <li> This shampoo and condition set gives hair tracks life ! I love it for fake hair.</li>
            <li> It was okay for me....I felt the shampoo kind of dried my hair (weave) a little...I have used the shampoo more than once, just to see if it was just that one time but no...The condition was much better....I know that it work much better for other people...I will used the condition again but not the shampoo...just my experience</li>
            <li> Wife loved it, it really works well</li>
            <li> I purchased Silicon Mix Hair treatment and  shampoo for my granddaughters they love conditioning&lt;br /&gt;their hair feels.  I love lasting fragrance and fresh look. I will continue to make this purchase for a longtime.</li>
            <li> It works great as a hair treatment revitalizer! Easy to use... then wait!  Brought my dry looking Brazilian weave hair back to a natural shine and bounceness!</li>
            <li> I liked the products but I&#x27;m unable to use them because it makes my scalp very itchy.</li>
            <li> Products leave my natural hair shine and sort to touch  i love it</li>
            <li> i brought some Brizallian kinky curly hair and when I took it out it was kind of knotted a little bit, but when I used the shampoo and conditioner together it came out super silky soft and smooth</li>
            <li> I got what I asked for</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on in the Dominican Republic, but this hair conditioner is on point.  By itself, it&#x27;s a good conditioner, but I mix it with the Crecepelo Tratamiento Fitoterapeutico Natural conditioner and my hair was banging.  My natural (African American) 3C hair felt and looked like satin after a blow out.  My hair has never looked or felt like that in my entire life.  I was mesmerized.  It was a hair miracle.  I also used the Aztec Secret Indian Clay as a hair mask/shampoo.  This combo is everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this conditioner to revive a human hair wig or weave when it&#x27;s dried out.  This conditioner literally rejuvenates and revives the hair after a deep condition.  Don&#x27;t throw away that bad batch wig or wefts, ladies!  Try this conditioner first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used the shampoo.</li>
            <li> When I first tried these products, I thought they were overrated and could not see a difference in my real hair or the fake hair I used it on. For some reason, I gave it another try on my real hair and now I can&#x27;t wash my hair without it! The conditioner is amazing and makes my hair feel so smooth and silky. My hair has also started growing but I can&#x27;t say for sure that it had something to do with the silicon mix or not. This picture is from May with my hair freshly washed and flat ironed (no relaxer).</li>
            <li> This is a good product. It makes my extensions feel pretty good. The shampoo leaves your hair feeling squeaky clean feeling which I love!!</li>
            <li> My first time buying this and its great so far.</li>
            <li> The package was wrap securely so the shampoo and conditioner will not spill while it was being shipped. Fast shipping and this shampoo and conditioner is great for virgin hair it can bring any hair back to life</li>
            <li> Smell so good and my hair is very soft</li>
            <li> thanks for everything! I loved!</li>
            <li> AMAZING FOR YOUR HAIR</li>
            <li> This stuff is so good I luv it my daughter&#x27;s hair got soo silky and she has poofy hair so that&#x27;s hard to achieve.my weave come out so silky as well I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Good for detangling but there are better dominican products out there. The shampoo is terrible makes my hair feel like straw. I&#x27;m a natural 4a.</li>
            <li> I loved the way it left my hair feeling silky and once I twisted up and twisted out this product left my hair very curly and it didnt frizz out</li>
            <li> Love using this product in combination with the Brazilian Hair Treatment. The result is amazing.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Make sure you rinse out the conditioner though. That stuff is thick.</li>
            <li> This product is the best if you want to revive your virgin hair even your own hair... the smell was cool at first but the more you use it starts to get annoying but i still love the product my hair instantly becomes soft and pretty after applying the conditioner and it last until your next wash so Silicone mix gets a A++ from T</li>
            <li> I saw these product on YouTube and got excited..right away I ordered the kanechom (krite) and silicon mix but I&#x27;m sad to say my hair didn&#x27;t even look close to anyone in those videos...instead my hair came out dry and dull..I am Hispanic and over the years of hair dyes I was hoping to find a product to make my hair healthy again..I stopped dying my hair and began trimming it...and was hoping to find a great deep conditioner but for some reason it didn&#x27;t work for me..guess I&#x27;ll just keep looking :/</li>
            <li> OMGGGGGGGG THANK YOU!!! My Weave was RUINED by chlorine after using the treatment it is even better than when I first bought it, seriously!</li>
            <li> Not only did this product come very fast it smells amazing and leaves your natural hair / weave extensions feeling like new again I will definitely be purchasing more!!!</li>
            <li> I stumbled across this product searching for a silicone based conditioner. After reading the reviews, I decided to purchase and give it a chance. Im Caucasian, with naturally curly hair - shoulder length. Over the years my hair has become brittle and coarse due to consistent coloring and age. This product is amazing...everything the awesome reviews say and more. The first application I washed my hair and applied conditioner. I left on and used the bonnet dryer for around 30 minutes then rinsed out thoroughly.  I dried and straightened my hair and it was smooth and silky. There was no need to use additional products to get the smooth look I seek to achieve with multiple products so frequently.  2 days later I washed my hair with a clarifying shampoo and applied the treatment to my hair again and left on for 3-5 minutes and rinsed thoroughly.  This time I let air dry, and was surprised that my beautiful curls were back. I&#x27;ve not seen them in a while. I thought it was because my hair was too damaged to get that beautiful bouncy natural curl anymore. This product has started improving/repairing my hair.  Not to mention that I live in the south, and humid weather in the summer has always made for bad hair days. Not anymore!!!!  My hair has been frizz free since I started using this product.  I usually don&#x27;t write reviews....However, I was compelled to share my results / experience with this product. I have already ordered more and it will now be a staple in my home!  Obviously different products have different results on different type hair.  But for this price, it&#x27;s worth trying. I was definitely NOT disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing for my natural hair and my weave too! While I absolutely hate the smell of the conditioner (alas why I have 4 stars and not 5) it&#x27;s extremely effective. My hair has never been so easy to comb and manage. And as far as my raggedy, beaten to pieces weave, it&#x27;s good as new as well. I absolutely love this stuff, now if only it smelled better. Yuck.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it makes my hair so soft and super curly.</li>
            <li> If you have Peruvian or Brazilian weave this is the shampoo and conditioner you want.  It works wonders for tangling shedding shine it does it all and smells great. Especially conditioner</li>
            <li> my bundles of hair looked great afterwords BUT BE CAREFUL it will turn your wefts white if you get the product on the wefts...so keep only on the hair. I left it on over night 24hrs</li>
            <li> I use these two for unruly weave/extensions. It works okay?! I wash my extensions with the shampoo...then soak the extensions in a mixture of the conditioner and water for a few hours. Depends on how frizzy, dry, or tangled the hair is becoming. Rinse out the conditioner and BAM. The hair is back to being soft and manageable. This stuff is a miracle in a bottle. I have to order more asap. Side Note: wash the hair once a month with a clarifying shampoo if you use this stuff regularly as this does have some build-up.</li>
            <li> I love this brand! It does wonders for my hair. It makes my hair silky smooth &amp; has such a great aroma</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter because her hair is naturally curly, it would tangle with other shampoos and conditioners did not penetrate as well. This product detangles and keeps her hair shiny.</li>
            <li> The product was great! I used it once and my hair was so freaking soft and shiny and I could run my fingers through it without any tangles!</li>
            <li> I tried this product because of the reviews i&#x27;ve read.  I have to say that I was a sceptic at first but after trying the Silicon combo, I would give it ten stars if I could.  My hair was dull and starting to tangle at the ends.  After shampooing and using the deep conditioner, my hair feels very shiny and bouncy again.  The smell gives an extra boost for me, my hair smells like a fresh spring day.</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair feels. I&#x27;m very happy with my hair. I love the Internet because I never would have found this.</li>
            <li> Very great for hair. Really good. Love it. I have a hair Very bad and this product save it when i more need</li>
            <li> does NOTHING like it states, VERY unhappy</li>
            <li> I love the way this product makes my hair feel.  the is also nice.  I will be buying more when I run out of what I have.  thanks</li>
            <li> I got this shampoo and conditioner because my hair was tangled and hard. The conditioner brought it back to life.</li>
            <li> Great price shipping was so fast! Good quantity enough for me &amp; my daughter to share at a reasonable price was perfect for my household</li>
            <li> This product did an excellent job restoring my human hair weave. It turned out so soft manageable and tangle free</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.. It makes my hair very soft!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for three years and it does not disappoint.</li>
            <li> I like this product, and I love how my hair feels. it has a great smell and my husband loved the way my hair smell after using it. Now that I switch to a Keratin treatment, I can no longer use this product again.</li>
            <li> Love it , will order again!</li>
            <li> The Shampoo is fine, but what you really want is the conditioner. It smell wonderful and it makes my hair feel great.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff on extensions</li>
            <li> left my brazillian hair smooth and revived great product will defelenty buy again</li>
            <li> Have used twice since purchase and my hair feels and looks great! Will  purchase again</li>
            <li> i have african american relaxed hair, my daughter has natural textured yet curly coarse hair, and my other daughter has coarse very tightly coiled hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this shampoo is wonderful.  very hydrating.  works well with all of our textures and even works well on virgin extensions.  when followed by the conditioner it is a wonderful quick working process.  hair is very light and easy to manage with just these two products.  we also use the leave in, but when we dont we still have great results.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for virgin hair.. extensions, weave, whatever u want 2 call it any hair that needs hydration ending results soft an silky hair from the silicon treatment. The shampoo, I think, I could have saved my money. My personal thought on the treatment is your hair can get cleansed treated moisturized an brought back to life without the shampoo. There&#x27;s a after smell very good can&#x27;t tell you really what it is but I no when I get done with my hair my husband is alll in my head. I also have a review and show the product on my youtube channel if you have anymore questions or want to see what my 1st time using it looks like, my channel name is melony23mj check it out. Thx</li>
            <li> This product had my hair feeling like it was fresh out the package</li>
            <li> The product was good overall,nice scent and works like it should.</li>
            <li> glad I found these products great for going natural</li>
            <li> I used this on my weave and yes it brought it back to life</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. This product is amazing. I have great results with my hair. I would definitely continue purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> Came very fast. And I mean fast. The actual product is great. The only thing is when you use the shampoo start off with maybe a nickle size amount because it produces a lot of suds.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair feel silky even when it&#x27;s coarse.  I used it once before and bought it from my salon but this price was great and the product is real.</li>
            <li> I really like this item, I use it on my natural hair and my Brazilian hair, but I must say it works wonders on my Brazilian hair, will always buy and especially from this seller because I love the price.</li>
            <li> The products did not work as I expected. I purchased them to detangle and restore my weave but they did not do anything for it. I also tried them on my natural hair and I wasn&#x27;t impressed. Overall, the conditioner is nice the but shampoo is &amp;#34;uneventful.</li>
            <li> I used a video on Youtube as my guide with using this product and it worked GREAT!!!!!! My dry and tangled Indian Remy hair went back to the soft manageable state it was at when I first bought it.  I also found the smell to be really nice.</li>
            <li> Bambu version is better.</li>
            <li> my hair is alright, i mean it&#x27;s not a magical potion that gives you the softest hair in the world,but it ight.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner has done wonders to my Brazilian hair! After leaving the conditioner in for about an hour, the hair is smooth as silk! One con is the smell reminds me of ban deodorant! (I am 9 months pregnant, so my senses may be a little off! Lol 😄) 3 weeks later, my hair is still bouncy and shiny, after curling and straightening. Overall I love this combo, it is now my go to wash and conditioner!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether this is genuine or not, but I bought this because I saw some youtube videos that claim it to repair humain hair bought on Aliexpress.  Used it, big mistake, the hair looked nice immediately after the wash, but once it started  drying, it looked like a big messy hair ball.  Used it on my own hair, same thing.</li>
            <li> Product was just as described. I used this on my virgin hair extensions as a deep conditioner. I will use it sparingly therefore it will last me a while. I liked it, gave good results.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well, cant stand the smell of this product. Puts a nice light conditioning on the hair, I just dont like the fragrance</li>
            <li> Not very helpful for me. Left my hair with a build up feeling right after using it.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair very manageable and I love the smell. I will be ordering them again very soon. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I Swear this product is a miracle worker, it came on time, in great condition and packing.  Makes my hair feels so soft after washing my remy human hair, my curls snapped right back. I recommend this product and vendor to all my girls.</li>
            <li> I have been using these products few times a couple of times a week and like the results. My hair was very dry and had no life. I found that the products put some moisture back as well as some shine. Will keep using until finish the bottles and see final results then.</li>
            <li> Great product quick sshipmentand delivery I love this product it really works great conditioner and shampoo to get your hair clean really gets your hair clean</li>
            <li> Love!! Best stuff to bring natural or weaves back to life!!</li>
            <li> I purchased some weave that I was ready to send back it was horrible. I purchased this product and it brought the hair back to life. I also used it as a deep conditioner for my own hair and it made it really soft.</li>
            <li> Miracle worker for dry and tangled weaves.  This stuff snaps back human hair like you would not believe. I combine using this shampoo/conditioner with apple cider vinegar.  It&#x27;s worth every penny!  Hair is swagin&#x27;, fresh, unmatted, with no tangles. It minimizes shedding for me also.  I&#x27;m always getting compliments about my hair. I never see this in beauty stores in the US (at least near me). That&#x27;s probably because it would take all other shampoos and conditioners off the market. 😊 Price is also affordable. I&#x27;ll will be returning soon. Thanks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Real Works But Results Don&#x27;t Last As Ling</li>
            <li> It was a waisted of money....everything doesn&#x27;t work for everyone an. I am a true believer in that!!!</li>
            <li> I love it, and honestly I recommend the conditioner  it, it&#x27;s really good for damaged hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-update : 3/23/2014&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the shampoo/ conditioner  3 times a per week ... The conditioner is amazing, keeps my hair shiny healthy, but i don&#x27;t recommend the shampoo, it&#x27;s very strong  once i use it i feel my hair is coming from the roots, i had a terrible hair loss. I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> I found out about this product from YouTube and it is everything they say it is and even more.  I love the results and I will continue using it.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. I was recommended to use this by my hairstylist. I would recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> Good product. I love it.</li>
            <li> Very great product. Bottle size was bigger than I thought it would be and left my hair feeling silky.</li>
            <li> Loved the product! Just wished I didn&#x27;t lose some of the product due to it spilling during shipping. :(  It smells really good too.</li>
            <li> This combination has saved my extensions numerous times!</li>
            <li> I researched this product on U-Tube and it has exceeded all my expectations - I currently have a sew in and it makes your hair so soft and manageable. It smells great and I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This product had my Brazilian hair extensions feeling like silk. I have just purchased the kanechom and hope to get even better results!!! My extensions were hard , frizzy, and had no life and the silicon mix was a life saver. I also used it on my relaxed hair and my hair flowed. Also my order got here on time, and I was always updated.</li>
            <li> Love this product for hair extensions</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! Used them on my damaged virgin extensions and it came out great!</li>
            <li> This works great for bringing life to my human hair extensions. I wash it with the shampoo and then let it soak in conditioner with water for hours at a time. My hair comes out looking alive and very soft. Only CON I have is the smell. Its a bit strong for me personally but maybe not for anyone else.</li>
            <li> Excellent for my extensions!  I have yet to try it on my natural hair.</li>
            <li> Overall i like this product i know people say that the smell is strong nd smells like medication but to me it smells like baby powder stuff which is cool I washed my virgin hair with the shampoo and conditioner and it may my hair super soft  and my hair smelled lik the product for like 4 days despite being outside and doing normal things which was fine with me because people thought i had perfume on but if you don&#x27;t like that smell all the time I would advise you not to condition your hair overnight only do it for a couple of hours or if you do want to condition it overnight let it air out before putting the virgin hair back in your head. i also used it later on when i bleached my virgin hair and wanted to condition it overnight using th conditioner only this made my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much,  it made my hair soft. The only thing is: don&#x60;t wash your hair with this more than once a week, because it makes the hair a little heavy.</li>
            <li> It smells very strong, but I don&#x27;t really feel that it did the job I expected it to do.  Left hair soft for a while during the time the hair was wet.  But then when dry, I don&#x27;t feel like it really helped in the long term.</li>
            <li> I literally just got out of the shower and ran straight to my laptop to leave this review... AMAZING results. I received the products today (a day early) and tried them out and I must say, I already see progress. My hair extensions were extremely dry and matted before this. The shampoo didn&#x27;t do much, maybe because it&#x27;s my first use but the treatment worked wonders! My friend recommended them for my microbead extensions and I love them already after the first use. Will definitely purchase this product again...</li>
            <li> I purchased the original and it has a really strong smell. It doesn&#x27;t stink necessarily, but the smell was so strong I got headaches. It made my natural hair soft but I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell.</li>
            <li> It make your hair so soft and manageable. I have a weave and use it on my weave and natural leave out once a week so far so good. It does leave like a baby powdery scent on your hair but it actually smells quite fresh and clean and the smell usually fades within a day. I definitely recommend this!!!</li>
            <li> Great price! Great product!</li>
            <li> My wife normaly uses these produtcs and like a lot. She recomends as a good  treatment that makes the hair very soft</li>
            <li> Great protects it is actually a lot look the smell is also great</li>
            <li> wife loves it and keeps buying it for herself and family members.</li>
            <li> I really love this combo. The shampoo gets hair squeeky clean, and then the conditioner puts the moisture back in the hair on contact. The silicon mix is very hydrating and I love the frangrace. Im in love with dominican products! Crece Pelo, silicon mix original, silicon mix bambu and my ultimate favorite alter ego garlic mask. After a fresh trim these products will keep hair strong and healthy. Beautiful hair is the best!</li>
            <li> I hate the shampu and the hair treatment is ok.&lt;br /&gt;I am artificially blond and it did not helped my hair....</li>
            <li> this is a very highly reccommended product, it you havent used it yet, try it.</li>
            <li> The best shampoo/conditioner I have ever used!</li>
            <li> This brings virgin hair back to life it really works would buy again soon</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo and deep conditioner treatment. I have thick naturally curly hair and its such a pain when I wash my hair because it easily tangles. These products leave my hair soft and manageable. The scent is also an added plus.</li>
            <li> Love love love,makes hair feel really soft!!!</li>
            <li> Works like a charm! This helped my weave come back to life! It was dry and supppppeeerrrrr tangled but this made my hair come back to life, restored the luster and made it flow like butter through my fingers! No more tangles! I use it once a week on my weave and it works great! The shampoo and treatment are very big so it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely unmanageable.  Thick and unruly.  When I started using this product, it made my hair softer and a little easier to work with.  Thanks.</li>
