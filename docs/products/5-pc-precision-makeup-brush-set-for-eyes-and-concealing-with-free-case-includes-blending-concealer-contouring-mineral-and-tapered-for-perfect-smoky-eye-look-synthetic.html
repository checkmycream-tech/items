            <li>These are really nice brushes.  </li>
            <li>I have an obsession with makeup brushes &amp; I love a good deal</li>
            <li>I have tons of makeup brushes from just about every popular brand from luxury to drugstore</li>
            <li>I tugged on the ferrules of each brush &amp; they are on there nice &amp; snug.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i received these for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>They are of excellent quality and overall an amazing value!</li>
            <li>I was so impressed with the high quality of these brushes.</li>
            <li>Not a fan of the brush for use of blending under eye concealer but love it for blending in eye primer though I think using your finger is just as effective.</li>
            <li>It was amazing , I love ...</li>
            <li>The brushes are made well, they are extremely soft and they are at a great price!</li>
            <li>amazing brushes kit with cute packaging</li>
            <li>But, the girls at Beauty Junkees were great and helped me out right away.  </li>
            <li>When I have to do my makeup in the car, one side of the canister fits in the cup holder in my car and makes it easy to do my makeup while I&#x27;m traveling (as a passenger!).  </li>
            <li>They are great brushes for a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>That in itself is very important and shows the quality of the business and their products.  </li>
            <li>beautiful thick heads, and a perfect size for every application.</li>
            <li>l love these brushes.</li>
            <li>Overall the brushes are amazing!!!</li>
            <li>These brushes are ok.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love the Travel kit</li>
            <li>I have tried many many many brushes.</li>
            <li>I would like to have seen some skinnier brushes for shadow, eye liner i.e. more variety in brush heads.</li>
            <li>Love these brushes.</li>
            <li>Love these brushes.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this brush.</li>
            <li>It helps me to apply my makeup so much better than I thought it would.</li>
            <li>This is the second set I ordered; really impressed by the quality.</li>
            <li>Size works great to get real close to your nose area.</li>
            <li>They got here 4 days faster than I was expecting them to, and I can&#x27;t wait to use them :)</li>
            <li>I plan on purchasing more.  </li>
            <li>and she loved it right away and ordered one set herself too.  </li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>Great travel brush set, made from high quality materials and love the travel case.  </li>
            <li>I mainly use it to contour my nose, but would work great for eyes as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great deal for high quality brushes.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re of a nice durable quality, and have good density but really soft bristles.</li>
            <li>I did have a problem with the head coming off, but they sent me another one right away!!  </li>
            <li>I have high end brushes but these brushes are just as good.  </li>
            <li>which, I thought, was very cool &amp; further demonstrates all of the great things I have heard &amp; read about Beauty Junkees.</li>
            <li>When I received the brushes (shipping was really quick!)</li>
            <li>It is a perfect little makeup holder for what I need to touch up at work.</li>
            <li>They can be used for eye shadows and for precise concealing and contouring.  </li>
            <li>Great Brushes at a low price !</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t feel comfortable leaving a review.</li>
            <li>There is nothing cheap about these brushes.</li>
            <li>It helps to smooth out things.</li>
            <li>Thank you for such great service.  </li>
            <li>They are slightly bigger than I imagined, but still really great.</li>
            <li>However, in the time that I had, they worked fantastic.</li>
            <li>The brushes feel comfortable when u are using them.</li>
            <li>The benefit to brushes over sponges is that the product you are applying is sort of &amp;#34;absorbed&amp;#34; by the bristles of the brush (as opposed to sitting on the surface of the sponge) and goes on your skin more evenly, and you have more control over how much you</li>
            <li>I got in love with them right away</li>
            <li>The company is also very thorough and they send a description on how to use the brush and how to clean properly with some great tips!  </li>
            <li>The bags for the smaller brushes are also very nice.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping and easy package tracking.  </li>
            <li>so I think I&#x27;m pretty good at spotting a high quality brush &amp; Beauty junkees for the bill.</li>
            <li>The bag is really cute and such a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>but before I even received them Beauty Junkees sent me an email about how to clean &amp; care for the brushes along with suggestions on how to use each brush</li>
            <li>Have the large Kabuki brushes too, and they work better.</li>
            <li>I love the canister for the large kabuki brushes.  </li>
            <li>and today I received my order of the full set.</li>
            <li>Regardless, the set is super nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the box it came with, I actually use it when I travel and carry more brushes.</li>
            <li>Super soft bristles and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>brushes come in a black zipper pouch which is very handy</li>
            <li>/&gt;They seem to be very well constructed and are not at all cheap looking.</li>
            <li>I can see myself taking this set with me when I travel next time and knowing my nice brushes will be protected at all time.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about Beauty Junkees &amp; I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>I get a very nice smooth and even application of foundation with the large kabuki brushes and concealer with the small kabuki brushes.  </li>
            <li>I also really appreciated the email I received as a confirmation after placing my order giving me tips/suggestions on how each brush could be used and how to clean them.  </li>
            <li>I bought some of the brushes of this set, the full set of the large kabuki brushes, as well as the eye makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>Nice long handles, NO hairs to pick off of my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a bunch of different brushes from all price points (everything from drugstore to department store brands to ones ordered online) and these are truly some of the most well-made, useful brushes I have used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;these are not big enough for applying foundation or powder with one go as these are mini size, but these are great for contouring and blending shadows.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If someone does not prefer soft feeling brushes, they are fine.</li>
            <li>They really work well!</li>
            <li>These are the real deal!</li>
            <li>That was my first reaction when I opened the box containing the Kabuki Makeup Brush Set by Beauty Junkees.</li>
            <li>The brushes came apart the first time I used them.  </li>
            <li>Not 1 brush hair came loose &amp; they washed &amp; dried beautifully!</li>
            <li>I use it for other brushes that I own as well.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the mini angled flat top kabuki.  </li>
            <li>I have recommended Beauty Junkees to several of my friends as well, as I know they&#x27;d love the quality of these brushes, as well as the very affordable price.</li>
            <li>I have quite a few great brushes in my collection from high end companies, but these are hands down my favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this product, and I would definitely look to get the rest in the future!</li>
            <li>No shedding and the brushes are super soft.  </li>
            <li>I did have a problem with one of the large kabuki brushes, which I think will be a rarity.  </li>
            <li>I am certainly going to recommend this to all of my friends.</li>
            <li>handles are pretty long making it easy to work with the brushes.</li>
            <li>The company is also very helpful regarding tips for cleaning the brushes and using them.</li>
            <li>I ordinarily ordered one brush first and loved how soft it was and ended up ordering the whole set.  </li>
            <li>I really like these brushes.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very sleek looking</li>
            <li>so much</li>
            <li>The brush blended product out very well.</li>
            <li>Shipment was fast.  </li>
            <li>I appreciate the thoughtful design with the regular and mini brushes.</li>
            <li>It really makes a noticeable difference during my makeup application.  </li>
            <li>I was ready to jump on the beauty junkee train</li>
            <li>It actually was presented really nice, in a box like a present.  </li>
            <li>I have a collection of brushes and so far this is the first time I have had them break apart the first time I used them.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much and we will highly recommend to our friends.</li>
            <li>I have more expensive brushes that have lasted me many years.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the brushes, as well as the customer service.</li>
            <li>The zippered pouch that came with the brush set feels like high quality as well.</li>
            <li>i will highly recommend these for beginners.</li>
            <li>This is a great set - my only wish was that one or two of them were a little bit smaller.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with these brushes, after having spent way too much over the years on high priced low quality brushes that shed.  </li>
            <li>The shape of the brushes are precise and sharp.</li>
            <li>The brush itself is half an inch wide, so it&#x27;s quite solid in my hand which is great for precision.</li>
            <li>The brushes are lovely with firm handles and soft bristles that work well.</li>
            <li>the brushes are nicely shaped and the bristles are thick and soft.</li>
            <li>These are very soft.</li>
            <li>I did order a small tapered brush form Beauty Junkees that I love.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be so soft!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>The second reason is many of the brushes can double for the same application.</li>
            <li>These little babies are soft, easy to clean and blend your makeup like none other.</li>
            <li>- I love the size of the brush as it allows you to get to hard to reach places.</li>
            <li>The brush is soft and holds on to the makeup.</li>
            <li>I have the angled brush and it doesn&#x27;t shed and has soft bristles.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are not as soft as I was hoping.  </li>
            <li>Good stuffs sell themselves, can&#x27;t be wrong about that.  </li>
            <li>I only got to use them briefly this morning for the first time, but I was in such a rush.</li>
            <li>this brush set includes- mini Flat Top Brush, mini Angle Brush, mini Flat Angled Brush, mini Tapered Brush, mini Round Brush.</li>
            <li>It has a very dense collection of soft bristles that worked extremely well for putting eyeshadow all over my lid as well as blending.</li>
            <li>The bag is pretty big, plenty of space for other travel makeup.</li>

            <li> Thrilled to find the variety in this set.</li>
            <li> and they have a nice weight to them.</li>
            <li> , I can say look they look nice and feel amazing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are REALLY nice brushes.</li>
            <li> I liked the brush</li>
            <li> These are really nice brushes.  </li>
            <li> I have an obsession with makeup brushes &amp; I love a good deal</li>
            <li> I have tons of makeup brushes from just about every popular brand from luxury to drugstore</li>
            <li> I tugged on the ferrules of each brush &amp; they are on there nice &amp; snug.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i received these for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> They are of excellent quality and overall an amazing value!</li>
            <li> I was so impressed with the high quality of these brushes.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the brush for use of blending under eye concealer but love it for blending in eye primer though I think using your finger is just as effective.</li>
            <li> It was amazing , I love ...</li>
            <li> The brushes are made well, they are extremely soft and they are at a great price!</li>
            <li> amazing brushes kit with cute packaging</li>
            <li> But, the girls at Beauty Junkees were great and helped me out right away.  </li>
            <li> When I have to do my makeup in the car, one side of the canister fits in the cup holder in my car and makes it easy to do my makeup while I&#x27;m traveling (as a passenger!).  </li>
            <li> They are great brushes for a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> That in itself is very important and shows the quality of the business and their products.  </li>
            <li> beautiful thick heads, and a perfect size for every application.</li>
            <li> l love these brushes.</li>
            <li> Overall the brushes are amazing!!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are ok.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love the Travel kit</li>
            <li> I have tried many many many brushes.</li>
            <li> I would like to have seen some skinnier brushes for shadow, eye liner i.e. more variety in brush heads.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush.</li>
            <li> It helps me to apply my makeup so much better than I thought it would.</li>
            <li> This is the second set I ordered; really impressed by the quality.</li>
            <li> Size works great to get real close to your nose area.</li>
            <li> They got here 4 days faster than I was expecting them to, and I can&#x27;t wait to use them :)</li>
            <li> I plan on purchasing more.  </li>
            <li> and she loved it right away and ordered one set herself too.  </li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> Great travel brush set, made from high quality materials and love the travel case.  </li>
            <li> I mainly use it to contour my nose, but would work great for eyes as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great deal for high quality brushes.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re of a nice durable quality, and have good density but really soft bristles.</li>
            <li> I did have a problem with the head coming off, but they sent me another one right away!!  </li>
            <li> I have high end brushes but these brushes are just as good.  </li>
            <li> which, I thought, was very cool &amp; further demonstrates all of the great things I have heard &amp; read about Beauty Junkees.</li>
            <li> When I received the brushes (shipping was really quick!)</li>
            <li> It is a perfect little makeup holder for what I need to touch up at work.</li>
            <li> They can be used for eye shadows and for precise concealing and contouring.  </li>
            <li> Great Brushes at a low price !</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t feel comfortable leaving a review.</li>
            <li> There is nothing cheap about these brushes.</li>
            <li> It helps to smooth out things.</li>
            <li> Thank you for such great service.  </li>
            <li> They are slightly bigger than I imagined, but still really great.</li>
            <li> However, in the time that I had, they worked fantastic.</li>
            <li> The brushes feel comfortable when u are using them.</li>
            <li> The benefit to brushes over sponges is that the product you are applying is sort of &amp;#34;absorbed&amp;#34; by the bristles of the brush (as opposed to sitting on the surface of the sponge) and goes on your skin more evenly, and you have more control over how much you</li>
            <li> I got in love with them right away</li>
            <li> The company is also very thorough and they send a description on how to use the brush and how to clean properly with some great tips!  </li>
            <li> The bags for the smaller brushes are also very nice.  </li>
            <li> Quick shipping and easy package tracking.  </li>
            <li> so I think I&#x27;m pretty good at spotting a high quality brush &amp; Beauty junkees for the bill.</li>
            <li> The bag is really cute and such a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> but before I even received them Beauty Junkees sent me an email about how to clean &amp; care for the brushes along with suggestions on how to use each brush</li>
            <li> Have the large Kabuki brushes too, and they work better.</li>
            <li> I love the canister for the large kabuki brushes.  </li>
            <li> and today I received my order of the full set.</li>
            <li> Regardless, the set is super nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the box it came with, I actually use it when I travel and carry more brushes.</li>
            <li> Super soft bristles and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> brushes come in a black zipper pouch which is very handy</li>
            <li> /&gt;They seem to be very well constructed and are not at all cheap looking.</li>
            <li> I can see myself taking this set with me when I travel next time and knowing my nice brushes will be protected at all time.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about Beauty Junkees &amp; I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> I get a very nice smooth and even application of foundation with the large kabuki brushes and concealer with the small kabuki brushes.  </li>
            <li> I also really appreciated the email I received as a confirmation after placing my order giving me tips/suggestions on how each brush could be used and how to clean them.  </li>
            <li> I bought some of the brushes of this set, the full set of the large kabuki brushes, as well as the eye makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> Nice long handles, NO hairs to pick off of my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a bunch of different brushes from all price points (everything from drugstore to department store brands to ones ordered online) and these are truly some of the most well-made, useful brushes I have used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;these are not big enough for applying foundation or powder with one go as these are mini size, but these are great for contouring and blending shadows.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If someone does not prefer soft feeling brushes, they are fine.</li>
            <li> They really work well!</li>
            <li> These are the real deal!</li>
            <li> That was my first reaction when I opened the box containing the Kabuki Makeup Brush Set by Beauty Junkees.</li>
            <li> The brushes came apart the first time I used them.  </li>
            <li> Not 1 brush hair came loose &amp; they washed &amp; dried beautifully!</li>
            <li> I use it for other brushes that I own as well.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the mini angled flat top kabuki.  </li>
            <li> I have recommended Beauty Junkees to several of my friends as well, as I know they&#x27;d love the quality of these brushes, as well as the very affordable price.</li>
            <li> I have quite a few great brushes in my collection from high end companies, but these are hands down my favorite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product, and I would definitely look to get the rest in the future!</li>
            <li> No shedding and the brushes are super soft.  </li>
            <li> I did have a problem with one of the large kabuki brushes, which I think will be a rarity.  </li>
            <li> I am certainly going to recommend this to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> handles are pretty long making it easy to work with the brushes.</li>
            <li> The company is also very helpful regarding tips for cleaning the brushes and using them.</li>
            <li> I ordinarily ordered one brush first and loved how soft it was and ended up ordering the whole set.  </li>
            <li> I really like these brushes.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very sleek looking</li>
            <li> so much</li>
            <li> The brush blended product out very well.</li>
            <li> Shipment was fast.  </li>
            <li> I appreciate the thoughtful design with the regular and mini brushes.</li>
            <li> It really makes a noticeable difference during my makeup application.  </li>
            <li> I was ready to jump on the beauty junkee train</li>
            <li> It actually was presented really nice, in a box like a present.  </li>
            <li> I have a collection of brushes and so far this is the first time I have had them break apart the first time I used them.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much and we will highly recommend to our friends.</li>
            <li> I have more expensive brushes that have lasted me many years.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the brushes, as well as the customer service.</li>
            <li> The zippered pouch that came with the brush set feels like high quality as well.</li>
            <li> i will highly recommend these for beginners.</li>
            <li> This is a great set - my only wish was that one or two of them were a little bit smaller.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with these brushes, after having spent way too much over the years on high priced low quality brushes that shed.  </li>
            <li> The shape of the brushes are precise and sharp.</li>
            <li> The brush itself is half an inch wide, so it&#x27;s quite solid in my hand which is great for precision.</li>
            <li> The brushes are lovely with firm handles and soft bristles that work well.</li>
            <li> the brushes are nicely shaped and the bristles are thick and soft.</li>
            <li> These are very soft.</li>
            <li> I did order a small tapered brush form Beauty Junkees that I love.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be so soft!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> The second reason is many of the brushes can double for the same application.</li>
            <li> These little babies are soft, easy to clean and blend your makeup like none other.</li>
            <li> - I love the size of the brush as it allows you to get to hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> The brush is soft and holds on to the makeup.</li>
            <li> I have the angled brush and it doesn&#x27;t shed and has soft bristles.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are not as soft as I was hoping.  </li>
            <li> Good stuffs sell themselves, can&#x27;t be wrong about that.  </li>
            <li> I only got to use them briefly this morning for the first time, but I was in such a rush.</li>
            <li> this brush set includes- mini Flat Top Brush, mini Angle Brush, mini Flat Angled Brush, mini Tapered Brush, mini Round Brush.</li>
            <li> It has a very dense collection of soft bristles that worked extremely well for putting eyeshadow all over my lid as well as blending.</li>
            <li> The bag is pretty big, plenty of space for other travel makeup.</li>
            <li> In comparison to other popular and expensive brushes that I have, I find that I always reach for my Beauty Junkees brushes instead.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately today I received my second brush (The round top mini kabuki) and the brush was completely separated from the handle - wah wah wah - end result</li>
            <li> I ordered the flat kabuki brush .</li>
            <li> They are dry by the next day.  </li>
            <li> far as quality, these brushes have not shed at all, and the ferrules are tightly attached to the brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes are each about 7 inches long.</li>
            <li> The bristles are firm and well put together, but yet soft on the eyes.</li>
            <li> I was curious to check them out further.</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes and received them sooo fast, which is a huge plus because I hate waiting.</li>
            <li> However, the case is 9 inches wide with a 3 inch circumference.</li>
            <li> so when I saw Beauty Junkees brushes being used in a few makeup tutorials on YouTube</li>
            <li> and i keep my brushes along with a few emergency makeup stuff and carry it in my purse.</li>
            <li> The black wooden handles &amp; copper ferrules give a sleek, expensive feeling to the brushes along with the name of each brush &amp; the Beauty Junkees logo printed on each handle.</li>
            <li> Compare that to what I took on vacation recently, thin handled brushes with a flat case that took up hardly any room.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if this happens to everyone, but after I washed a few of the brushes, the bristles became very stiff.</li>
            <li> It comes with a round hard travel case</li>
            <li> not sure if this is because of the stiffness of the brush</li>
            <li> I usually buy sigma brushes but after seeing a lot about these brushes I decided to give it a try</li>
            <li> the bristles are thick and nice.&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li> However Im giving it four instead of 5 because one of my brushes came broken.</li>
            <li> or maybe I just got a bad set of brushes?</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed with your purchase!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> l love these brushes. One week ago I went to my friend&#x27;s house and she used them when applying make up on me. I got in love with them right away and today I received my order of the full set. I couldn&#x27;t be more happy!!</li>
            <li> Great brushes. Beauty Junkees make up brush set along with their kabuki brushes are amazing. The company is also very helpful regarding tips for cleaning the brushes and using them.</li>
            <li> Very nice set of quality brushes, and the case is perfect for protecting your brushes while traveling.</li>
            <li> These are very soft. I wash them after every use and they have not shed at all.  They are dry by the next day.  They can be used for eye shadows and for precise concealing and contouring.  Highly recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li> I ordinarily ordered one brush first and loved how soft it was and ended up ordering the whole set.  It comes with a round hard travel case and I like how it protects he brushes.  I use it for other brushes that I own as well.  I did have a problem with the head coming off, but they sent me another one right away!!  Excellent customer service!!!</li>
            <li> Overall the brushes are amazing!!! The cup is also. However Im giving it four instead of 5 because one of my brushes came broken.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these brushes!  No shedding.</li>
            <li> I bought these as a gift but Im definitely buying one set for me. The cup is beautifull y and practical</li>
            <li> Great Brushes at a low price !</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the brush for use of blending under eye concealer but love it for blending in eye primer though I think using your finger is just as effective.</li>
            <li> Great travel brush set, made from high quality materials and love the travel case.  I can see myself taking this set with me when I travel next time and knowing my nice brushes will be protected at all time. Showed my co-worker this set at work and she loved it right away and ordered one set herself too.  Good stuffs sell themselves, can&#x27;t be wrong about that.  Thank you and have a nice day.</li>
            <li> These brushes are ok. Have the large Kabuki brushes too, and they work better. Not sure if this happens to everyone, but after I washed a few of the brushes, the bristles became very stiff. The only way to correct/soften the bristle is to use my fingers or palm to rub out the stiffness. Also, it doesnt seem to blend the eye shadow well... not sure if this is because of the stiffness of the brush or maybe I just got a bad set of brushes?</li>
            <li> Thrilled to find the variety in this set.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes. They&#x27;re of a nice durable quality, and have good density but really soft bristles. And the case that came with them had plenty of room for these brushes as well as room for others which will be great for travel.  I also really appreciated the email I received as a confirmation after placing my order giving me tips/suggestions on how each brush could be used and how to clean them.  This is a great set - my only wish was that one or two of them were a little bit smaller.</li>
            <li> These brushes are magical! I was on the lookout for a brush set that could meet all of my beauty needs when I stumbled upon this set from Beauty Junkees. After reading through the reviews, I decided to purchase a set and I&#x27;m so glad I did. These little babies are soft, easy to clean and blend your makeup like none other. I&#x27;ve used them for everything -- blending out foundation, contouring, concealing, you name it. They&#x27;re the perfect size to get under your eyes and around your nose, but they&#x27;re perfect for using them all over your face. They&#x27;re very sleek looking and they have a nice weight to them. The bag is really cute and such a nice bonus. For the price, you can&#x27;t beat the quality of this brush set. You won&#x27;t regret buying these.</li>
            <li> Item as described.  Quick shipping and easy package tracking.  Brush seems to be good quality.  I am using to apply concealer.  It does the job.</li>
            <li> I bought some of the brushes of this set, the full set of the large kabuki brushes, as well as the eye makeup brushes. Talk about amazing! I have quite a few great brushes in my collection from high end companies, but these are hands down my favorite. Their texture is the best for a smooth application, and the length perfect. I love the Travel kit so much I ordered a couple more!</li>
            <li> I ordered the flat kabuki brush . It was amazing , I love ...</li>
            <li> I purchased all three sets of brushes from Beauty Junkees.  They are great brushes for a very reasonable price.  I now have a brush for anything I want to do and more!  I have more expensive brushes that have lasted me many years.  These brushes seem to be of the same quality.  I get a very nice smooth and even application of foundation with the large kabuki brushes and concealer with the small kabuki brushes.  The shadow brushes also work great.  I did have a problem with one of the large kabuki brushes, which I think will be a rarity.  But, the girls at Beauty Junkees were great and helped me out right away.  I love the canister for the large kabuki brushes.  When I have to do my makeup in the car, one side of the canister fits in the cup holder in my car and makes it easy to do my makeup while I&#x27;m traveling (as a passenger!).  The bags for the smaller brushes are also very nice.  Their customer service whether it&#x27;s for questions or an issue is excellent.  That in itself is very important and shows the quality of the business and their products.  Give them a try, you won&#x27;t be dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recall receiving these brushes or this bag....so I don&#x27;t feel comfortable leaving a review. I did order a small tapered brush form Beauty Junkees that I love.</li>
            <li> Although I can&#x27;t comment on the performance of these brushes, because they just arrived and I have not put them to use yet, I can say look they look nice and feel amazing.&lt;br /&gt;They seem to be very well constructed and are not at all cheap looking.</li>
            <li> These are REALLY nice brushes. They really work well! I&#x27;ve used a bunch of different brushes from all price points (everything from drugstore to department store brands to ones ordered online) and these are truly some of the most well-made, useful brushes I have used. The benefit to brushes over sponges is that the product you are applying is sort of &amp;#34;absorbed&amp;#34; by the bristles of the brush (as opposed to sitting on the surface of the sponge) and goes on your skin more evenly, and you have more control over how much you apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as quality, these brushes have not shed at all, and the ferrules are tightly attached to the brushes. The brushes themselves are super-soft, but have excellent &amp;#34;bounce back&amp;#34;, and even after using over and over they are still in perfect shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Another winner from Beauty Junkees! I adore this brush and this company!</li>
            <li> I have tried many many many brushes. These brushes pass all of my requirements. Nice long handles, NO hairs to pick off of my face. beautiful thick heads, and a perfect size for every application. Do not be fooled by the seemingly unrealistically low price. There is nothing cheap about these brushes. These are the real deal!</li>
            <li> The brush blended product out very well. It works perfect for blending out bronzer on your nose for contouring and also for getting that precise line when your carving out your cheekbones. It could be softer but all in all it worked great.  I&#x27;ve washed it and spot cleaned it and it held its shape well. I don&#x27;t know if it will hold up to multiple washing like sigma cant but that&#x27;s  not a problem if your not a pro. All in all it&#x27;s good for the price it gets the job done. 💙😄✌️</li>
            <li> I received the Tapered Kabuki brush from Beauty Junkees as part of their $1 promotion. I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be so soft! It has a very dense collection of soft bristles that worked extremely well for putting eyeshadow all over my lid as well as blending. The brush itself is half an inch wide, so it&#x27;s quite solid in my hand which is great for precision. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product, and I would definitely look to get the rest in the future!</li>
            <li> I liked the brush and I use it for putting on concealor. It helps to smooth out things.</li>
            <li> Wow! That was my first reaction when I opened the box containing the Kabuki Makeup Brush Set by Beauty Junkees. This product has quality written all over it. The brushes are lovely with firm handles and soft bristles that work well. It comes with a holder that snaps apart to be used as two cups to hold the brushes and it snaps together for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why 4 stars instead of 5? There are two reasons I gave this kit 4 instead of 5 stars. The first is it is advertised as a mini kit and perfect for travel. However, the case is 9 inches wide with a 3 inch circumference. The brushes are each about 7 inches long. Compare that to what I took on vacation recently, thin handled brushes with a flat case that took up hardly any room.  The second reason is many of the brushes can double for the same application. I would like to have seen some skinnier brushes for shadow, eye liner i.e. more variety in brush heads. Regardless, the set is super nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of travel I will use these brushes at home. They are of excellent quality and overall an amazing value!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. Great quality and excellent customer service. Can&#x27;t imagine purchasing from anyone else in the future. Super soft bristles and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Shipment was fast.  It actually was presented really nice, in a box like a present.  These are really nice brushes.  I like to use them for undereye concealer.  I am still playing with them to see what I can do with them.  Love the box it came with, I actually use it when I travel and carry more brushes.</li>
            <li> These are great!!!! I am in love with these brushes!!!</li>
            <li> These are with out a doubt the best brushes. They have dense fibers that perform well in creating a flawless look. I appreciate the thoughtful design with the regular and mini brushes. The brush holder is a great bonus.</li>
            <li> Christmas gift for granddaughter.  She loves it!</li>
            <li> This is a perfect brush. I loved it</li>
            <li> Great Price! I wanted a nice but inexpensive set of synthetic brushes and these is perfect!</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes I am thrilled with these</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with these brushes, after having spent way too much over the years on high priced low quality brushes that shed.  These are great for both liquid and powder.  This is my third purchase from Beauty Junkees. I highly recommend the brushes, as well as the customer service. Great price, excellent product.</li>
            <li> Awesome product perfect delivery great follow up. A+++</li>
            <li> Thank you for such great service.  This brush is just the best.  Superior quality just as advertised.  It really makes a noticeable difference during my makeup application.  My skin looks flawless.  I am certainly going to recommend this to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> Great quality makeup brushes.  No shedding and the brushes are super soft.  I have high end brushes but these brushes are just as good.  Good purchase.</li>
            <li> So far so good! Love these brushes. They are slightly bigger than I imagined, but still really great. I only got to use them briefly this morning for the first time, but I was in such a rush. However, in the time that I had, they worked fantastic. The bristles are firm and well put together, but yet soft on the eyes. The bag is pretty big, plenty of space for other travel makeup. It is a perfect little makeup holder for what I need to touch up at work. Very impressed.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush. It helps me to apply my makeup so much better than I thought it would. The brush is soft and holds on to the makeup. I would definitely tell my friends about it.</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes and received them sooo fast, which is a huge plus because I hate waiting. The brushes are made well, they are extremely soft and they are at a great price! My makeup goes on a lot smoother and more effortlessly! These are a must have for anyone on a budget but doesn&#x27;t want to sacrifice quality. Thank you so much and we will highly recommend to our friends.</li>
            <li> This is the second set I ordered; really impressed by the quality.</li>
            <li> I have an obsession with makeup brushes &amp; I love a good deal so when I saw Beauty Junkees brushes being used in a few makeup tutorials on YouTube I was curious to check them out further. I have tons of makeup brushes from just about every popular brand from luxury to drugstore so I think I&#x27;m pretty good at spotting a high quality brush &amp; Beauty junkees for the bill. I ordrred all 3 sets but this review is about the 5 piece mini kabuki brushes with zippered pouch. Once I ordered the brushes but before I even received them Beauty Junkees sent me an email about how to clean &amp; care for the brushes along with suggestions on how to use each brush which, I thought, was very cool &amp; further demonstrates all of the great things I have heard &amp; read about Beauty Junkees. When I received the brushes (shipping was really quick!) I was so impressed with the high quality of these brushes. I pulled on each brush head &amp; there was no shedding at all! Not 1 brush hair came loose &amp; they washed &amp; dried beautifully! I tugged on the ferrules of each brush &amp; they are on there nice &amp; snug. The black wooden handles &amp; copper ferrules give a sleek, expensive feeling to the brushes along with the name of each brush &amp; the Beauty Junkees logo printed on each handle. The brushes feel comfortable when u are using them. The zippered pouch that came with the brush set feels like high quality as well. All in all I am so impressed with every facet from ordering to the product itself! I cannot say enough good things about Beauty Junkees &amp; I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re on the fence as to whether you should get this set or not, buy it!  It&#x27;s a great deal for high quality brushes.  I have the angled brush and it doesn&#x27;t shed and has soft bristles.  In comparison to other popular and expensive brushes that I have, I find that I always reach for my Beauty Junkees brushes instead.  I mainly use it to contour my nose, but would work great for eyes as well. It also works great for concealer and my under eye area.  Size works great to get real close to your nose area. You will not be disappointed with your purchase!</li>
            <li> I got the angled kabuki brush and absolutely love it! I use it for my mineral makeup and love that I can use this instead of my fingers! I have recommended Beauty Junkees to several of my friends as well, as I know they&#x27;d love the quality of these brushes, as well as the very affordable price. Thank you!</li>
            <li> amazing brushes kit with cute packaging</li>
            <li> The brushes came apart the first time I used them.  I have a collection of brushes and so far this is the first time I have had them break apart the first time I used them.</li>
            <li> The brushes are not as soft as I was hoping.  They are of good quality and nicely weighted wood handles.  If someone does not prefer soft feeling brushes, they are fine.</li>
            <li> These brushes look amazing and the bag is great quality as well! They got here 4 days faster than I was expecting them to, and I can&#x27;t wait to use them :)</li>
            <li> Great Brushes!! I love Beauty Junkee Brushes and use them on all makeup applications I do!! they are the best!!</li>
            <li> These are a great pair of make up brushes. i will highly recommend these for beginners. The shape of the brushes are precise and sharp. the bristles are thick and nice.&lt;br /&gt;the handles are pretty long making it easy to work with the brushes. this brush set includes- mini Flat Top Brush, mini Angle Brush, mini Flat Angled Brush, mini Tapered Brush, mini Round Brush. the brushes are nicely shaped and the bristles are thick and soft. They blend well.&lt;br /&gt;these are not big enough for applying foundation or powder with one go as these are mini size, but these are great for contouring and blending shadows.&lt;br /&gt;the brushes come in a black zipper pouch which is very handy and i keep my brushes along with a few emergency makeup stuff and carry it in my purse. these are great.&lt;br /&gt;i received these for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I usually buy sigma brushes but after seeing a lot about these brushes I decided to give it a try and I am so happy I did - I love the size of the brush as it allows you to get to hard to reach places. I purchased the mini angled flat top kabuki.  The brush appears to be of good quality and comparable with my sigma brushes.  I plan on purchasing more.  The company is also very thorough and they send a description on how to use the brush and how to clean properly with some great tips!  UPDATE I was ready to jump on the beauty junkee train but unfortunately today I received my second brush (The round top mini kabuki) and the brush was completely separated from the handle - wah wah wah - end result - you get what you pay for</li>
