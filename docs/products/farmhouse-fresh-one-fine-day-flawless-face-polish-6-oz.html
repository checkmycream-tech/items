            <li>This stuff is amazing!  </li>
            <li>It smells good, it lasts forever, and does a great job exfoliating.</li>
            <li>A nice addition, to my face product bundle!</li>
            <li>Since I have tried FHF products before and LOVED them, I thought I&#x27;d try.</li>
            <li>If it didn&#x27;t work so well and leave my skin feeling so good</li>
            <li>It is the best; After I remove my makeup I use this to wash my face and the feeling I get after is so smooth.</li>
            <li>However, I loved the consistency and the way it made my skin feel.</li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>That is until I scrub it good with this product.</li>
            <li>People have said the smell isn&#x27;t so good, but it smells lovely!</li>
            <li>Love the way this smells, feels great after use.</li>
            <li>This is a surprising product -- well-packaged, effective, with no overpowering smells or residue.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to trying more of their stuff!</li>
            <li>Oh, bonus, it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>when I&#x27;m ready for bed and it does remove dirt perfectly...</li>
            <li>Nice exfoliator.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t rate anything 5 star unless it&#x27;s deserving.</li>
            <li>Very happy with this product, it really is gentle on the skin, and the Shea butter helps to moisturizer the skin.</li>
            <li>but it really doesn&#x27;t smell very good.</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned, with light hair and hazel eyes.</li>
            <li>Smells great and leaves my skin feeling super smooth.</li>
            <li>I liked one fine day</li>
            <li>By letting the scrub sit on my face, the Shea oil is able to pull the impurities out of my skin.</li>
            <li>Love it and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>This is THE BEST facial scrub polish I have used to date.  </li>
            <li>It has no paraben, so it is SO REFRESHING when I wash it off, I&#x27;m left with perfect skin that doesn&#x27;t feel waxy.  </li>
            <li>and I have found my face gets flaky feeling more often.</li>
            <li>even more so while I am nursing)</li>
            <li>My clients love</li>
            <li>and I absolutely LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just in love with this product,  </li>
            <li>What I love most about this scrub is that it is incredibly fine as well as moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Now IF the Farmhouse Fresh Company would like to send me their FULL line to review - I&#x27;d be very happy to &amp;#34;help out&amp;#34;, but only with my honest opinion.   </li>
            <li>it works well, got rid of a lot of dry skin that I have during these winter months, but honestly the smell isn&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best face product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>It is fine</li>
            <li>It literally smells like a cheap candle.</li>
            <li>Not overly abrasive, sweeps away dead skin cells and smells incredible!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of facial scrubs and this product is  literally the top one!!</li>
            <li>I will definitely get more when I run out! :)</li>
            <li>Like a sweet smell</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>The scrub is gentle and leaves my skin feeling smooth and smelling yummy!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s sweet aroma of sugar, vanilla and citrus when I have them under the steamer machine.</li>
            <li>pretty good product and not too coarse or fine.  </li>
            <li>If your skin is super flaky, this will remove maybe 40% but not 85-95% like a peel would.  </li>
            <li>but once you work it into your face and create heat it gets creamy and easy to work with… it also does not smell like shea butter but more like lemon, to me at least. :) !</li>
            <li>I first purchased this product at a spa and came to Amazon once I ran out!</li>
            <li>The price was right and it was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I want this company to stay in business for a LONG time as I plan to continue to use this wonderful product for as long as I can get my hands on it...</li>
            <li>I love that its naturally based.</li>
            <li>I was expecting to open the jar and just fall in love with the scent with the way people described it</li>
            <li>I love that you can scrub your face moderately and get moisture from the product too.</li>
            <li>Be careful not to use it with a clarisonic or similar, because you will be hurting afterwards, it is plenty powerful on its own!</li>
            <li>I get my face wet with warm water, then I spread the scrub all over, gently scrubbing.</li>
            <li>Item came pretty fast but item was damaged.</li>
            <li>My skin is left extremely smooth (now, if I could just find something to take care of the crepey appearance I&#x27;d be that much happier!)</li>
            <li>This is a luxurious indulgence in a VERY high quality product.  </li>
            <li>it really makes the skin soft and fresh</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that the tiny light brown spots that use to be on my hands are gone.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I leave it on my face for a few minutes and then rinse with warm water.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
            <li>I love the little jar it comes in, but I do wish it had a plastic cap because of moisture.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin SO soft and smells divine!!</li>
            <li>I used it only one time so far and it instantly made my skin feel hydrated and smooth!</li>
            <li>I love that it comes in a jar because I can get out all of the product and not waste product or money when its near empty.</li>
            <li>I actually wanted to use it again right after because it made my skin feel so refreshed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I live in AZ now</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin (</li>
            <li>It makes my skin soft and keeps my skin clear!!</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling so soft and hydrated!</li>
            <li>I have acne prone, sensitive skin</li>
            <li>maybe I got an old batch?</li>
            <li>This was not only incredibly gentle on my skin, but did not try it out one bit.</li>
            <li>I include this info because it explains just how sensitive my skin can be.  </li>
            <li>Most face scrubs I&#x27;ve encountered have too big of particles, and makes my sensitive skin too tight after washing, as well as red.</li>
            <li>I like to apply the scrub to my wet face when I first get in the shower  and leave it on for the duration.</li>
            <li>I have seasonal skin, where it gets very oily in the summer and extremely dry in the winter (to the point of flaking)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to give one of their other scents a try.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and kinda dry</li>
            <li>but I seriously look forward to this One Fine Day Facial Polish each and everytime I use it.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin clear without making it dry!</li>

            <li> This stuff lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> You only need a tiny amount, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t make it even dry or anything</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I actually wasn&#x27;t crazy about the scent - kind of old and stale....</li>
            <li> This stuff will last me forever, I use so little every time.  </li>
            <li> I only use it about once a week, I don&#x27;t think I would want to exfoliate my face everyday.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing left behind except hydrated soft skin.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> planning to try other products from FarmHouse</li>
            <li> So I usually end up using it only in the mornings.</li>
            <li> it is hard to get the last bit of it!</li>
            <li> It takes very little to go a LONG way.  </li>
            <li> so I was abit skeptical in trying it, but my face has responded really well to it.</li>
            <li> Then it&#x27;s back to baby skin for at least 5 days.</li>
            <li> My skin feels &amp;#34;naturally cared for&amp;#34; with no burning or raw feeling after each use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a HARD sell.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint!!!!</li>
            <li> It very thick and pasty when you put in on</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m terrible about following a skincare regime.  </li>
            <li> Try this you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Forget the awful chemicals!</li>

            <li> I was so worried that this stuff would make me break out since I have combination skin. Since I have tried FHF products before and LOVED them, I thought I&#x27;d try. I thought it was going to leave my skin oily, but quite the contrary! It does not leave skin oily or greasy at all! I only use it about once a week, I don&#x27;t think I would want to exfoliate my face everyday. Maybe at max 2 times a week. I do feel like this has evened out my skin tone a lot! I get my face wet with warm water, then I spread the scrub all over, gently scrubbing. I leave it on my face for a few minutes and then rinse with warm water. The best use is in the shower. This stuff will last me forever, I use so little every time.  I love the little jar it comes in, but I do wish it had a plastic cap because of moisture.</li>
            <li> Recommended..Excellent scrub..planning to try other products from FarmHouse</li>
            <li> This is a surprising product -- well-packaged, effective, with no overpowering smells or residue. Very nice stuff.</li>
            <li> it works well, got rid of a lot of dry skin that I have during these winter months, but honestly the smell isn&#x27;t that great. It literally smells like a cheap candle. I was expecting to open the jar and just fall in love with the scent with the way people described it but it really doesn&#x27;t smell very good. If it didn&#x27;t work so well and leave my skin feeling so good I wouldn&#x27;t use it</li>
            <li> I LOVE this! It is the best; After I remove my makeup I use this to wash my face and the feeling I get after is so smooth. People have said the smell isn&#x27;t so good, but it smells lovely! Like a sweet smell (you also get used to the smell after awhile) I have acne prone, sensitive skin so I was abit skeptical in trying it, but my face has responded really well to it. My breakouts have lessened. I scrub and massage my face with this daily in the morning before I start my day and in the evening when I&#x27;m ready for bed and it does remove dirt perfectly...I HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I actually wasn&#x27;t crazy about the scent - kind of old and stale....maybe I got an old batch? However, I loved the consistency and the way it made my skin feel. I&#x27;m willing to give one of their other scents a try.</li>
            <li> This scrub is wonderful. It smells good, it lasts forever, and does a great job exfoliating. I use it 2-3 x per week on my face and neck. A little goes a long way. Be careful not to use it with a clarisonic or similar, because you will be hurting afterwards, it is plenty powerful on its own!</li>
            <li> pretty good product and not too coarse or fine.  I use it on the T zone every day.</li>
            <li> AMAZING!!! I have acne-prone oily skin and this product works wonders! It makes my skin soft and keeps my skin clear!! I first purchased this product at a spa and came to Amazon once I ran out! I am already on my 3rd jar! I alternate between this and a benzyl peroxide- containing cleanser daily. I use the benzyl peroxide cleanser at night and this one when I&#x27;m in the shower. I like to apply the scrub to my wet face when I first get in the shower  and leave it on for the duration. By letting the scrub sit on my face, the Shea oil is able to pull the impurities out of my skin. Again, this product is AMAZING! It keeps my skin clear without making it dry! LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I used it only one time so far and it instantly made my skin feel hydrated and smooth! I have seasonal skin, where it gets very oily in the summer and extremely dry in the winter (to the point of flaking) so I decided to buy this for the winter months. It very thick and pasty when you put in on but once you work it into your face and create heat it gets creamy and easy to work with… it also does not smell like shea butter but more like lemon, to me at least. :) !</li>
            <li> It is very beautiful and amazing results</li>
            <li> It smells delicious.  It is fine so it doesn&#x27;t hurt your face as you are using it.  It helps to exfoliate your face and neck! It will last a while because you don&#x27;t need a lot at one time.</li>
            <li> This face wash is the best face wash I have ever used.  It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  The price was right and it was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> What I love most about this scrub is that it is incredibly fine as well as moisturizing. Most face scrubs I&#x27;ve encountered have too big of particles, and makes my sensitive skin too tight after washing, as well as red. This was not only incredibly gentle on my skin, but did not try it out one bit. Oh, bonus, it smells amazing. I actually wanted to use it again right after because it made my skin feel so refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing my face with a cleansing gel at night, I applied this to my face in circles, washed off, and I *almost* didn&#x27;t even need moisturizer (but at 32, I need my wrinkle cream!) Love it and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Bought for my mom actually she recommends it ..</li>
            <li> Not enough granules to feel like a scrub</li>
            <li> Nice exfoliator. Smells good. Skin feels softer after use.</li>
            <li> this is the best scrub i ever used. I scrub and massage my face with this daily in the evening because its remove all the makeup. its smell so yummy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a HARD sell.  I don&#x27;t rate anything 5 star unless it&#x27;s deserving. This is THE BEST facial scrub polish I have used to date.  I am fair skinned, with light hair and hazel eyes. I include this info because it explains just how sensitive my skin can be.  This is a luxurious indulgence in a VERY high quality product.  It takes very little to go a LONG way.  It has no paraben, so it is SO REFRESHING when I wash it off, I&#x27;m left with perfect skin that doesn&#x27;t feel waxy.  There&#x27;s nothing left behind except hydrated soft skin.  My skin feels &amp;#34;naturally cared for&amp;#34; with no burning or raw feeling after each use.  I use it one to two times per week. I&#x27;m terrible about following a skincare regime.  I feel it&#x27;s a necesarry PITA (pain in the a$$) but I seriously look forward to this One Fine Day Facial Polish each and everytime I use it. I want this company to stay in business for a LONG time as I plan to continue to use this wonderful product for as long as I can get my hands on it...speaking of hands - I use it on the tops of my hands everytime I use it on my face.  I&#x27;ve noticed that the tiny light brown spots that use to be on my hands are gone.  Totally disappeared.  My skin is left extremely smooth (now, if I could just find something to take care of the crepey appearance I&#x27;d be that much happier!) I&#x27;m an RN.  I am NOT paid by anyone to write my reviews.  Now IF the Farmhouse Fresh Company would like to send me their FULL line to review - I&#x27;d be very happy to &amp;#34;help out&amp;#34;, but only with my honest opinion.   Update 11/18/2015: just finishing my jar I purchased in 1/2013. I use it once a week on my face. This stuff lasts a long time. I&#x27;m purchasing another jar today. I live in AZ now and I have found my face gets flaky feeling more often. That is until I scrub it good with this product. Then it&#x27;s back to baby skin for at least 5 days. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> Best scrub ever. Makes your skin SO soft and smells divine!!</li>
            <li> Love the way this smells, feels great after use. But it&#x27;s a bit tricky to lather and get my make up off. So I usually end up using it only in the mornings.</li>
            <li> I love that you can scrub your face moderately and get moisture from the product too. It&#x27;s like a waxy balm with medium sized grains of sugar mixed inside. It&#x27;s not an intense scrub but its not a light scrub either. If your skin is super flaky, this will remove maybe 40% but not 85-95% like a peel would.  I love that it comes in a jar because I can get out all of the product and not waste product or money when its near empty. Also I can recycle the jar by putting Q-tops, cotton balls, bobby pins or whatever inside after all the scrub is gone.</li>
            <li> Smells delicious and works great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of facial scrubs and this product is  literally the top one!! My skin is very sensitive and kinda dry but it doesn&#x27;t make it even dry or anything</li>
            <li> Try this you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin (even more so while I am nursing) and this has been incredible. I use it in the shower and as a regular face wash. Smells great and leaves my skin feeling super smooth.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  The scrub is gentle and leaves my skin feeling smooth and smelling yummy!  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Hands down the best face product I have ever used.  And I suffer from acne and pcos. Forget the awful chemicals!</li>
            <li> Excellent and practical thank the seller</li>
            <li> I am an Esthetician. This product is a joy to work with. Not overly abrasive, sweeps away dead skin cells and smells incredible! My clients love it&#x27;s sweet aroma of sugar, vanilla and citrus when I have them under the steamer machine. It loosens blackheads and brightens the look of the skin. I love that its naturally based. You only need a tiny amount, a little goes a long way. I will definitely get more when I run out! :)</li>
            <li> I buy this from my spa and I absolutely LOVE it.  It leaves your skin feeling so soft and hydrated! I&#x27;m just in love with this product,  I&#x27;m looking forward to trying more of their stuff!</li>
            <li> Item came pretty fast but item was damaged.</li>
            <li> The shea butter cream of Whoopie pie scent is so good.&lt;br /&gt;I buy two jars of this for after the shower and two tubes of this every two months for my purse.&lt;br /&gt;I only wish the makers would supply a spoon of some sort for the jar of the Whoopie Pies cream&lt;br /&gt;because it is hard to get the last bit of it! My only complaint!!!!</li>
            <li> I liked one fine day it really makes the skin soft and fresh</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product, it really is gentle on the skin, and the Shea butter helps to moisturizer the skin. A nice addition, to my face product bundle!</li>
