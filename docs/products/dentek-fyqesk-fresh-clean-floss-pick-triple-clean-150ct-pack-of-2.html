            <li>/&gt;It works great</li>
            <li>great value and good quality.</li>
            <li>Not terrible but not the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>Good staff.</li>
            <li>and you will be happy with these kind as well.</li>
            <li>A DAY IS GOOD PRACTICE.  </li>
            <li>If made by cotton will perfect, but it still worth by that price.</li>
            <li>Fit great between teeth.</li>
            <li>It slips in between your teeth nicely.  </li>
            <li>Very handy for after dinner when you do not have access to a toothbrush and need a quick cleanup.</li>
            <li>The CVS brand are by far the best I have found.</li>
            <li>Floss is the plastic tape kind that brakes easily, and in my opinion, doesn&#x27;t get all of the food out of your teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li>I love this floss picks</li>
            <li>I struggle to understand how these ever came to market in a world that has so many better products.</li>
            <li>These have been my favorite flowers for quite some time so buying them this way is the way to go.</li>
            <li>Ordered a package which cost more than retail store but saved me trip.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Better and safer than toothpicks.</li>
            <li>These are our favorite.</li>
            <li>I love dentek</li>
            <li>Personally, I&#x27;d love to find these with woven floss.</li>
            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t love dental hygiene?</li>
            <li>I use these 3+ times a day, love the built in tongue scraper.</li>
            <li>Better reports from the dentist.</li>
            <li>The DenTek Comfort Clean Floss is okay.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These will clean your teeth, but require a lot more effort than the Plackers.  </li>
            <li>the floss stretches and breaks too easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>strong and effective.&lt;br /&gt;love</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re cheap</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, nice product, everything came as they describe it.</li>
            <li>But at the end of the day, my teeth feel clean and that&#x27;s all that matters.&lt;br</li>
            <li>clean floss picks were shipped in a timely fashion.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as the last pack I bought in a store (I can&#x27;t remember what brand they were).</li>
            <li>but DenTek Comfort Clean Silky floss is the only floss that I liked</li>
            <li>They do get the job done and are easy on my gums so I really like them.</li>
            <li>Well Protected Packaging, Arrived On-Time, Worth The Price, Recommend This Product, And Will Use This Supplier Again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried different kind of floss and floss picks</li>
            <li>The flosses that I buy have a fresh mint flavor on it and are coated with fluoride.</li>
            <li>I could exchange for the right product.  </li>
            <li>tongue scrapper part is pretty darn useful though and is on both sides of the floss, so it doesn&#x27;t matter which side you use.</li>
            <li>While traveling I do not have to carry my tongue cleaner with me as the tongue scraper option is an added feature in this floss picks which I like very much.</li>
            <li>I will buy these again until I can remember what brand my first bag was.</li>
            <li>Love that free shipping with prime for everyday essentials.</li>
            <li>Just basic sturdy plastic with strong floss.</li>
            <li>From the website, the picks are white and I have previously ordered and used these white picks which  were perfect.</li>
            <li>The product is dental floss on a stick which is very convenient for teeth cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Item Was As Advertised, Fast Shipping</li>
            <li>These picks + floss work much betteer</li>
            <li>These work very well and are much handier that using the string.  </li>
            <li>Most likely a case of \\&quot;you get what you pay for,\\&quot; but I typically have to use two picks for each flossing because the first one will snap before I am able to complete the activity.</li>
            <li>It bends really easily now and the floss stretched when trying to floss.  </li>
            <li>Not even sure how other people manage to use them.  </li>
            <li>We have used many other Floss picks.</li>
            <li>What a waste ... need about 10 to floss, breaks very easy when flossing.</li>
            <li>For those with tight teeth, the odds of the piece coming completely loose are pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I like the shape of these flowers and since I have some gum recession I find these reach down farther than many flosses do.</li>
            <li>Also, some types of floss stick on a false cap I have on one of my teeth and these do a nice job of sliding right by it.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend to anyone who likes to floss on the go.  </li>
            <li>They do not break as easily as some other brands.</li>
            <li>After flossing with this picks it leaves a little minty and sweet taste inside the mouth which I like very much.</li>
            <li>the stretch might actually make it easier to pull the floss around the curve of the tooth, if the string does not break first.</li>
            <li>The floss breaks almost instantly and the pick end breaks off in between your teeth within seconds, absolute garbage.</li>
            <li>Regret purchasing such a high quantity and wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li>It is the same as what I normally bought with cheaper price.</li>
            <li>The floss is thick so that it doesn&#x27;t fray easily.  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;floss, making it easy to get between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;The product sent to me has no brush on the tip&lt;br /&gt;and thick floss, which tears out immediately.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>though someone recommended this to me, I was not able to clean my slots using it, so I just returned them....</li>
            <li>Well, apparently, you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Spending a little more for Plackers or other quality brands is money well spent.</li>
            <li>The floss picks are really thin and silky which makes it easy to glide between my teeth without making any effort.</li>

            <li> The floss picks are really thin and silky which makes it easy to glide between my teeth without making any effort.</li>
            <li> I have to use two picks every time I floss and even then the floss part stretches out so much that it becomes hard to use.</li>
            <li> We have been using this product for a long time and was getting tiered to look for it st the market .</li>
            <li> I do not like these blue picks, the floss is not as tight as they are on the  white picks.</li>
            <li> Overall, it makes it harder to floss than other sticks, and you may end up having to use multiples to get the job</li>
            <li> IMO, it&#x27;s not worth the extra effort.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once it stretches, it is more difficult to get between other teeth and does not clean well.  </li>
            <li> On a side note, I&#x27;ve known people that could only use this type of floss because of the tight spaces between their teeth.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;floss&amp;#34; is a thin tape (much like teflon tape) that immediately stretches.  </li>
            <li> They seem fairly thin and go through tight spots pretty well.</li>
            <li> the toothpick end is actually dangerously sharp.</li>
            <li> Because the string isn&#x27;t attached as well to the stick, you end up with a stretched out piece of floss that sort of sags in the middle, making it hard to get into tight spaces between teeth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, these are not worth the cost savings.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately they break too often and the plastic is very flimsy.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit sharp.</li>
            <li> This floss doesn&#x27;t break between tight teeth...</li>
            <li> and I had to use regular floss to get the broken piece out from between teeth.  </li>
            <li> Use these everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say one 1/10 of these breaks after going between a few teeth</li>
            <li> These dont break and i have very tight teeth.  </li>
            <li> Generally after eating meat, pieces of meat get stuck in between my teeth, which is very irritating and unhygienic.</li>
            <li> However, because of that it&#x27;s a little too thick for the space between my teeth</li>
            <li> so it takes me a bit longer than usual to floss.  </li>
            <li> Usually get them at CVS, but don&#x27;t have to leave the comfort of home with Amazon.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is also sad that the quality of these went way down.  </li>
            <li> Hence the poor rating.&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used worse</li>
            <li> I hate mint</li>
            <li> This is the worst I have ever used.  </li>

            <li> The DenTek Comfort Clean Floss is okay.  The floss is thick so that it doesn&#x27;t fray easily.  However, because of that it&#x27;s a little too thick for the space between my teeth so it takes me a bit longer than usual to floss.  But at the end of the day, my teeth feel clean and that&#x27;s all that matters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tongue scrapper part is pretty darn useful though and is on both sides of the floss, so it doesn&#x27;t matter which side you use.</li>
            <li> I  was introduced to this product by my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;The sample has a brush on the tip and thin&lt;br /&gt;floss, making it easy to get between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;The product sent to me has no brush on the tip&lt;br /&gt;and thick floss, which tears out immediately.&lt;br /&gt;I did not receive what I ordered. Hence the poor rating.&lt;br /&gt;Wish I could exchange for the right product.  Bummer.</li>
            <li> The den tek comfort clean floss picks were shipped in a timely fashion.  The product is dental floss on a stick which is very convenient for teeth cleaning.  The shipper sent them to us without delay. I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li> I love this floss picks I can not use anything else. My hubby laughs at me cause he thinks I don&#x27;t know what I want LOL</li>
            <li> This is the worst I have ever used.  Not even sure how other people manage to use them.  The &amp;#34;floss&amp;#34; is a thin tape (much like teflon tape) that immediately stretches.  Once it stretches, it is more difficult to get between other teeth and does not clean well.  On 4 different occasions, the tape broke and I had to use regular floss to get the broken piece out from between teeth.  I struggle to understand how these ever came to market in a world that has so many better products.</li>
            <li> These have been my favorite flowers for quite some time so buying them this way is the way to go. I like the shape of these flowers and since I have some gum recession I find these reach down farther than many flosses do.</li>
            <li> We have been using this product for a long time and was getting tiered to look for it st the market . Ordered a package which cost more than retail store but saved me trip.&lt;br /&gt;It works great</li>
            <li> We picked these up after having used the Plackers floss sticks and liking them.  These were cheaper than the Plackers, and at the time, the thought was \\&quot;How could you screw up floss on a stick?\\&quot;.  Well, apparently, you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These will clean your teeth, but require a lot more effort than the Plackers.  Because the string isn&#x27;t attached as well to the stick, you end up with a stretched out piece of floss that sort of sags in the middle, making it hard to get into tight spaces between teeth.  For those with tight teeth, the odds of the piece coming completely loose are pretty good.  Overall, it makes it harder to floss than other sticks, and you may end up having to use multiples to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, these are not worth the cost savings.  Spending a little more for Plackers or other quality brands is money well spent.</li>
            <li> Item Was As Advertised, Fast Shipping And Well Protected Packaging, Arrived On-Time, Worth The Price, Recommend This Product, And Will Use This Supplier Again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use After Everytime Time I Eat Throughout The Day &amp; Night ... 6 or 7 a day ... Better and safer than toothpicks.</li>
            <li> We have used many other Floss picks. These are our favorite. This floss doesn&#x27;t break between tight teeth... only glides.&lt;br /&gt;Love the Subscribe and save so they show up when we are running low</li>
            <li> Use these everyday. These should last quite awhile. Usually get them at CVS, but don&#x27;t have to leave the comfort of home with Amazon. Love that free shipping with prime for everyday essentials.</li>
            <li> great value and good quality. would highly recommend to anyone who likes to floss on the go.  I love dentek</li>
            <li> Very handy for after dinner when you do not have access to a toothbrush and need a quick cleanup.</li>
            <li> Good staff. Just a little bit sharp. If made by cotton will perfect, but it still worth by that price.</li>
            <li> Not terrible but not the best I&#x27;ve found. Floss is the plastic tape kind that brakes easily, and in my opinion, doesn&#x27;t get all of the food out of your teeth. Regret purchasing such a high quantity and wouldn&#x27;t buy again. On a side note, I&#x27;ve known people that could only use this type of floss because of the tight spaces between their teeth.</li>
            <li> I have tried different kind of floss and floss picks but DenTek Comfort Clean Silky floss is the only floss that I liked and now I use them regularly. The floss picks are really thin and silky which makes it easy to glide between my teeth without making any effort. Generally after eating meat, pieces of meat get stuck in between my teeth, which is very irritating and unhygienic. I try to take them out by brushing but they won’t come out it is when this floss picks comes to my rescue. While traveling I do not have to carry my tongue cleaner with me as the tongue scraper option is an added feature in this floss picks which I like very much. The flosses that I buy have a fresh mint flavor on it and are coated with fluoride. After flossing with this picks it leaves a little minty and sweet taste inside the mouth which I like very much. My husband did not like to floss before, but now he also likes the floss and is using them regularly.</li>
            <li> I received blue picks in place of white picks. I do not like these blue picks, the floss is not as tight as they are on the  white picks. From the website, the picks are white and I have previously ordered and used these white picks which  were perfect. I would have sent them back but I was out and needed them. I will not order them again knowing I might receive blue Picks instead of the White ones.</li>
            <li> It is the same as what I normally bought with cheaper price.</li>
            <li> though someone recommended this to me, I was not able to clean my slots using it, so I just returned them....</li>
            <li> What a waste ... need about 10 to floss, breaks very easy when flossing.</li>
            <li> never could floss until this discovery.&lt;br /&gt;best floss ever.&lt;br /&gt;very strong and effective.&lt;br /&gt;love it and have 3-4 with me all the time...&lt;br /&gt;thanks!</li>
            <li> I get food stuck in my teeth a lot, and flossing doesn&#x27;t always get it. These picks + floss work much betteer</li>
            <li> used up all wifes picks, so ordered your picks, seem like the same, have been using for several years.  Would order again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these before so decided to stock up. The floss is looser in this one than the one I had, but I like anyway.</li>
            <li> The floss breaks almost instantly and the pick end breaks off in between your teeth within seconds, absolute garbage. The CVS brand are by far the best I have found.</li>
            <li> These dont break and i have very tight teeth.  I have no issues at all with these.  I am very happy with these and you will be happy with these kind as well.</li>
            <li> I have to use two picks every time I floss and even then the floss part stretches out so much that it becomes hard to use. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any of them break yet but they do stretch. Not as good as the last pack I bought in a store (I can&#x27;t remember what brand they were). They do get the job done and are easy on my gums so I really like them. I will buy these again until I can remember what brand my first bag was.</li>
            <li> Fit great between teeth.</li>
            <li> These floss sticks get the job done. They are not flavored. Just basic sturdy plastic with strong floss. Personally, I&#x27;d love to find these with woven floss.</li>
            <li> the floss stretches and breaks too easily. the toothpick end is actually dangerously sharp. the stretch might actually make it easier to pull the floss around the curve of the tooth, if the string does not break first.</li>
            <li> It slips in between your teeth nicely.  However, it takes longer to get all the food and stuff out since it slides in between the food and stuff too. IMO, it&#x27;s not worth the extra effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also sad that the quality of these went way down.  It bends really easily now and the floss stretched when trying to floss.  After using these for a while, I&#x27;m looking for a different brand to use.</li>
            <li> mint flavored - I hate mint</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love dental hygiene? I use these 3+ times a day, love the built in tongue scraper. I&#x27;d say one 1/10 of these breaks after going between a few teeth but they&#x27;re cheap so hey. Also, some types of floss stick on a false cap I have on one of my teeth and these do a nice job of sliding right by it.</li>
            <li> BRUSHING AND FLOSSING TWICE A DAY IS GOOD PRACTICE.  THESE FLOSSERS MAKE THINGS SMOOTHER!</li>
            <li> Most likely a case of \\&quot;you get what you pay for,\\&quot; but I typically have to use two picks for each flossing because the first one will snap before I am able to complete the activity.</li>
            <li> They seem fairly thin and go through tight spots pretty well. Unfortunately they break too often and the plastic is very flimsy. I&#x27;ve used worse but I&#x27;ll probably try a different brand next time I need to buy some.</li>
            <li> Works great, great deal!</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Better reports from the dentist.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, nice product, everything came as they describe it.</li>
            <li> These work very well and are much handier that using the string.  They do not break as easily as some other brands.</li>
