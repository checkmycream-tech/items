    <ol>
            <li>I use this product for ballet classes and they work great!</li>
            <li>I use it to achieve the perfect bun.</li>
            <li>works great for my daughters bun for ballet</li>
            <li>and they are great.  </li>
            <li>Great bun nets for the price.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
            <li>The hairnets worked great and were good quality.</li>
            <li>However, you can see the difference and texture which may or may not be good for your dancer.  </li>
            <li>Nice bun cover.</li>
            <li>Very easy for her to fix her hair.  </li>
            <li>Oh I love these.</li>
            <li>maybe directions and more hair would have helped.</li>
            <li>The bun net is a great idea and good deal.</li>
            <li>These are just ok.  </li>
            <li>Very light weighted and comfortable</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t fit over the donut buns at all.</li>
            <li>One fell apart after the first use but the others seem to be okay.</li>
            <li>Had trouble with my order but the seller was great and made sure I received them</li>
            <li>For a really neat chignon or bun, these little hairnets are great!</li>
            <li>it was very nice, elastic enough to fit over my bun and keep the hair inside, in the inconvenience that I only received one the seller was kind enough to find a solution we were both okay with.</li>
            <li>I still use them since the nets are stronger than the other kind of hairnets and won&#x27;t wear or tear like most.</li>
            <li>It was well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>These hairnets couldn&#x27;t fit a new born baby head.  </li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>Exactly what the discription says.</li>
            <li>I order these hairnets thinking it&#x27;ll be big enough to fit over my donut buns for dance but not the best hairnets I have received their pretty small.</li>
            <li>Items look great, but the only problem was I ordered the wrong kind for my kids.</li>
            <li>These bun covers were very inexpensive and did the job.</li>
            <li>Reasonable size.</li>
            <li>They keep my hair very organized.</li>
            <li>For the price I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sturdy and won&#x27;t break easily like other bun nets.  </li>
            <li>The net and the elastic band are separated so many places which creats several holes all the way around.</li>
            <li>Need more stitching band for those who have heavy hair like mine.  </li>
            <li>there won&#x27;t be much stretch to it, but if it&#x27;s too big you can always wrap it.  </li>
            <li>Too small, did not fit all my hair into this tiny net, but then again they were pretty cheap</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Too small, did not fit all my hair into this tiny net, but then again they were pretty cheap</li>
            <li> These work well for small buns, not so much for those with a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> However, if your hair is very long, then it may not have enough space for you bun.</li>
            <li> way smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> The bands/elastics are pretty weak but it can do with a goody elastic.</li>
            <li> These were slow to arrive but they are of extremely high quality and durability.</li>
            <li> The elastic is loose and the netting has no stretch.</li>
            <li> The size seems like it would only work if you had virtually no hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;Totally useless and a huge waste of money!</li>
            <li> Only need to succure with a few bobbypins.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate them but it would have been better if the nets were bigger.</li>
            <li> These are made well, but the elastic is not strong enough to hold the hair inside of them</li>
            <li> Usually I&#x27;d have to re-pin my hair because my hair needs to be in a bun for five hours but with this bun net I don&#x27;t need to!</li>
            <li> Definitely for a small bun and no stretch material.  </li>
            <li> I have other nets and in comparison, this item is not worth to buy.</li>
            <li> I also like that the elastics are tight.</li>
            <li> Only thing is that I find the elastic a bit weak</li>
            <li> Very hard net not easy to put on bun</li>
            <li> They keep all the stray hairs in place and, together with a few well placed hairpins, keep things neat all day.</li>
            <li> Let dancer ones but plain for everyday use.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too small</li>
            <li> I know that I won&#x27;t buy this in the future because the quality is very poor.</li>
            <li> Size of the hairnets was very small</li>
            <li> These are awful!</li>

            <li> These bun covers were very inexpensive and did the job. One fell apart after the first use but the others seem to be okay. For the price I paid I&#x27;m not going to complain.</li>
            <li> Nice bun cover. Reasonable size. However, if your hair is very long, then it may not have enough space for you bun.</li>
            <li> I only received one in the mail it was very nice, elastic enough to fit over my bun and keep the hair inside, in the inconvenience that I only received one the seller was kind enough to find a solution we were both okay with.</li>
            <li> Oh I love these. They keep my hair very organized. Very light weighted and comfortable</li>
            <li> maybe directions and more hair would have helped.</li>
            <li> way smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> I use this product for ballet classes and they work great! I like the netting because it&#x27;s thicker than the bunheads hair nets. Usually I&#x27;d have to re-pin my hair because my hair needs to be in a bun for five hours but with this bun net I don&#x27;t need to!</li>
            <li> Size of the hairnets was very small</li>

            <li> Too small, did not fit all my hair into this tiny net, but then again they were pretty cheap</li>
            <li> works great for my daughters bun for ballet</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sturdy and won&#x27;t break easily like other bun nets.  However, you can see the difference and texture which may or may not be good for your dancer.  Also, the net is basically one size and it it&#x27;s too small there won&#x27;t be much stretch to it, but if it&#x27;s too big you can always wrap it.  The size is about that of a fully wrapped medium donut bun.</li>
            <li> Very hard net not easy to put on bun</li>
            <li> Use it for my daughter at night to go to bed.  Only thing is that I find the elastic a bit weak but it does the job, would buy again.</li>
            <li> I order these hairnets thinking it&#x27;ll be big enough to fit over my donut buns for dance but not the best hairnets I have received their pretty small. It won&#x27;t fit over the donut buns at all. It&#x27;ll only work if you don&#x27;t have a ton of hair on your head. I don&#x27;t hate them but it would have been better if the nets were bigger. I still use them since the nets are stronger than the other kind of hairnets and won&#x27;t wear or tear like most.</li>
            <li> Bough!t these for my mother and they are great.  Very easy for her to fix her hair.  Had trouble with my order but the seller was great and made sure I received them</li>
            <li> Need more stitching band for those who have heavy hair like mine.  After prolong use of this hair bun net, the stitching starts to detached itself from the band. The bun net is a great idea and good deal.</li>
            <li> These are just ok.  For the price I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.  Definitely for a small bun and no stretch material.  If you need one about the size of your palm this might work.</li>
            <li> These work well for small buns, not so much for those with a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> These hairnets couldn&#x27;t fit a new born baby head.  They wouldn&#x27;t even go over my fist.  This was a joke.</li>
            <li> These are awful! The elastic is loose and the netting has no stretch. The size seems like it would only work if you had virtually no hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;Totally useless and a huge waste of money!</li>
            <li> Great bun nets for the price. I use it to achieve the perfect bun. I like it very much. The bands/elastics are pretty weak but it can do with a goody elastic.</li>
            <li> The hairnets worked great and were good quality. I also like that the elastics are tight. All in all it&#x27;s a great buy. I still have a couple of them to keep shall I need one again.</li>
            <li> Of no use for the purchaser (Mrs. Dutt). Had to be discarded.</li>
            <li> These are made well, but the elastic is not strong enough to hold the hair inside of them</li>
            <li> I know that I won&#x27;t buy this in the future because the quality is very poor. The net and the elastic band are separated so many places which creats several holes all the way around. I have other nets and in comparison, this item is not worth to buy.</li>
            <li> Items look great, but the only problem was I ordered the wrong kind for my kids. I needed something that they wear to cover their hair for sleep.</li>
            <li> These were slow to arrive but they are of extremely high quality and durability. It was well worth the wait. I guess I should have uograded my shipping method if I needed them faster.</li>
