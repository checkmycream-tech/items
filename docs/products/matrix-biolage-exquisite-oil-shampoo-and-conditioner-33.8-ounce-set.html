            <li>and my stylist says our hair is healthy and beautiful!</li>
            <li>However, I was thrilled when I tried these products!</li>
            <li>My mother converted to Exquisite Oil after a weekend visit, and it&#x27;s done wonders for her baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>Good shampoo and conditioner.bought it for my daughter</li>
            <li>It does a good job for the price</li>
            <li>I should have known anything with the word &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; in it would not be a good choice for curly hair.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is as good as any hair mask you can purchase.  </li>
            <li>I follow it up with the Matrix Biolage Exquisite Oil Replenishing Treatment, which smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>I had samples of the shampoo/conditioner that I loved.</li>
            <li>CONDITIONER IS GOOD, BUT NOT SHAMPOO, IT TANGLED MY HAIR</li>
            <li>I was excited to see the exquisite oil line.</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>My hair is much better behaved!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li>and I love it!  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I ordered this shampoo and conditioner!  </li>
            <li>Love this shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li>Amazing product, makes my hair feel like I just went to the salon, I absolutely love it, and will buy it again!</li>
            <li>Got a sample from a friend and decided to buy the large ones, this is the best hair shampoo and conditioner I have ever used!!!</li>
            <li>It is amazing.</li>
            <li>It is that amazing.  </li>
            <li>And I honestly think the conditioner kinda smells like lemon Ajax.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worthwhile for those looking for a good combo.</li>
            <li>Being a professional hairstylist I have been using exquisite oil for a while now.</li>
            <li>I was using this shampoo and conditioner for 3 months, and at first I thought it was working great.</li>
            <li>After a week or two of using this shampoo and conditioner, my hair felt noticeably softer and people started to comment on how healthy my hair looked.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even been able to cut out most of the products I used after the shower, like the smoothing creme.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Buy it now if you want shiny, healthy hair that isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li>I normally love Biolage products.</li>
            <li>I love Matrix Biolage products and have used them for over 10 years.</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair silky smooth!</li>
            <li>Grrat product love</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>and we have not been able to find a product that could help.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t rave enough over the exquisite oil products.</li>
            <li>&amp; I still have these bottles in the shower, more than half-full.</li>
            <li>My favorite shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>The product was okay, no miracles.</li>
            <li>This shampoo keeps my hair shiny and looking healthy.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair feel silky and healthy.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I just love biolage shampoo.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not in love with it.</li>
            <li>and I love the smell.</li>
            <li>I have used Biolage for many years.  </li>
            <li>Even better is to put the conditioner on, add a plastic cap and then sit under a dryer for 30 minutes to an hour.  </li>
            <li>I have tried the  oil and we love that too.  </li>
            <li>There are much better products that condition with Argan oil.</li>
            <li>I LOVE these micro oil shampoo&#x27;s and conditioners.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff....</li>
            <li>Great price and fast shipping</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Super pleased with product as well as it was shipped in a timely manner!</li>
            <li>so I thought my dry hair would love the Exquisite Oil line</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and they do not leave my hair flat but give my damaged hair a great amount of shine and softness!</li>
            <li>(I got a perm and dye) and been trying many different products to solve the issue, I honestly admit that this one is, by far, the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>At first I really liked this combo.  </li>
            <li>so I have to use a ton even for my medium length fine hair.</li>
            <li>First, I love Biolage products and have been using them for many years.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to see great result and for the price I was expecting almost a miracle, but I just thing is pure geemicking and nothing else because this product doesn&#x27;t work not even on my straight hair.</li>
            <li>This duo has made a huge difference</li>
            <li>It has made a huge difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>Shampoo and conditioner makes hair feel fantastic, I would recommend adding a pump as dropping this size</li>
            <li>Make my hair much smooth.</li>
            <li>Great product, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>This is a great shampoo/conditioner for mixed hair.</li>
            <li>This stuff does leave your hair light - so if you&#x27;re worried about the &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; aspect - don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>This is not at all oily, it leaves my hair light and well moisturized.</li>
            <li>Makes me hair feel very silky smooth and smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t get a clean feeling after the shampoo.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and not unpleasant, but I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I both have long curly hair and this stuff is amazing!  </li>
            <li>I never felt like I got full coverage from scalp to ends.</li>
            <li>most &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; shampoos really aren&#x27;t, but this one is.</li>
            <li>Fruity, fresh and light; not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Smell great ( typical clean biolage smell.</li>
            <li>I did not have much luck with the shampoo that goes with it because it did not soften my hair and left it tangled, although it did smell great and cleaned the hair</li>
            <li>Normally Biolage products are very smoothing and have a phenomenal smell, (my husband used to compliment me after every wash!), but not the case with these...</li>
            <li>like and not be as shiny and healthy looking as normal.</li>
            <li>I do find that using it all the time seems to weigh my hair down a bit, so I&#x27;ve been treating it like a weekly treatment, leaving it in longer, and it&#x27;s worked great.</li>
            <li>This is our new favorite shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in the texture just after one use and by the end of the week it was back to looking healthy!</li>
            <li>Anyone else?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would make this purchase again, purely for the huge value compared to buying through a salon .</li>
            <li>I have very thick hair, this duo is the best thing I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>It rinses clean and my hair is extremely soft and absolutely full of body and shine!</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair in great shape without being heavy or oily.</li>
            <li>So far (a month of use), I love the softness of my hair, which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>, this is comparable but it never really feels as good as it does when it&#x27;s used at the salon.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t look for squeaky hair here because this shampoo does not do that, but don&#x27;t worry, your hair is clean and really very manageable.</li>
            <li>Shipping was way fast and price was right tho!</li>
            <li>I have used the &#x27;Hydrating&#x27; Biolage line in the past, and had been happy with it</li>
            <li>It weighs down the hair, and not in the good way.</li>
            <li>It smells good, left my hair shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li>Will re order, I have fine natural wavy shoulder length blond (with highlights) hair.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li>first of all, this is what i&#x27;m working with: i have sholder length, pin-straight hair, and i&#x27;m growing it.</li>
            <li>this on amazon was cheaper, buying the larger size gets you more for your $$.</li>
            <li>After the first wash I could already feel the difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price because it really doesn&#x27;t take much to coat every strand.</li>
            <li>But the scent is beautiful and I can comb through my long wet hair with no tangles when I use this!  </li>
            <li>the conditioner does not weigh my hair down, and i have amazing body when i style my hair after using this line.</li>
            <li>I tried the conditioner once; it turned my super frizzy, dry hair to smooth, silky one.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is very nice, similar to the other lines.</li>
            <li>Our hair is super soft.  </li>
            <li>I no longer put olive oil in my hair to calm it down and have gotten tons of compliments on how healthy my hair looks now.  </li>
            <li>This product is a gift straight from God.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t feel like this conditioner was any better then than the others, just harder to massage into my hair.</li>
            <li>, I expected better and faster results.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>my hair is a lot stronger and is much easier to handle.  </li>
            <li>she will continue to use it fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Like it a lot and go through it fast .</li>
            <li>It came fast</li>
            <li>and this product really improves the feel, look, and condition.  </li>
            <li>no matter how much I washed it or focused on rinsing it out.</li>
            <li>My hair is the kind of hair that gets dried out by a lot of salon products like redken and bed head.</li>
            <li>I LOVE Biolage and other Matrix products, but this one missed the mark.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll end up with much less, more damaged hair.  </li>
            <li>I will never use regular shampoo and conditioner such as dove  any more</li>
            <li>sure enough, it went back to being weighed down.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>i recently stopped coloring my hair to help get it back to healthy.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>and after a few uses my hair was back to being light and fluffy and felt great.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>but if I have to worry about if it will be the right one I ordered I will not be purchasing anything through them in the future.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this new Oil Shampoo after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li>I tried this new line</li>
            <li>continue to use this only because I bought such huge bottles</li>
            <li>Hi,it really works,before using this product my hair become very oily immediately the next day of shampoo, after started using this my problem solved.thanq matrix.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it can weigh it down and there is buildup.  </li>
            <li>This oil conditioner worked great on my over colored, dry brittle wavy thick hair!</li>
            <li>The Shampoo and Conditioner combined with the oil treatment turn my curly dry hair into lustrtous curls or with a flat iron silky smooth.</li>
            <li>This is gentle on hair and leaves it so soft like a deep conditioning treatment</li>
            <li>I use it for myself as well as my 4 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>This product is making my hair really soft.  </li>
            <li>Feels professional.  </li>
            <li>Made me self conscious about my hair for months.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is thick &amp; may be ok, but I just feel there&#x27;s only so much the conditioner can do after using that shampoo.</li>
            <li>I would have at least hoped for the nice smell since it&#x27;s been drying my hair out but no such luck!</li>
            <li>The shampoo is okay, the conditioner is the star, it&#x27;s so thick</li>
            <li>but the line did not seem to place a significant amount of moisturizer in my hair after I dried it.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is a little less concentrated than I have used before with a smaller size but still good.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this stuff if you color your hair, especially if you go lighter.</li>
            <li>I usually buy my Matrix through my hair salon so this was a huge bargain.</li>
            <li>Normally a fan of Matrix products, especially the Biolage line, but didn&#x27;t care for this at all.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is gentle and I feel like I could use it everyday without drying out my hair, and the conditioner feels like body butter and has really helped my hair regain some smoothness in texture.</li>
            <li>I generally like Matrix biolage products</li>
            <li>The only thing that surprised me is the thickness of the conditioner.</li>
            <li>Kind of expensive.</li>
            <li>I like to use heat on my hair - for better or worse, I do.</li>
            <li>but a lot of it, I blow dry and straighten is regularly and it started to feel very straw</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very thick and makes your hair super soft !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m constantly trying new products for my hair and this is the first one in at least the last 5 years I have purchased again and again.</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner last a long time for frequent shampooers.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is really thick and creamy, it almost feels like one of those super hydrating hair masks.</li>
            <li>My hair is thin and fine and thought just because it had oil</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> Amazing product, makes my hair feel like I just went to the salon, I absolutely love it, and will buy it again!</li>
            <li> Got a sample from a friend and decided to buy the large ones, this is the best hair shampoo and conditioner I have ever used!!!</li>
            <li> It is amazing.</li>
            <li> It is that amazing.  </li>
            <li> And I honestly think the conditioner kinda smells like lemon Ajax.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worthwhile for those looking for a good combo.</li>
            <li> Being a professional hairstylist I have been using exquisite oil for a while now.</li>
            <li> I was using this shampoo and conditioner for 3 months, and at first I thought it was working great.</li>
            <li> After a week or two of using this shampoo and conditioner, my hair felt noticeably softer and people started to comment on how healthy my hair looked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even been able to cut out most of the products I used after the shower, like the smoothing creme.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Buy it now if you want shiny, healthy hair that isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> I normally love Biolage products.</li>
            <li> I love Matrix Biolage products and have used them for over 10 years.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair silky smooth!</li>
            <li> Grrat product love</li>
            <li> LOVE IT</li>
            <li> and we have not been able to find a product that could help.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t rave enough over the exquisite oil products.</li>
            <li> &amp; I still have these bottles in the shower, more than half-full.</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> The product was okay, no miracles.</li>
            <li> This shampoo keeps my hair shiny and looking healthy.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair feel silky and healthy.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I just love biolage shampoo.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not in love with it.</li>
            <li> and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> I have used Biolage for many years.  </li>
            <li> Even better is to put the conditioner on, add a plastic cap and then sit under a dryer for 30 minutes to an hour.  </li>
            <li> I have tried the  oil and we love that too.  </li>
            <li> There are much better products that condition with Argan oil.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these micro oil shampoo&#x27;s and conditioners.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff....</li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Super pleased with product as well as it was shipped in a timely manner!</li>
            <li> so I thought my dry hair would love the Exquisite Oil line</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and they do not leave my hair flat but give my damaged hair a great amount of shine and softness!</li>
            <li> (I got a perm and dye) and been trying many different products to solve the issue, I honestly admit that this one is, by far, the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> At first I really liked this combo.  </li>
            <li> so I have to use a ton even for my medium length fine hair.</li>
            <li> First, I love Biolage products and have been using them for many years.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to see great result and for the price I was expecting almost a miracle, but I just thing is pure geemicking and nothing else because this product doesn&#x27;t work not even on my straight hair.</li>
            <li> This duo has made a huge difference</li>
            <li> It has made a huge difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> Shampoo and conditioner makes hair feel fantastic, I would recommend adding a pump as dropping this size</li>
            <li> Make my hair much smooth.</li>
            <li> Great product, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo/conditioner for mixed hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff does leave your hair light - so if you&#x27;re worried about the &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; aspect - don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This is not at all oily, it leaves my hair light and well moisturized.</li>
            <li> Makes me hair feel very silky smooth and smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t get a clean feeling after the shampoo.</li>
            <li> The scent is light and not unpleasant, but I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both have long curly hair and this stuff is amazing!  </li>
            <li> I never felt like I got full coverage from scalp to ends.</li>
            <li> most &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; shampoos really aren&#x27;t, but this one is.</li>
            <li> Fruity, fresh and light; not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> Smell great ( typical clean biolage smell.</li>
            <li> I did not have much luck with the shampoo that goes with it because it did not soften my hair and left it tangled, although it did smell great and cleaned the hair</li>
            <li> Normally Biolage products are very smoothing and have a phenomenal smell, (my husband used to compliment me after every wash!), but not the case with these...</li>
            <li> like and not be as shiny and healthy looking as normal.</li>
            <li> I do find that using it all the time seems to weigh my hair down a bit, so I&#x27;ve been treating it like a weekly treatment, leaving it in longer, and it&#x27;s worked great.</li>
            <li> This is our new favorite shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in the texture just after one use and by the end of the week it was back to looking healthy!</li>
            <li> Anyone else?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would make this purchase again, purely for the huge value compared to buying through a salon .</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair, this duo is the best thing I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> It rinses clean and my hair is extremely soft and absolutely full of body and shine!</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair in great shape without being heavy or oily.</li>
            <li> So far (a month of use), I love the softness of my hair, which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> , this is comparable but it never really feels as good as it does when it&#x27;s used at the salon.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t look for squeaky hair here because this shampoo does not do that, but don&#x27;t worry, your hair is clean and really very manageable.</li>
            <li> Shipping was way fast and price was right tho!</li>
            <li> I have used the &#x27;Hydrating&#x27; Biolage line in the past, and had been happy with it</li>
            <li> It weighs down the hair, and not in the good way.</li>
            <li> It smells good, left my hair shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li> Will re order, I have fine natural wavy shoulder length blond (with highlights) hair.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> first of all, this is what i&#x27;m working with: i have sholder length, pin-straight hair, and i&#x27;m growing it.</li>
            <li> this on amazon was cheaper, buying the larger size gets you more for your $$.</li>
            <li> After the first wash I could already feel the difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price because it really doesn&#x27;t take much to coat every strand.</li>
            <li> But the scent is beautiful and I can comb through my long wet hair with no tangles when I use this!  </li>
            <li> the conditioner does not weigh my hair down, and i have amazing body when i style my hair after using this line.</li>
            <li> I tried the conditioner once; it turned my super frizzy, dry hair to smooth, silky one.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is very nice, similar to the other lines.</li>
            <li> Our hair is super soft.  </li>
            <li> I no longer put olive oil in my hair to calm it down and have gotten tons of compliments on how healthy my hair looks now.  </li>
            <li> This product is a gift straight from God.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel like this conditioner was any better then than the others, just harder to massage into my hair.</li>
            <li> , I expected better and faster results.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> my hair is a lot stronger and is much easier to handle.  </li>
            <li> she will continue to use it fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Like it a lot and go through it fast .</li>
            <li> It came fast</li>
            <li> and this product really improves the feel, look, and condition.  </li>
            <li> no matter how much I washed it or focused on rinsing it out.</li>
            <li> My hair is the kind of hair that gets dried out by a lot of salon products like redken and bed head.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Biolage and other Matrix products, but this one missed the mark.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll end up with much less, more damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> I will never use regular shampoo and conditioner such as dove  any more</li>
            <li> sure enough, it went back to being weighed down.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> i recently stopped coloring my hair to help get it back to healthy.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> and after a few uses my hair was back to being light and fluffy and felt great.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> but if I have to worry about if it will be the right one I ordered I will not be purchasing anything through them in the future.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this new Oil Shampoo after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li> I tried this new line</li>
            <li> continue to use this only because I bought such huge bottles</li>
            <li> Hi,it really works,before using this product my hair become very oily immediately the next day of shampoo, after started using this my problem solved.thanq matrix.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and it can weigh it down and there is buildup.  </li>
            <li> This oil conditioner worked great on my over colored, dry brittle wavy thick hair!</li>
            <li> The Shampoo and Conditioner combined with the oil treatment turn my curly dry hair into lustrtous curls or with a flat iron silky smooth.</li>
            <li> This is gentle on hair and leaves it so soft like a deep conditioning treatment</li>
            <li> I use it for myself as well as my 4 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> This product is making my hair really soft.  </li>
            <li> Feels professional.  </li>
            <li> Made me self conscious about my hair for months.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is thick &amp; may be ok, but I just feel there&#x27;s only so much the conditioner can do after using that shampoo.</li>
            <li> I would have at least hoped for the nice smell since it&#x27;s been drying my hair out but no such luck!</li>
            <li> The shampoo is okay, the conditioner is the star, it&#x27;s so thick</li>
            <li> but the line did not seem to place a significant amount of moisturizer in my hair after I dried it.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is a little less concentrated than I have used before with a smaller size but still good.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this stuff if you color your hair, especially if you go lighter.</li>
            <li> I usually buy my Matrix through my hair salon so this was a huge bargain.</li>
            <li> Normally a fan of Matrix products, especially the Biolage line, but didn&#x27;t care for this at all.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is gentle and I feel like I could use it everyday without drying out my hair, and the conditioner feels like body butter and has really helped my hair regain some smoothness in texture.</li>
            <li> I generally like Matrix biolage products</li>
            <li> The only thing that surprised me is the thickness of the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Kind of expensive.</li>
            <li> I like to use heat on my hair - for better or worse, I do.</li>
            <li> but a lot of it, I blow dry and straighten is regularly and it started to feel very straw</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and makes your hair super soft !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m constantly trying new products for my hair and this is the first one in at least the last 5 years I have purchased again and again.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner last a long time for frequent shampooers.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is really thick and creamy, it almost feels like one of those super hydrating hair masks.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and fine and thought just because it had oil</li>
            <li> I have very curly, thick, long, dry hair and have put oil in my hair for a long time to moisturize it and calm the frizz down.  </li>
            <li> It will last for a LONG time.</li>
            <li> It has made my hair soft and manageable, without it looking greasy or weighed down.  </li>
            <li> well it did not moisturize my dry curly hair enough.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this shampoo and conditioner made my hair super greasy after only like two days after washing it, and sometimes even just the next day..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s extremely hard to brush through my straight, shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li> Fighting the tangles that this shampoo and conditioner leave has added at least 10 minutes to the process of getting ready in the morning</li>
            <li> The conditioner smells strange, nothing like the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Given that I&#x27;ve been battling with severe hair damage problems for so long</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday, but my hair still feels soft on the days i don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am growing my hair out, currently down to my butt and have to be really careful about what shampoo/cond I use since my hair is naturally curly and loves to get tangled.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, oily at the roots, dry at the ends.  </li>
            <li> After I&#x27;m done with that and then battling the tangles while I blow dry my hair I have to pick up a pile of hair off the floor.  </li>
            <li> from years of processing, my hair has gotten dry.</li>
            <li> Curly hair tends to be dry and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I have dry hair and curl, but with this product my hair feels softer and manageable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never loved a product this much.</li>
            <li> and I normally never get greasy hair like this.</li>
            <li> and you won&#x27;t run out of shampoo/conditioner for a long time!!  </li>
            <li> it is not pleasant smelling and the conditioner is much thicker and heavier than salon bought biolage product.</li>
            <li> My son has very dry hair</li>
            <li> I got this product for my mix girl, she had very dry, damaged hair and after reading the reviews I thought that this was the solution for my daughter.</li>
            <li> but this product left a heavy feeling after a week or 2 of washes.</li>
            <li> Then, a few weeks later, my hair began to feel heavy, extra oily, and like there was a ton of build up in it.</li>
            <li> When I would straighten my hair it would be flat and heavy against my head.</li>
            <li> My hair also seems to be healthier and less dry from the summer swimming pool.</li>
            <li> My conditioner is VERY thick, I wonder if this was normal?</li>
            <li> I usually avoid &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; products because it instantly translated to dirty-looking hair.</li>
            <li> I do like some of the other Biolage products</li>
            <li> She has an even harder time than I trying to find a product that repairs and adds shine to her hair without making it greasy and limp.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is low sudsing, and the cream conditioner is thick.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> Shampoo leaves hair shiny without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> I am trying to wash it less and get it healthier.  </li>
            <li> I also believe it has helped me lose less hair.</li>
            <li> Not ideal for frequent use.</li>
            <li> The conditioner really weighs my hair down and it is nearly impossible to get the conditioner out of the bottle due to its thickness.</li>
            <li> I have medium thick, shoulder length hair with dry, frizzy ends and greasy, limp roots.</li>
            <li> Thorough without heavily coating hair.  </li>
            <li> This dried out my hair, which is shoulder length.</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to not only find this shampoo in stores but especially finding it this size.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure, but if you are buying these based off the little travel sized samples, I would not get this.</li>
            <li> I have thin long hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick sometimes dry hair</li>
            <li> Now I just use a small root lifter and health protecting spray.</li>
            <li> No more tears from tangles</li>
            <li> I usually use redkin</li>
            <li> but lately it seems they are changing their product line</li>
            <li> I have made a lot of changes with my hair lately.  </li>
            <li> I do use a clarifying shampoo at least once, if not twice a week to manage the buildup.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly thick and curly hair</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thick, but finer in texture.</li>
            <li> I mean, almost like a paste.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very very thick and hard to massage and spread.</li>
            <li> My hair was very dry from the cold winter weather and repeated coloring.</li>
            <li> Not a good combo.</li>
            <li> bottle on your toe will result in a broken toe,</li>
            <li> To make things worse, my hairfall has increased since I started using this duo.</li>
            <li> also the product does increase issues with weighing down and leaving water soaked into the hair as well as increasing grooming time due to horrible tangles.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> Really, really disappointed &amp; wasted my money here.</li>
            <li> Received the wrong shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it was difficult to place 2 bottles in a box.</li>
            <li> It is close to the consistency of toothpaste and difficult to squeeze out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d hate to waste it.  </li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t style it everyday, but when i do i tease &amp; hairspray the crap out of it</li>
            <li> disappointing.</li>
            <li> but this one is nothing but a disappointment.</li>
            <li> It still felt dirty after I washed it.  </li>
            <li> It can be difficult to find this product in the liter bottles, so when I can find them I stock up!</li>
            <li> Even with the pump, it is VERY difficult to get the conditioner to come out.</li>
            <li> it would be a bad idea for me.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Greta product, keeps your color in for awhile</li>
            <li> This is our new favorite shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Wish I could give this 100 stars! I&#x27;ve never loved a product this much. Totally repaired my processed blond hair, without leaving a grease deposit at my roots. I have medium thick, shoulder length hair with dry, frizzy ends and greasy, limp roots. Not a good combo. After a week or two of using this shampoo and conditioner, my hair felt noticeably softer and people started to comment on how healthy my hair looked. No one has ever said that! And again, I can&#x27;t stress enough the fact that my roots are lustrous-- not greasy! I usually avoid &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; products because it instantly translated to dirty-looking hair. Not this. My mother converted to Exquisite Oil after a weekend visit, and it&#x27;s done wonders for her baby fine hair. She has an even harder time than I trying to find a product that repairs and adds shine to her hair without making it greasy and limp. It&#x27;s worth the price because it really doesn&#x27;t take much to coat every strand. I&#x27;ve even been able to cut out most of the products I used after the shower, like the smoothing creme. Now I just use a small root lifter and health protecting spray. Before using Exquisite Oil, I could&#x27;ve never dreamed of blow drying my hair without gobs of smoothing creme. I&#x27;m a lifetime customer and I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR This product is a gift straight from God. Buy it now if you want shiny, healthy hair that isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is low sudsing, and the cream conditioner is thick.  But the scent is beautiful and I can comb through my long wet hair with no tangles when I use this!  That makes me very happy!</li>
            <li> great product.  Would buy it again and again.</li>
            <li> Shampoo and conditioner makes hair feel fantastic, I would recommend adding a pump as dropping this size bottle on your toe will result in a broken toe,</li>
            <li> I normally love Biolage products. I use them exclusively. I was excited to see the exquisite oil line. The shampoo is very nice, similar to the other lines. The conditioner I wasn&#x27;t  a fan of. It&#x27;s very very thick and hard to massage and spread. I never felt like I got full coverage from scalp to ends. I have incredibly thick and curly hair and I don&#x27;t feel like this conditioner was any better then than the others, just harder to massage into my hair.</li>
            <li> The shampoo seems great. The conditioner really weighs my hair down and it is nearly impossible to get the conditioner out of the bottle due to its thickness. I even contacted Amazon and they said there was a pump that would work. Even with the pump, it is VERY difficult to get the conditioner to come out. I will not be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> Love this! Makes me hair feel very silky smooth and smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this shampoo and conditioner made my hair super greasy after only like two days after washing it, and sometimes even just the next day.. and I normally never get greasy hair like this. And I honestly think the conditioner kinda smells like lemon Ajax.&lt;br /&gt;So two stars for this product</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo based on the customer reviews.  I do like some of the other Biolage products but lately it seems they are changing their product line and I can no longer find my favorites so I figured I&#x27;d give this a try.  After 3 days of using it I&#x27;m going out to buy something else or I&#x27;ll end up bald.  I do like the way it makes my hair feel once it&#x27;s done and styled but after I get out of the shower it&#x27;s extremely hard to brush through my straight, shoulder length hair.  After I&#x27;m done with that and then battling the tangles while I blow dry my hair I have to pick up a pile of hair off the floor.  Fighting the tangles that this shampoo and conditioner leave has added at least 10 minutes to the process of getting ready in the morning and if I continue using it I&#x27;ll end up with much less, more damaged hair.  I had high hopes but I wish I could return it and get my money back.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this product. I love Matrix Biolage products and have used them for over 10 years. This exquisite oil version does not smell well nor does it do what it says it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> Product came open and damaged</li>
            <li> disappointing. it is not pleasant smelling and the conditioner is much thicker and heavier than salon bought biolage product. also the product does increase issues with weighing down and leaving water soaked into the hair as well as increasing grooming time due to horrible tangles.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair silky smooth! I use it for myself as well as my 4 year old daughter. No more tears from tangles and my stylist says our hair is healthy and beautiful!</li>
            <li> Will re order, I have fine natural wavy shoulder length blond (with highlights) hair. The shampoo is okay, the conditioner is the star, it&#x27;s so thick I only need a tiny bit, and so it lasts forever. Smell great ( typical clean biolage smell.</li>
            <li> The conditioner smells like rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> Got a sample from a friend and decided to buy the large ones, this is the best hair shampoo and conditioner I have ever used!!!</li>
            <li> Grrat product love it nakes hair silkt soorh and mosturizes my hair&lt;br /&gt;. Arrived in great condition no damage to box</li>
            <li> After one month of using this shampoo and it&#x27;s conditioner, I expected better and faster results.&lt;br /&gt;But considering the damage my hair had, I am happy I bought this product. It did help!</li>
            <li> I have very curly, thick, long, dry hair and have put oil in my hair for a long time to moisturize it and calm the frizz down.  With this shampoo and conditioner my hair is a lot stronger and is much easier to handle.  I no longer put olive oil in my hair to calm it down and have gotten tons of compliments on how healthy my hair looks now.  This is a great product!</li>
            <li> Being a professional hairstylist I have been using exquisite oil for a while now. It moisturizes well and smells great. It was shipped promptly and I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and fine and thought just because it had oil it would be a bad idea for me. I got it as a gift and gave it a try after I ran out of my regular shampoo, big big surprise! I have been using it ever since! LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Super pleased with product as well as it was shipped in a timely manner!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and excellent value.</li>
            <li> As advertized, great product!</li>
            <li> It is amazing. Make my hair much smooth. I will never use regular shampoo and conditioner such as dove  any more</li>
            <li> My son has very dry hair and we have not been able to find a product that could help. This duo has made a huge difference</li>
            <li> The Shampoo and Conditioner combined with the oil treatment turn my curly dry hair into lustrtous curls or with a flat iron silky smooth. I can&#x27;t rave enough over the exquisite oil products.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner has cleansed my hair and yet allowed it to be weightless and curly not frizzy, no tangles. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I like their Color Care shampoo &amp; conditioner so I thought my dry hair would love the Exquisite Oil line but this product left a heavy feeling after a week or 2 of washes. It&#x27;s been months &amp; I still have these bottles in the shower, more than half-full.</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo and conditioner. This is the best conditioner I have ever used! It&#x27;s very thick and makes your hair super soft !</li>
            <li> Hi,it really works,before using this product my hair become very oily immediately the next day of shampoo, after started using this my problem solved.thanq matrix.</li>
            <li> Good shampoo and conditioner.bought it for my daughter and she lover it.said she will continue to use it fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair, this duo is the best thing I have ever used.  It has made my hair soft and manageable, without it looking greasy or weighed down.  This, and Biosilk Silk Therapy are absolutes for me.</li>
            <li> Shampoo does not lather well so I have to use a ton even for my medium length fine hair. I also don&#x27;t get a clean feeling after the shampoo. The conditioner smells strange, nothing like the shampoo. To make things worse, my hairfall has increased since I started using this duo. I generally like Matrix biolage products but this one is nothing but a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for months . Bought in bulk this time. Like it a lot and go through it fast .</li>
            <li> The product was okay, no miracles. Kind of expensive.</li>
            <li> I have thin long hair. My hair is the kind of hair that gets dried out by a lot of salon products like redken and bed head. This is gentle on hair and leaves it so soft like a deep conditioning treatment but it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. I&#x27;m constantly trying new products for my hair and this is the first one in at least the last 5 years I have purchased again and again.</li>
            <li> Dries out my ends! Makes my hair tangled and brittle!</li>
            <li> Great product, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair in great shape without being heavy or oily. Will continue to use this product. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Received the wrong shampoo and conditioner. I didn&#x27;t think it was difficult to place 2 bottles in a box. It came fast but if I have to worry about if it will be the right one I ordered I will not be purchasing anything through them in the future.</li>
            <li> I have made a lot of changes with my hair lately.  I am trying to wash it less and get it healthier.  This product is making my hair really soft.  It was not overnight but a few weeks that I really started to notice a difference</li>
            <li> Love this product!! I have frizzy hair so it helps to keep the frizz at a minimum!!  The smell is awesome also.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, makes my hair feel like I just went to the salon, I absolutely love it, and will buy it again!</li>
            <li> First, I love Biolage products and have been using them for many years. I decided to try this new Oil Shampoo after reading the reviews. So far (a month of use), I love the softness of my hair, which is what I was looking for. My hair also seems to be healthier and less dry from the summer swimming pool. The only thing that surprised me is the thickness of the conditioner. It is close to the consistency of toothpaste and difficult to squeeze out of the bottle.  However, that does not discourage me or diminish the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> A great product. The shampoo is a little less concentrated than I have used before with a smaller size but still good.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and it can weigh it down and there is buildup.  I like it but because I have problems getting a &#x27;fullness&#x27; to my hair as it is - I will be getting something else.  Shipping was way fast and price was right tho!</li>
            <li> perfect, great product, great price - thank you amazon</li>
            <li> Normally a fan of Matrix products, especially the Biolage line, but didn&#x27;t care for this at all. My hair feels like straw after shampooing &amp; I can get that from a store bought shampoo for a buck. The conditioner is thick &amp; may be ok, but I just feel there&#x27;s only so much the conditioner can do after using that shampoo. Really, really disappointed &amp; wasted my money here. Normally Biolage products are very smoothing and have a phenomenal smell, (my husband used to compliment me after every wash!), but not the case with these...I would have at least hoped for the nice smell since it&#x27;s been drying my hair out but no such luck!</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to not only find this shampoo in stores but especially finding it this size. This shampoo keeps my hair shiny and looking healthy. I also believe it has helped me lose less hair.</li>
            <li> You literally CANNOT beat this value for this product! Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Very nice. Makes your hair feel silky and healthy. Don&#x27;t look for squeaky hair here because this shampoo does not do that, but don&#x27;t worry, your hair is clean and really very manageable.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo/conditioner for mixed hair. It&#x27;s worthwhile for those looking for a good combo.</li>
            <li> Great value ,will buy again</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever thought of using this shampoo and were worried about it making your hair oily, don&#x27;t!  This shampoo and conditioner is the best I&#x27;ve ever used! It rinses clean and my hair is extremely soft and absolutely full of body and shine!</li>
            <li> I have used the &#x27;Hydrating&#x27; Biolage line in the past, and had been happy with it but the line did not seem to place a significant amount of moisturizer in my hair after I dried it. However, I was thrilled when I tried these products! I have fine hair and they do not leave my hair flat but give my damaged hair a great amount of shine and softness! I would definitely recommend these products - I plan on purchasing again!</li>
            <li> I like this product.  It does a good job for the price and you won&#x27;t run out of shampoo/conditioner for a long time!!  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> My hair was very dry from the cold winter weather and repeated coloring. This shampoo and conditioner was the solution. My hair is much better behaved!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  If you have hair that frizzes this is for you.  Salons only carry it occasionally.  Great price and prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, oily at the roots, dry at the ends.  I shampoo my roots, and condition my ends on a daily basis.  At first I really liked this combo.  It smells good, left my hair shiny and soft.  Then, a few weeks later, my hair began to feel heavy, extra oily, and like there was a ton of build up in it. It still felt dirty after I washed it.  I bought a clarifying shampoo (neutrogena) and after a few uses my hair was back to being light and fluffy and felt great.  I went back to using this... sure enough, it went back to being weighed down.&lt;br /&gt;I continue to use this only because I bought such huge bottles and I&#x27;d hate to waste it.  I do use a clarifying shampoo at least once, if not twice a week to manage the buildup.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Biolage and other Matrix products, but this one missed the mark. I should have known anything with the word &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; in it would not be a good choice for curly hair. It weighs down the hair, and not in the good way. Go sparingly, or use every once in a while. Not ideal for frequent use.</li>
            <li> I just love biolage shampoo. These two products always work so well for me. My hair has seen a great difference and is way healthier with using this product then any tresemme product or anything else.</li>
            <li> No different than buying from the salon. Price is great! Been using this shampoo and conditioner on my hair for a while and I love it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this duo set expecting to get one each for shampoo and conditioner. However, they ended up sending me two bottles of shampoo. I was a little disappointed. Nevertheless, the product quality itself is very good. I tried the conditioner once; it turned my super frizzy, dry hair to smooth, silky one. Given that I&#x27;ve been battling with severe hair damage problems for so long (I got a perm and dye) and been trying many different products to solve the issue, I honestly admit that this one is, by far, the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I will definitely buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> This stuff does leave your hair light - so if you&#x27;re worried about the &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; aspect - don&#x27;t. I usually use redkin and I&#x27;ve been happy with that, this is comparable but it never really feels as good as it does when it&#x27;s used at the salon. I like it but I&#x27;m not in love with it. I&#x27;m going to try &amp;#34;it&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; next.</li>
            <li> I got this product for my mix girl, she had very dry, damaged hair and after reading the reviews I thought that this was the solution for my daughter. After 1st apply i did not see any difference of any regular shampoo but we&#x27;ve been using this now for 3 weeks and still nothing., not even detangling after shower. I was hoping to see great result and for the price I was expecting almost a miracle, but I just thing is pure geemicking and nothing else because this product doesn&#x27;t work not even on my straight hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo and conditioner! My hair feels great and I love the smell. Great price as well!</li>
            <li> first of all, this is what i&#x27;m working with: i have sholder length, pin-straight hair, and i&#x27;m growing it. it&#x27;s thick, but finer in texture. from years of processing, my hair has gotten dry. i recently stopped coloring my hair to help get it back to healthy. i only get it cut 2-3 times a year since i&#x27;m growing it out. i don&#x27;t style it everyday, but when i do i tease &amp; hairspray the crap out of it (the bigger the hair the closer to heaven!). i wash it 2-3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now, onto my review. i got a sample of this stuff and immediately had to have it. it&#x27;s amazing! incredibly moisturizing, even the shampoo! most &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; shampoos really aren&#x27;t, but this one is. the conditioner does not weigh my hair down, and i have amazing body when i style my hair after using this line. i don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday, but my hair still feels soft on the days i don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;buying this on amazon was cheaper, buying the larger size gets you more for your $$. highly recommend this stuff if you color your hair, especially if you go lighter.</li>
            <li> Great value compared to salon bought or store bought.  This shampoo and conditioner last a long time for frequent shampooers. It is my signature shampoo and conditioner. &#x27;</li>
            <li> Smells awesome. Fruity, fresh and light; not overpowering.  Feels professional.  Shampoo leaves hair shiny without weighing it down.  This is one of the best conditioners I&#x27;ve ever used.  Thorough without heavily coating hair.  I have very thick sometimes dry hair and this product really improves the feel, look, and condition.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have used Biolage for many years.  I tried this new line and I love it!  My daughter and I both have long curly hair and this stuff is amazing!  The conditioner is as good as any hair mask you can purchase.  Curly hair tends to be dry and frizzy.  This stuff truly gets rid of the frizz.  We often put the conditioner on and leave it on for an hour before rinsing.  Our hair is super soft.  Even better is to put the conditioner on, add a plastic cap and then sit under a dryer for 30 minutes to an hour.  It&#x27;s like a deep conditioning treatment from the salon.  People even ask, &amp;#34;What did you do to your hair?&amp;#34;  It is that amazing.  I have tried the  oil and we love that too.  It can be difficult to find this product in the liter bottles, so when I can find them I stock up!</li>
            <li> This dried out my hair, which is shoulder length. Very disappointing. There are much better products that condition with Argan oil. The scent is light and not unpleasant, but I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these micro oil shampoo&#x27;s and conditioners. I am growing my hair out, currently down to my butt and have to be really careful about what shampoo/cond I use since my hair is naturally curly and loves to get tangled. This is not at all oily, it leaves my hair light and well moisturized. I can go two days in-between shampoo&#x27;s. The conditioner is really thick and creamy, it almost feels like one of those super hydrating hair masks. Matrix recently &amp;#34;updated&amp;#34; their bottle designs, taking away 3 oz and charging the same price so I jumped when I saw these 33 oz bottles on amazon! Will probably stock up at my next pay check.</li>
            <li> This was a GREAT buy for me! I usually buy my Matrix through my hair salon so this was a huge bargain. It will last for a LONG time. It doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering fragrance. My conditioner is VERY thick, I wonder if this was normal? I mean, almost like a paste. I did want something that would hydrate my hair so maybe the ultra-thick consistency is how this is supposed to be. Anyone else?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would make this purchase again, purely for the huge value compared to buying through a salon .</li>
            <li> This is great shampoo and conditioner.  I have 2 bi-racial girls with lots of hair so this helps to moisturize it so i can get that comb through it.  I follow it up with the Matrix Biolage Exquisite Oil Replenishing Treatment, which smells fantastic. It makes a big difference.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t strip your hair and it keeps it moisturized even if you shampoo daily. I sometimes just use the conditioner and it&#x27;s never greasy. Love this stuff....</li>
            <li> I had samples of the shampoo/conditioner that I loved. However, I feel like the formula for the 33 oz is different- can the size be a factor? I&#x27;m not sure, but if you are buying these based off the little travel sized samples, I would not get this.</li>
            <li> I like to use heat on my hair - for better or worse, I do. The shampoo is gentle and I feel like I could use it everyday without drying out my hair, and the conditioner feels like body butter and has really helped my hair regain some smoothness in texture. I do find that using it all the time seems to weigh my hair down a bit, so I&#x27;ve been treating it like a weekly treatment, leaving it in longer, and it&#x27;s worked great.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I ordered this shampoo and conditioner!  I just changed my color and my hair was feeling like straw.  After the first wash I could already feel the difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast shipping</li>
            <li> This oil conditioner worked great on my over colored, dry brittle wavy thick hair! It left my hair with softness and shine. I did not have much luck with the shampoo that goes with it because it did not soften my hair and left it tangled, although it did smell great and cleaned the hair well it did not moisturize my dry curly hair enough.</li>
            <li> CONDITIONER IS GOOD, BUT NOT SHAMPOO, IT TANGLED MY HAIR, MY HAIR FELT LIKE WIRE.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner! It has made a huge difference in my hair. I have thin/fine hair but a lot of it, I blow dry and straighten is regularly and it started to feel very straw like and not be as shiny and healthy looking as normal. I noticed a difference in the texture just after one use and by the end of the week it was back to looking healthy!</li>
            <li> I was using this shampoo and conditioner for 3 months, and at first I thought it was working great. My hair started getting greasy and knotty no matter how much I washed it or focused on rinsing it out. I thought it was just me so I kept using it. When I would straighten my hair it would be flat and heavy against my head. I switched back to tea tree shampoo to detox my hair and it has never felt lighter or cleaner. I will NEVER use this again. Made me self conscious about my hair for months.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have dry hair and curl, but with this product my hair feels softer and manageable.</li>
