            <li>This oil really is great for the skin.</li>
            <li>This is a really good value and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li>but this is a good buy.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t explain how much I love this product!</li>
            <li>My boyfriend would always comment on how amazing my skin looks.</li>
            <li>I think this is a fantastic product and an exceptional deal.</li>
            <li>The odor is very light.  </li>
            <li>I love this oil</li>
            <li>and my skin could not be any better.</li>
            <li>, this stuff was available at a great price, but I&#x27;d rather pay a few bucks more and get something that doesn&#x27;t stink.</li>
            <li>Overall a good product.</li>
            <li>This one smells really really rancid just like many of the reviewers say.  </li>
            <li>I have mild cystic acne around my chin, and I&#x27;ve used so many products to help my acne clear.</li>
            <li>This oil has very lite fragrance and it keeps my face smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a distinctly olivy smell and feel.</li>
            <li>It soaks right into your skin.  </li>
            <li>delivery was spot on, but the oil doesnt feel right.</li>
            <li>I would rather spend a few dollars more to get a better quality product.</li>
            <li>The smell is natural, packaging fine.  </li>
            <li>For some reason this brand didn&#x27;t work as well as the first one I tried.</li>
            <li>It also makes my curly hair so soft ,makes my hair look like wavy, so comfortable.</li>
            <li>I thought I was being very clever, saving money buying this instead of the Josie Maran Argan Oil</li>
            <li>and I just can not get past the way it smells..the oil is good but really smells</li>
            <li>i really like it and use on skin and hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 60 and have not been one to really take care of my skin.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li>It has a slight smell to it but easy to get use to after awhile.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you if this is precisely the same or not, but I can say that it feels the same.  </li>
            <li>If you can get past the smell then for sure use it on the face skin hair</li>
            <li>I bought my first on in December of l 2013 and just bought my second one  (April &#x27;14).</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to smells, do not waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I waited a whole month to reorder (BIG MISTAKE)</li>
            <li>ive used many organic products, and i even make my own line of certain items, but this was runny, smelled terrible and i immediateky washed it out and started again.</li>
            <li>The envelope in which the clear, plastic bottle was shipped arrived soaked through with oil, and the USPS has wrapped the entire thing in a plastic bag &amp;#34;apologizing&amp;#34; for the damage to the package.</li>
            <li>The real deal and it is all as stated and expected.</li>

            <li> The real deal and it is all as stated and expected.</li>
            <li> Additionally, argan oil is supposed to be stored in dark, glass bottles to preserve its quality, not in clear, plastic ones like this one.</li>
            <li> I failed to read the reviews only because my main focus was finding a large bottle of argan oil</li>
            <li> I live in CO and never had trouble with dry skin</li>
            <li> I use this in the winter for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> i might throw in the extra few dollars and get something nicer next time.</li>
            <li> it is not as bad as some other reviews made it out to seem, but it is not as nutty as i expected and it has a melting plastic kind scent.</li>
            <li> Heed my warning, I have purchased other smaller bottles of argan oil by other manufacturers and none of them smelled even close to what this one smells like.</li>
            <li> It has a really strong smell and inexplicably makes my skin drier than before application.</li>
            <li> the smell wont go away and adding it to other products ruins the smell of them, so the only way to beat the smell of it is to add three tablespoons of tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> Sort of floral but not really.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different brands of argan oil.</li>
            <li> Although this seemed to provide the same level of moisturizing as the other, the smell* was just something I cannot get past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Argan oil but nothing has compared.</li>
            <li> I used it a few times and then gave up.</li>
            <li> A small amount covers well with no oily feeling.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t get past that.</li>
            <li> it does not absorb into my skin the way other argan oils do and the smell is not great.</li>
            <li> I even tried using it for a couple of days because I hate going through the trouble of returning and shipping, but finally couldn&#x27;t take it anymore.</li>
            <li> I really had to return this product because it smelled horrible.</li>
            <li> The moment I opened it there was this weird chemical smell.</li>
            <li> It smells like poo seriously like dirty baby diaper!</li>
            <li> Maybe I just got a bad batch.</li>
            <li> This smells bad</li>
            <li> Maybe the bottle I got has gone bad or maybe it just is what it is but</li>
            <li> It was that bad!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> my skin was awful.</li>
            <li> it is the worst smelling oil I have ever used, imagine walking through a farm with nothing but goat poo around you and</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this oil but it is too stinky to put on especially in my hair, it smells to me like a baby&#x27;s poopy diaper and everyone I had smell it thinks the same thing. If you can get past the smell then for sure use it on the face skin hair it is awesome.</li>
            <li> This is the second brand of argan oil I have tried. For some reason this brand didn&#x27;t work as well as the first one I tried. It has a really strong smell and inexplicably makes my skin drier than before application. I think it might be cut with olive oil. It&#x27;s got a distinctly olivy smell and feel.</li>
            <li> I use Josie and have been hooked on it for some time now.  I can&#x27;t tell you if this is precisely the same or not, but I can say that it feels the same.  It soaks right into your skin.  The odor is very light.  I think this is a fantastic product and an exceptional deal.</li>
            <li> I thought I was being very clever, saving money buying this instead of the Josie Maran Argan Oil I tried at Sephora. But cliches are cliches for a reason -- you get what you pay for. Although this seemed to provide the same level of moisturizing as the other, the smell* was just something I cannot get past. I used it a few times and then gave up. If you are sensitive to smells, do not waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Hard to describe. Sort of floral but not really. Just...off.</li>
            <li> delivery was spot on, but the oil doesnt feel right. it does not absorb into my skin the way other argan oils do and the smell is not great. it is not as bad as some other reviews made it out to seem, but it is not as nutty as i expected and it has a melting plastic kind scent. i might throw in the extra few dollars and get something nicer next time.</li>
            <li> This oil has very lite fragrance and it keeps my face smooth. I stopped using my daily moisturizer after using this. I am using it every day.It also makes my curly hair so soft ,makes my hair look like wavy, so comfortable. Will buy again. I hope this bottle comes couple of months</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t explain how much I love this product! I have mild cystic acne around my chin, and I&#x27;ve used so many products to help my acne clear. I bought my first on in December of l 2013 and just bought my second one  (April &#x27;14). This product has cleared my acne alone, It does take time but within a week my acne started to Improve. I would use the oil cleansing method 2x per day and Neutrogena cleansing bar after to help get rid of the extra oils and moisturize with ABH AGRAN oil . My boyfriend would always comment on how amazing my skin looks. 2 months ago I ran out and my Cystic acne came back and I waited a whole month to reorder (BIG MISTAKE) my skin was awful. It&#x27;s now May 1st and my skin could not be any better. This product is liquid gold. It has a slight smell to it but easy to get use to after awhile. I&#x27;ve used other Argan oil but nothing has compared. I have friends and family buying this stuff also have my followers on youtube can&#x27;t get enough.</li>
            <li> a shame i cant give it zero stars. it smells of rotting apples, literally, and made my hair separate while blow drying and feel and look like straw. ive used many organic products, and i even make my own line of certain items, but this was runny, smelled terrible and i immediateky washed it out and started again.</li>
            <li> This product is great for hair treatment and as a moisturizer on face. A small amount covers well with no oily feeling.</li>
            <li> Well it smooths the frizz out of my hair but............... it is the worst smelling oil I have ever used, imagine walking through a farm with nothing but goat poo around you and the smell wont go away and adding it to other products ruins the smell of them, so the only way to beat the smell of it is to add three tablespoons of tea tree oil. Hope this helps with future buyers.</li>
            <li> After reading the wonderful reviews, I took a chance and ordered this product. I couldn&#x27;t get pass the foul smell of this product to use it.  I am returning it.</li>
            <li> I use this in the winter for dry skin.  I add it to my facial cleaner, and use it as my night time moisturizer.  This is a really good value and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> The real deal and it is all as stated and expected. The smell is natural, packaging fine.  Overall a good product.</li>
            <li> This product smells like poop and I can&#x27;t get past that. I have used 100% Moroccan Argan oil before and never had this problem. I would rather spend a few dollars more to get a better quality product. Because the last thing I want to so is walk around smelling s*** all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different brands of argan oil. I know what it&#x27;s supposed to smell like -- somewhere between a fruity smell and a nutty smell. I couldn&#x27;t quite describe the scent of this brand, until my wife sniffed it and exclaimed, &amp;#34;It smells like the disinfectant they use in porta-potties!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, this stuff was available at a great price, but I&#x27;d rather pay a few bucks more and get something that doesn&#x27;t stink. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This oil really is great for the skin.</li>
            <li> The bottle was smaller then I thought but this is a good buy. i really like it and use on skin and hair. Would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I really had to return this product because it smelled horrible. The moment I opened it there was this weird chemical smell. Maybe I just got a bad batch. I even tried using it for a couple of days because I hate going through the trouble of returning and shipping, but finally couldn&#x27;t take it anymore. It was that bad!</li>
            <li> As soon as it was opened it smelled rotten. Just threw it away....DO not buy this product. Organic my *ss.</li>
            <li> This smells bad and I just can not get past the way it smells..the oil is good but really smells</li>
            <li> The envelope in which the clear, plastic bottle was shipped arrived soaked through with oil, and the USPS has wrapped the entire thing in a plastic bag &amp;#34;apologizing&amp;#34; for the damage to the package. This package was not shipped properly at all. Additionally, argan oil is supposed to be stored in dark, glass bottles to preserve its quality, not in clear, plastic ones like this one.</li>
            <li> I always read reviews on everything I buy on Amazon &amp; I made the biggest mistake with this product....I failed to read the reviews only because my main focus was finding a large bottle of argan oil and I thought they were all the same....BIG MISTAKE!  This one smells really really rancid just like many of the reviewers say.  It smells like poo seriously like dirty baby diaper! Maybe the bottle I got has gone bad or maybe it just is what it is but either way I&#x27;m returning it.  Heed my warning, I have purchased other smaller bottles of argan oil by other manufacturers and none of them smelled even close to what this one smells like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 60 and have not been one to really take care of my skin. I heard about Argan Oil and thought it would help to moisturize my skin. I live in CO and never had trouble with dry skin like I do here. I noticed a big difference in just a week. I use it before I put my makeup on each morning and again before I go to bed. Would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
