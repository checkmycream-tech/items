            <li>My first bottle of Pecksniffs Grapefruit &amp; Citron Peel hand wash was a gift from my best friend.  </li>
            <li>so it is really nice that Amazon has a US source.  </li>
            <li>Nice for my guest bathroom.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of grapefruit and this is by far the best grapefruit product I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent of this rather pricey hand wash.  </li>
            <li>and I would love to buy more, but can&#x27;t find it anywhere.   </li>
            <li>I wish I could find more of it.  </li>
            <li>and I love love love the product</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s how much I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product but it arrived leaking...  </li>
            <li>Molton Brown does a much better job IMO.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite scent out of Pecksniff&#x27;s line of hand soaps.  </li>
            <li>Would like someone to give me a free sample.</li>
            <li>Decent hand soap...smells great but doesn&#x27;t seem to have much cleaning power.</li>
            <li>I bought this hand wash at Marshall&#x27;s Dept. store not being familiar   with the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Tried it the first time on a whim (picked it up at TJ Maxx) and both my husband and I love it.</li>
            <li>I originally received Pecksniffs Grapefruit &amp; Citron Peel Hand Wash and Lotion as a gift.  </li>
            <li>But this smells sooooo fresh and tart, just like a fresh, ripe, juicy grapefruit but BETTER</li>
            <li>Smells so clean and fresh</li>
            <li>It cleans very well, and leaves hands with the citrus aroma lightly without being too intense.</li>
            <li>I tried to find it online to no avail, so when I stumbled across the Pecksniffs line at TJ Maxx earlier this summer, first I was bummed there was no Freesia &amp; Poppy, but after sniffing each and every product, I fell in love with this one.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li>My first bottle of Pecksniffs was a gift.  </li>
            <li>It cost too much, but I bought it anyway--</li>
            <li>I have to use more soap than expected.</li>
            <li>The smell of this product is so unusual and it stays with you after washing your hands.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really like the fragrance (not overpowering) and the product itself.  </li>
            <li>I really like this hand soap.</li>
            <li>I do mot like heavily scented  soap and lotions buy this lightly scented soap leaves just the right amount of scent on my hands.</li>
            <li>for the quality of the soap, I think a lot of its appeal is the packaging and the fragrance; it seems high quality, like something you&#x27;d pay a lot for at a department store.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brand.</li>
            <li>I live in Albuquerque, NM if you have a distributor in this area</li>
            <li>, other times it&#x27;s too sweet.  </li>
            <li>But Pecksniffs&#x27; soap, while smooth, doesn&#x27;t leave my hands feeling luxuriously moisturized like I would expect; they almost feel a little drier than before I washed them.  </li>
            <li>I seriously hope this will be available very soon!    </li>
            <li>So popular that I have a hard time keeping enough around.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend loves the scent as much as I do and uses this soap every time he washes (which bugs me because I&#x27;m trying to make it last forever because of its scarcity!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It lathers well and ri ses completely without residue.</li>
            <li>I use this in our powder room and get compliments on it frequently.</li>
            <li>I will keep on checking and hoping to find another bottle as mine&#x27;s down to half full.  </li>

            <li> I love the scent of this rather pricey hand wash.  But if you&#x27;re at all disposed towards dry skin, this is unbelievably drying.  Unfortunate.  I got this as a gift, used it a few times, and simply can&#x27;t deal with how dry my hands are from it.  I&#x27;ll have to try another brand.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with the Pecksniffs brand after using the wonderfully perfumey Freesia &amp; Poppy hand soap at my friend&#x27;s vacation home.  I tried to find it online to no avail, so when I stumbled across the Pecksniffs line at TJ Maxx earlier this summer, first I was bummed there was no Freesia &amp; Poppy, but after sniffing each and every product, I fell in love with this one.  When it comes to grapefruit-scented beauty products, sometimes I like the scent, other times it&#x27;s too sweet.  But this smells sooooo fresh and tart, just like a fresh, ripe, juicy grapefruit but BETTER (must be the citron, which admittedly I don&#x27;t even know what that is!).  I want to drink this stuff! My boyfriend loves the scent as much as I do and uses this soap every time he washes (which bugs me because I&#x27;m trying to make it last forever because of its scarcity!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the quality of the soap, I think a lot of its appeal is the packaging and the fragrance; it seems high quality, like something you&#x27;d pay a lot for at a department store.

            <li> ...so it is really nice that Amazon has a US source.  Tried it the first time on a whim (picked it up at TJ Maxx) and both my husband and I love it. Panic set in when I did not buy all they had, and ordering from the UK was costly.Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li> The wife loves this soap!!👍👍👍</li>
            <li> This soap is wonderful.  Everyone who uses it in my guest bath compliments me on it.  I wish I could find more of it.  [...]</li>
            <li> The product is great but the bottle was cracked when we opened the package.</li>
            <li> The smell and the feel of this lotion. Wish I had the perfume. Would like someone to give me a free sample.</li>
            <li> Excellent service and I love love love the product</li>
            <li> My first bottle of Pecksniffs Grapefruit &amp; Citron Peel hand wash was a gift from my best friend.  I love the smell of grapefruit and this is by far the best grapefruit product I&#x27;ve ever tried.  My second bottle was purchased on Amazon.  It cost too much, but I bought it anyway--that&#x27;s how much I love it.  Hopefully, Pecksniffs did not discontinue this product.  I will keep on checking and hoping to find another bottle as mine&#x27;s down to half full.  Will use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> I love this product but it arrived leaking...  Quite a mess.</li>
            <li> Love the feel and love the scent!!!Would buy it and will buy it again!!!Really believe that evertone once trying ...would purchase again!!</li>
            <li> I adore this product!!!!</li>
            <li> Decent hand soap...smells great but doesn&#x27;t seem to have much cleaning power. I have to use more soap than expected. Molton Brown does a much better job IMO.</li>
            <li> Great soap. Smells so clean and fresh</li>
            <li> I love this smooth, delightful hand wash. Smells great too. It lathers well and ri ses completely without residue. Friends ask all the time where I got it.</li>
            <li> The smell of this product is so unusual and it stays with you after washing your hands.&lt;br /&gt;I also have the hand cream which is also great.</li>
            <li> So popular that I have a hard time keeping enough around.</li>
            <li> I originally received Pecksniffs Grapefruit &amp; Citron Peel Hand Wash and Lotion as a gift.  I really like the fragrance (not overpowering) and the product itself.  When it was almost gone, I searched to locate a refill and found it on Amazon.  I use this in our powder room and get compliments on it frequently.</li>
            <li> This one is the best.  However, when I received it, this item along with a second one was not packed well and spilled out onto the wrapping.  I was disappointed in the shipment although I love this item.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent out of Pecksniff&#x27;s line of hand soaps.  I use a different scent in each bathroom and this is the one I use in the kitchen.  I used to buy my hand soap at Bath and Body Works but these have a nicer scent, and if you buy them @ TJ Maxx, they are only $4.99 each!  Such a bargain!! I highly recommend this brand.</li>
            <li> I have used it before--and loved it.  It cleans very well, and leaves hands with the citrus aroma lightly without being too intense.</li>
            <li> I do mot like heavily scented  soap and lotions buy this lightly scented soap leaves just the right amount of scent on my hands. Nice for my guest bathroom.</li>
            <li> My first bottle of Pecksniffs was a gift.  I was immediately impressed.  It actually does moisturize!  I really like this hand soap.</li>
