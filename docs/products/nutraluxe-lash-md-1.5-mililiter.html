            <li>Just swipe across the top lash line before bedtime.</li>
            <li>It works &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>After 4 weeks I had so many people asking me about my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I have told many women about this product and how they need to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Do not use more than once a day your lashes will fall out.</li>

            <li>I get so many compliments about my lashes.</li>

            <li>This seller had the best price by far and sent the product right out.  </li>
            <li>so I could easily show the product to those who asked.</li>
            <li>Easy to use applicator.  </li>
            <li>Quickly!</li>
            <li>On me Smart Lash is amazing.</li>
            <li>My sister experienced the same thing.</li>
            <li>Takes about 1 month to see full results.  </li>
            <li>I have used other lash growth products and been happy with them, but since my friend recommended this one I thought I&#x27;d try it.</li>
            <li>not working a quick as i thought.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I will stop using it due to such a great results!!!</li>
            <li>One eye is responding faster, so i am now just lining the right eye, to catch up.  </li>
            <li>Priced right.</li>
            <li>Please be aware that there is a  Nutraluxe Lash MD formula out there which I find is far better.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had product very long,but am pleased so far.</li>
            <li>This time I&#x27;ve been consistent with usage, once in morning and once at night, after cleansing.</li>
            <li>and I recommended this to so many people that I finally kept a picture of it in my phone</li>
            <li>my first tube was gone</li>
            <li>I can really tell a difference since I&#x27;ve been using this!</li>
            <li>I really did notice longer lashes after using this for a week!</li>
            <li>Does absolutely nothing!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to grow their eyelashes!</li>
            <li>My sister-in-law tried it first</li>
            <li>It works love it and my long lashes will buy again.</li>
            <li>I HAD very sparse lashes and eyebrows NOT NOW, thanks to  this product .</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I would get men and women asking about them and just in shock when I told them they are my real eyelashes.</li>
            <li>This product really does work.</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>It really made my eyelashs grow.</li>
            <li>Warning: be very cautious on who you purchase from.</li>
            <li>And get asked all the time if they are real.</li>
            <li>Enjoy if used properly.</li>
            <li>so I ordered a third tube that I&#x27;m still using, but again am not seeing the original effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a skin reaction, I will say that I have very sensitive allergy eyes, and I was sure I always applied it to my lash line only when it was clean of all product and dry.</li>
            <li>Have tried many different enhancers,but did not get the same results that I do when I use the MD formula.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands of lash enhancers and this one is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>and I got the exact same size bottle 1.5, labeled as 3.0</li>
            <li>Or those long lusty lashes will start to go back to their former shorter selves. :)</li>
            <li>It does seem to be working on my eyebrows though, so for my lashes I&#x27;ve gone back to Smart Lash.</li>
            <li>, I just thought maybe is just filled to the top and kept it since there is no way on knowing how much is inside the bottle, BAD decision, I paid the price for a 3.0 and got a 1.5</li>
            <li>Also, pain when i touch my eyelid near the lash line.</li>
            <li>This works and I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>perhaps not as frequently.  </li>
            <li>However they were not thicker, but that is not advertised as part of what it offers.</li>
            <li>So far my lashes feel softer.</li>
            <li>This merchant has been reliable thus far.</li>
            <li>I purchased a second, but it did not have the same effect as the first.</li>
            <li>Otherwise they can fall out and go back to your normal look.</li>
            <li>my lashes were back to normal in a very short time.</li>
            <li>So much so, I&#x27;m plucking every other day to keep up with the growth.</li>
            <li>The product is amazing but WATCH OUT for wrong quantity product, I have ordered this for three years and the last time I decided to order the 3.0 (double the price of course)</li>
            <li>Unfortunately the very first time I used it I woke up the next morning with very red, very itchy eyes.</li>

            <li> I received regular compliments and questions about how my lashes got so long</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost a year now and will continue to for as long as possible.  </li>
            <li> After about a month of everyday use, my lashes were considerably longer.</li>
            <li> I should have long lashes again soon.</li>
            <li> When I started using this my eyes were extremely bloodshot for several weeks.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my eyelids red or itchy like some other brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> After that, it would sometimes cause an itchy or very minor burning feeling, but not often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I even brush a little on the actual lashes beside the liner area.  </li>
            <li> works well, but not much product in the tube</li>
            <li> And a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this happened, but I had to use it every day or every other day to keep my lash</li>
            <li> Contacted the seller, but the seller would not give a refund due to opened package!</li>
            <li> It was finished just a few months after like the other ones.</li>
            <li> The actual website for the makers charges a ridiculous amount for shipping btw.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are so long and thick</li>
            <li> It helped a little.  </li>
            <li> I did notice that if I stopped using it for a few days (because I had achieved the desired length)</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few months.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your $/people.  </li>
            <li> There are a few tips I have for people that have not seen results.</li>
            <li> Use everyday for results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure of the chemical workings of the product, so</li>
            <li> I had to put at least one star</li>
            <li> This product did what it promised, that is , to grow your lashes without any negative side effects.</li>
            <li> Lashes are slowly growing.</li>
            <li> Everyone thought they had to be fake.</li>
            <li> Try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.  </li>
            <li> I have used this before and it makes your eyelashes grow like crazy.  </li>
            <li> Crazy.  </li>
            <li> I figured I got a bad batch</li>
            <li> No, it made my lashes fall off :(</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Received within a week. I&#x27;ve used this product before and loved it.</li>
            <li> This is excellent product . I use it on my eyebrows, upper and lower lashes. I HAD very sparse lashes and eyebrows NOT NOW, thanks to  this product . I WILL definitely order again. SOON. Also to add I use it twice a day.</li>
            <li> My eyes were really red. Also, pain when i touch my eyelid near the lash line. Contacted the seller, but the seller would not give a refund due to opened package!</li>
            <li> Lashes are longer and fuller now very pleased with product</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t state when you would see results and it&#x27;s been 3 weeks or so. The Latisse seems to be a faster product.</li>
            <li> I started using this product a year ago on my eyelashes. Did not see results, as I was not diligent in applications twice per day. Stopped using it for 6 months. I started noticing eyebrow thinning and lightening and decided to use this on my brows. This time I&#x27;ve been consistent with usage, once in morning and once at night, after cleansing. Within 3 weeks I had darker, thicker, fuller brows. So much so, I&#x27;m plucking every other day to keep up with the growth. My sister felt my brows and commented on the thickness! She&#x27;s buying some for herself now. Believe it. It works if you keep at it. I&#x27;m going buy another for my lashes now and try again.</li>
            <li> This works and I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.  Lashes are longer than ever before.  I even brush a little on the actual lashes beside the liner area.  One eye is responding faster, so i am now just lining the right eye, to catch up.  It is something you need to keep doing, however. perhaps not as frequently.  Or those long lusty lashes will start to go back to their former shorter selves. :)</li>
            <li> The product is amazing but WATCH OUT for wrong quantity product, I have ordered this for three years and the last time I decided to order the 3.0 (double the price of course) and I got the exact same size bottle 1.5, labeled as 3.0, I just thought maybe is just filled to the top and kept it since there is no way on knowing how much is inside the bottle, BAD decision, I paid the price for a 3.0 and got a 1.5 It was finished just a few months after like the other ones. I won&#x27;t order the 3.0 again and won&#x27;t order from the same vendor EVER!</li>
            <li> The first tube of this I had was great. After about a month of everyday use, my lashes were considerably longer. However they were not thicker, but that is not advertised as part of what it offers. I received regular compliments and questions about how my lashes got so long and I recommended this to so many people that I finally kept a picture of it in my phone so I could easily show the product to those who asked. I did notice that if I stopped using it for a few days (because I had achieved the desired length) my lashes were back to normal in a very short time. I&#x27;m not sure of the chemical workings of the product, so I don&#x27;t know how this happened, but I had to use it every day or every other day to keep my lash length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my first tube was gone I purchased a second, but it did not have the same effect as the first. My lashes would get maybe a bit longer, but not noticeably so. I figured I got a bad batch so I ordered a third tube that I&#x27;m still using, but again am not seeing the original effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a skin reaction, I will say that I have very sensitive allergy eyes, and I was sure I always applied it to my lash line only when it was clean of all product and dry. When I started using this my eyes were extremely bloodshot for several weeks. My sister experienced the same thing. After that, it would sometimes cause an itchy or very minor burning feeling, but not often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, this is great for a temporary thing. Say, six months. But in my experience, once you&#x27;ve achieved max length do not stop using or cut back because you will not get that length back again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference using this product. None.</li>
            <li> No, it made my lashes fall off :(</li>
            <li> I have used this item before and I love it. I have recommended it to others.</li>
            <li> It works love it and my long lashes will buy again.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months now. It took about 3-4 weeks to see visible results of my lashes getting longer and thicker. I&#x27;ve tried other brands of lash enhancers and this one is my favorite so far. It doesn&#x27;t make my eyelids red or itchy like some other brands I&#x27;ve used. I will definitely buy NutraLuxe again! And a little goes a long way. Just swipe across the top lash line before bedtime.</li>
            <li> It helped a little.  It&#x27;s Ok.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian so I have no eyelashes but with this stuff I actually do! It works &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> not working a quick as i thought.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few months. After 4 weeks I had so many people asking me about my eyelashes. Everyone thought they had to be fake. I would get men and women asking about them and just in shock when I told them they are my real eyelashes. I have told many women about this product and how they need to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;I am ordering my second tube tonight. Make sure to not stop using it for more than a day or two. Otherwise they can fall out and go back to your normal look.</li>
            <li> Great product!  This is my fourth order...I love it.</li>
            <li> I can really tell a difference since I&#x27;ve been using this!</li>
            <li> This product really does work. Takes about 3 weeks to see results.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Longer thicker lashes.  Great results!  Try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.  Easy to use applicator.  Priced right.</li>
            <li> I have used this before and it makes your eyelashes grow like crazy.  I quit using it and they went back like they were.  Crazy.  This seller had the best price by far and sent the product right out.  I should have long lashes again soon.</li>
            <li> I really did notice longer lashes after using this for a week! I have been getting compliments. This product works and I will continue to use it. ^_^</li>
            <li> My friend recommended this to me. I have used other lash growth products and been happy with them, but since my friend recommended this one I thought I&#x27;d try it. Unfortunately the very first time I used it I woke up the next morning with very red, very itchy eyes. It does seem to be working on my eyebrows though, so for my lashes I&#x27;ve gone back to Smart Lash. On me Smart Lash is amazing.</li>
            <li> Please be aware that there is a  Nutraluxe Lash MD formula out there which I find is far better.  Have tried many different enhancers,but did not get the same results that I do when I use the MD formula.  The bottle looks the same.  Don&#x27;t get duped</li>
            <li> This product really works. I don&#x27;t think I will stop using it due to such a great results!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your $/people.  Does absolutely nothing! I had to put at least one star or they wouldn&#x27;t let my review go online.  NO stars.</li>
            <li> This product did what it promised, that is , to grow your lashes without any negative side effects.</li>
            <li> It really made my eyelashs grow.</li>
            <li> Received quickly,packaged well. So far my lashes feel softer. Haven&#x27;t had product very long,but am pleased so far.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!!  Takes about 1 month to see full results.  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to grow their eyelashes!</li>
            <li> Great stuff with zero side effects!</li>
            <li> This product works amazingly.  The price was good and I am completely happy and will reorder when I need more.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost a year now and will continue to for as long as possible.  There are a few tips I have for people that have not seen results. Do not use more than once a day your lashes will fall out. Thats from experience. You do not need more than one dip. One dip is enough for both eyes. Use everyday for results. It will take about 3 weeks for you to see the progress. Take a before and after photo to show your self. Warning: be very cautious on who you purchase from. This merchant has been reliable thus far. The actual website for the makers charges a ridiculous amount for shipping btw. I get so many compliments about my lashes. And get asked all the time if they are real. Enjoy if used properly.</li>
            <li> This works!  Quickly!</li>
            <li> After chemo my eyelashes would fall out.  Nutraluxe is the only thing I found that would help keep them and even made them grow longer.</li>
            <li> Pretty good product. No complaints. Lashes are slowly growing.</li>
            <li> works well, but not much product in the tube</li>
            <li> I love this product. Every one thinks I have on eyelash extensions. My sister-in-law tried it first and she told me about it. My eyelashes are so long and thick I cant believe a products has that ability.  I  bought a tube for my daughter. It takes about a month to see results. I love it and tell everyone about the product.</li>
            <li> I am usually pleased with the results of this product which is why I periodically order it.</li>
