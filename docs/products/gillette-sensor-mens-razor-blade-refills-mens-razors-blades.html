    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>All I have to say is, \\&quot;THANK GOODNESS!\\&quot; The Sensor3 has the best of both worlds between the Excel and the Mach3.</li>
            <li>, I get a perfect shave just as I did with Mach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gillette Sensor3 System is the best razor</li>
            <li>But, Sensor 3 is the best for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>think I may throw away my panasonic electric razor(it&#x27;s a great razor) and just use the HB with the sensor3 on everything from the shoulders up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Gillette!  </li>
            <li>Perfect and in time!</li>
            <li>The best price I found was on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It does give the best shave</li>
            <li>but, you need to see which is best for you - cream, tube, or mug.  </li>
            <li>and it still is the best brush.</li>
            <li>Excellent product!  </li>
            <li>He is very happy that we can still get it here.  </li>
            <li>The razor handle angle is perfect and the blades gave me a close shave.</li>
            <li>Not the best buy I ever made.</li>
            <li>Best refill for Sensor Razors.</li>
            <li>The company slogan is: the best a man can get.  </li>
            <li>We hope they&#x27;ll keep making these, because the 3 blade option is best for us for optimal performance and flexibility; th quads are just too much of a good thing!</li>
            <li>Finally, very good value.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They were great my husband loves them the best of all the razors.</li>
            <li>Win win win situation...highly suggested</li>
            <li>This product is great.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;d bet that these blades will make you happy.</li>
            <li>What a great buy.</li>
            <li>I am thinking if you were shaving your legs, would be great.  </li>
            <li>Great surprise to find them on Amazon, since some of the discount brick &amp; mortar shops don&#x27;t bother to stock them.</li>
            <li>The product is great and works well with my shaver.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I am just to frugal to buy the latest and greatest razor handle.  </li>
            <li>These razors are easily the best Gillette razors on the market.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a fair trade-off for not being in pain</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a fair trade-off for not being in pain all the time.  </li>
            <li>This 3 bladed cartridge is good</li>
            <li>If I can get a good price I will keep buying the Sensor3 cartridges.</li>
            <li>Good compromise.  </li>
            <li>The blades are just what you would buy in the store but at a good price.</li>
            <li>Got them when Amazon offered a good deal combined with the coupon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used both the Sensor 2 blade and Fusion 5 blade, and these Sensor 3 blades are a good deal for the price.</li>
            <li>I tried with reverse shaving and blades were still in good condition.</li>
            <li>Maybe it is my face, but I find that this razor doesn&#x27;t work as good as the cheaper Gillette sensor.</li>
            <li>They give a good shave and are cheaper than the Mach or Profusion.</li>
            <li>It is nothing fancy handle wise.</li>
            <li>Good product that performs as promised.  </li>
            <li>Good shipment as they arrived before schedule.</li>
            <li>I have had the original Sensor for almost 12 years now, and it still works the best of the ones i have tried.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, the best shaving system ever, was the original Gillette Sensor.</li>
            <li>Sometimes you get exactly what should get,  GOOD QUALITY at a fair price!!!!</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Been using these blades for years, nothing better!</li>
            <li>I got fast service and the item arived in perfect condision.</li>
            <li>shave every day, except for the days I don&#x27;t mind looking like a bum, and I get a good shave for a week on one blade.&lt;br /&gt;The newer razors cost more and cannot reach up under my nose.</li>
            <li>They work nicely.</li>
            <li>My husband refuses to change razors and you can not find these blades in the stores anymore, so he is very happy that I found these and have a subscription to receive a new package every two months.</li>
            <li>very good stuff with a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent razor and I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>By far the best blades I have used.</li>
            <li>It is by far the best cartridge system on the market.  </li>
            <li>besides, isn&#x27;t using a good soothing shaving gel more important?  </li>
            <li>Precise, smooth and feels great.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping and perfect fit for my razor</li>
            <li>did some research and found that my technique (shaving against \\&quot;the grain\\&quot; without shaving with the grain first) was causing a great deal of my problems</li>
            <li>You get way more blade for your buck.  </li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite blade</li>
            <li>The cartridge also sits at a much more pronounced angle than the Mach 3.</li>
            <li>shave: 3 stars.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Durability: 3 stars.</li>
            <li>But the triple edge is so much better.  </li>
            <li>I also like these much better than the disposable triple blades.</li>
            <li>I plan to purchase more</li>
            <li>I wish I could find a better way to shave.</li>
            <li>my girlfriend uses it more than I do</li>
            <li>nothing gillette or anyone else has made does a better job.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m sure they don&#x27;t even make anymore?  </li>
            <li>Everyone is different, but this is the best for my face.  </li>
            <li>Most of the latest men&#x27;s razors have about 5 blades or so, and twist and turn, bend, and all sorts...  </li>
            <li>My fiancee uses it for shaving her legs and likes it better, but I don&#x27;t care for it.</li>
            <li>Even compared to the Mach 3 series for me, the Sensor 3 works better</li>
            <li>The best blades I have used in over 35 years of daily shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am glad that the bid was placed.</li>
            <li>Love Amazon.</li>
            <li>Instead of a blade corroding in say two weeks, you might get four or more weeks.</li>
            <li>I shaved with a brush using cream from a tube or jar as well as soap in a mug for many years.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say much more...</li>
            <li>so much better with three blades than two.</li>
            <li>Sensor 3 is a happy medium and these were reasonable.</li>
            <li>The slim head is much more manageable than the oversized wall of blades of the Mach 3 (which feels like you are just wiping your face with blades, instead of using a razor).  </li>
            <li>Much better than the two blade Sensor refills.</li>
            <li>Better, closer shave.</li>
            <li>Better control closer shave and all around better performance.</li>
            <li>The chartridge hugs your face with more friction, so a close shave takes more effort.  </li>
            <li>Slightly better than a rusty nail.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are my favorite when I can find them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very clean, understated design that feels good in the hand and offers good maneuverability when shaving.</li>
            <li>Stumbled on the three bladed cartridges when replacing the handle and since I do not shave but every four or five days, this cartridge cuts right through for a good three and sometimes four shaves unlike the Sensor 2.</li>
            <li>You can easily find the 2-bladed cartridges, but we like the 3-bladed ones better.  </li>
            <li>The Sensor3 would make a fine choice as a disposable option (and a better choice than the Mach 3 disposable).</li>
            <li>ok, fine, but</li>
            <li>They are much more precise than the 5 and six blade models and cut through thicker beards like mine much more easily than the two blade sensor excel blades.  </li>
            <li>The Sensor 3 blades nick me up more, the Mach 3 again tends to nick me up more as well, and any of the store brand replacement heads for this Sensor just do not work out as well as the original sensor/sensor XL heads.</li>
            <li>The 2 bladed Sensor is more accurate around nose and sideburns</li>
            <li>It has 3 blades instead of 2, so it&#x27;s more comfortable that the 2-blade Senors</li>
            <li>It has 3 blades instead of 2, so it&#x27;s more comfortable that the 2-blade Senors</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s perfectly good for most people, but for a guy like me with sensitive skin it didn&#x27;t work as well as i hoped.  </li>
            <li>Tell Gillette to quit pushing its Mach 3, and to make the Sensor 3 more widely available (though you can still find it at Amazon).</li>
            <li>These razors have the skinniest head of any 3 bladed razors on the market so they fit around the mustache area better than anything else I can find.</li>
            <li>Forget these &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; razors, I get the best shave from this blade than any other.</li>
            <li>Their Sensor3 blades work fine, so of course they&#x27;re becoming scarce.</li>
            <li>Easy to find at Amazon and</li>
            <li>As far as I&#x27;m concerned, this is the best product in their whole line.</li>
            <li>The blades work fine, but the price is just irrational.</li>
            <li>I am fine with the 2 blade sensor but the 3 blade doesn&#x27;t seem to shave as well</li>
            <li>shave was smooth and easy and zero cuts and nicks.  </li>
            <li>Its great to see Gillette has done what store brands have done long ago, add the 3 blade and it does work better than the others, but the two blades seem to give me the closest shave without irritation, and after 12 years that alot of shaving.</li>
            <li>I continue to use these older style of cartridge because they are well made, hold their edge for a good week of shaves and give a clean shave without razor burn.</li>
            <li>Get the best pure badger hair brush you can, they last a lifetime!</li>
            <li>I found that my face needed a day or 2 off before I could shave comfortably again.</li>
            <li>The cartridges are still available in some stores, however.</li>
            <li>Really enjoy the feeling and smooth shave</li>
            <li>The results are smooth and comfortable.</li>
            <li>I can’t fit the four blade types around my nose for detail work.</li>
            <li>And Amazon delivered at an inexpensive price with free shipping...</li>
            <li>The cartridges came very fast, they are quite OK, and I am using them for shaving.</li>
            <li>I started off as a teenager with the original Sensor.</li>
            <li>amazon.com appears to have the best price so far - shipping free plus no tax is a big plus.</li>
            <li>With one shave drive makes face clean.</li>
            <li>Sensor 3 gives me a nice comfortable shave (I use with Nivia Shave Gel for sensitive skin).  </li>
            <li>Work well and provide a clean shave</li>
            <li>I had to keep my old Sensor handy to tackle that area when I was done with the rest of my face.</li>
            <li>The Gillette Sensor3 cartridges strike a great balance between the three blade cutting power of the popular Mach 3 razors and the deft handling of the Sensor Excel.  </li>
            <li>I make sure it is rinsed of hair and foam, then I shake it, tap it on my towel, then wipe the whole thing.</li>
            <li>At the price what more could I ask and they came in a timely manner, thanks so much:)</li>
            <li>I did not test these cartridges for durability, as I quickly realized that the Sensor3 disposable blade is identical to the Sensor3 cartridges.</li>
            <li>Its work pretty good, but Mach3 works better, stay sharp longer.&lt;br /&gt;Already try all the 4/5 blade type on the market as well, power or not, nothing come close to the Mach3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They have to keep trying to top themselves with new products of dubious value.</li>
            <li>Still using these blades, easy on the face and very close shave.</li>
            <li>This overall design allows for more precision shaving--areas below the nose and around the sideburns are relatively easy to cut as a result.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But very soon it all worked out fine</li>
            <li>FINALLY, the original super accurate sensor comes with three blades!  </li>
            <li>Even the shipping was reasonably fast and free.</li>
            <li>A straight sturdy razor blade like this is all a man needs if you want it smooth.</li>
            <li>how is it i got a better shave with that really old gillette razor</li>
            <li>and I do not get any nicks or cuts as I have on rare occasions from the Mach 3.</li>
            <li>Closer and more comfortable than the Sensor Excel, and these last longer as well.</li>
            <li>I tried using many other blades/Cartridges, but I was facing many cuts during shaving.</li>
            <li>I recommend them to anybody who has the right handle.</li>
            <li>After spending years trying to find the right combitnation of blades and creams, I think I&#x27;ve found what works for</li>
            <li>the price is right.</li>
            <li>Three blades moving in the right direction with an aloe vera strip for smoothness.</li>
            <li>The cartridge is nice and slim ...not as slim as the twin blade, but I can still easily get in the space between my lip and nose which I have trouble doing with the 4 and 5 blade systems</li>
            <li>Open back facilitates flushing, heavier end caps make great stability.</li>
            <li>It appeared a good idea except for one little problem.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find the 3 blades, so it&#x27;s great finding it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Guys, your woman will DEFINITELY think it&#x27;s sexy when she sees you lathering up if you go that route.</li>
            <li>Guys, your woman will DEFINITELY think it&#x27;s sexy when she sees you lathering up if you go that route.</li>
            <li>Blades will last a week at most, perhaps three to four shaves at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:</li>
            <li>Or, if you are particularly interested in the Sensor family of razors, choose the SensorExcel.</li>

            <li>Whenever someone tells me they can&#x27;t find something they are looking for, I tell them to go to amazon.com, because we have found and ordered many different products from this company.  </li>
            <li>bubble&amp;#34; in the first three-quarters inch of each tube that I can rely upon to feel cheated.]</li>
            <li>Exactly as ordered.</li>
            <li>first off</li>
            <li>and now i&#x27;m curious what kind of performance i would get with a mach 3......</li>
            <li>I used these cartridges as replacement blades for my headblade (to shave my head) for the first time yesterday.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-closer shave than I&#x27;ve had from any electric or from Headblade double or triple and definately better than the Gillette Mach 3 and Mach 3 turbo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am using the first blade.</li>
            <li>Really!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>any more words left?</li>
            <li>The blades fit any Sensor handle, which is a more traditional feel than the initially-awkward feel of the Mach3, so I didn&#x27;t have to invest in a whole new system.</li>
            <li>the right blade or, nowadays, blades in a disposable, really depends on your face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These are Gillettes best effort with the small head and 3 blades and they are hard to find any more.</li>
            <li>It works better on a flat area, like legs for example.</li>
            <li>The Gillette Company makes many terrific products, but their marketing department can&#x27;t just accept that and keep making good products with small improvements.</li>
            <li>As a result I could shave down my beard in fewer passes than with a 2-blade Sensor Excel, AND trim my sideburns and below my nose more cleanly than with a Mach 3.  </li>
            <li>But the best part is I can shave WITH the grain and get a very acceptable, although not perfect, results.</li>
            <li>But the best part is I can shave WITH the grain and get a very acceptable, although not perfect, results.</li>
            <li>Pretty soon their shaving cartridges will have 20 blades and be as large as tennis rackets.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting a good, close shave with very little irritation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting a good, close shave with very little irritation and ingrowns.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update 20130520:&lt;br /&gt;After long term testing/usage against the Mach3, Mach3 perform so much better and</li>
            <li>With this order of 5 packs, I have had to discard each of 4 new blades from the first pack after just one or two strokes!  </li>
            <li>Guess this is what I get for not reading product description a little better!</li>
            <li>These new Sensor blades use the more traditional handle design with quality blades you expect from Gillette.</li>
            <li>These new Sensor blades use the more traditional handle design with a the quality blades you expect from Gillette.  </li>
            <li>If you are only marginally happy with the other Gillette blades I highly recommend trying these out.</li>
            <li>The racks in stores are filled with their new, more expensive products that don&#x27;t really work that much better.</li>
            <li>Good blades that are hard to find in stores anymore.  </li>
            <li>The blades were cheaper than the Mach3 (even at Costco Warehouse prices), so it wasn&#x27;t much of an investment for the experiment.</li>
            <li>Stop wasting your money on crappy gimmicks with batteries and get the real deal.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>VERY DISAPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>Buying on-line is so much easier than checking the store shelves each week.</li>
            <li>I think the manufactures made cartridges years ago that really gave a close shave but must stopped because of, who knows, complaints of nicks???</li>
            <li>I really like them.</li>
            <li>Like the Sensor Excel and the Sensor 3, they give you a comfortable shave but not a close shave by any stretch because THEY DON&#x27;T GET CLOSE ENOUGH TO THE SKIN!</li>
            <li>The razors really glide on your face but don&#x27;t cut much.</li>
            <li>If you are looing for the real deal in a hurry..this is it</li>
            <li>Just what I wanted as they are available locally.  </li>
            <li>Only good for two to three shaves and they drag on your skin.  </li>
            <li>Most young men ONLY NEED two blades!</li>
            <li>In the NY-NJ area, the supermarket chain, Shoprite, sells equivalent blades under their own brand name that work the same as the CVS Flexx and are actually cheaper still.  </li>

            <li>8 years ago i first shaved with a twin-blade gillette, but it seemed every bit as technically advanced as this (minus one blade), shaved fast</li>
            <li>I like it better than the 4 blade design due to the compact size.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Replacement Cartridges had a different head than original.  </li>
            <li>strongly believe that they added the third and fourth blade in the systems only to justify charging 20% or more for a additional piece of metal that costs them a fraction of a penny.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>For the price, the design is pretty good but not great.</li>
            <li>I found there to be a great deal of drag with only a couple of days&#x27; facial hair growth.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re long-lasting - and getting more difficult to find in regular stores, so we were delighted to find that they could be purchased on Amazon.</li>
            <li>They are getting more and more expensive as time goes by like everything else..</li>
            <li>This is a decent price but, fundamentally, overpriced even at a discount.&lt;br /&gt;Picking</li>
            <li>these 3 blade inserst are not available locally and it was good to get them off line.</li>
            <li>I always used sensor 2 due to agility of 2 blades, but decided to try these and glad I did, do a much better job without any cuts and last a long time.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Sensor 3 razor.</li>
            <li>now shave daily with hardly any irritation, and on special occassions when I need my shave to be extra close, I re-lather after the first go around, shave lightly against the grain, and I&#x27;m as smooth as a baby&#x27;s backside.</li>
            <li>now shave daily with hardly any irritation, and on special occassions when I need my shave to be extra close, I re-lather after the first go around, shave lightly against the grain, and I&#x27;m as smooth as a baby&#x27;s backside.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on these blades !!  </li>
            <li>My fiancee suggested spending $20 on the new battery-powered Mach3...</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it...</li>
            <li>(Am I the only one who noticed that?)&lt;br /&gt;So, why isn&#x27;t this blade available at my local Wal-mart?</li>
            <li>This comfort factor alone is, to me, worth the additional cost over the Excel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, our faces are all different, and \\&quot;your results may vary.\\&quot; But I would recommend buying a pack of Sensor3 and trying them out, you may be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>i do have very sensitive skin, and i already had some razor burn there</li>
            <li>I think I FINALLY found something that works for me after 15 years of shaving!traditional feel than the initially-awkward feel of the Mach3, so I didn&#x27;t have to invest in a whole new system.</li>
            <li>They arrived before the expected date, they were sharp, they fit, matter of fact, they are exactly what I could buy in the store(when</li>
            <li>My husband is super picky and won&#x27;t use any other razor than the one he has.</li>
            <li>I believe they also fit the original Sensor handle), throw out the useless blades and buy the CVS Flexx blades that fit the Gillette handle (at abouth half the price).</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the amount of resistance I encountered when shaving.</li>
            <li>, I have to go over spots frequently.  </li>
            <li>I want you to go to your bathroom and pick up that mideival looking 17 blade electric vibrating razor that you are using and throw it as far in the woods as you can.  </li>
            <li>I had the old gilette handle which took these blades.  </li>
            <li>Having the blades shipped to me automatically on a regular basis is very convenient.</li>
            <li>Each time we look for these blades, they are in a locked cabinet and we need to find an attendant to open the cabinet so we can purchase it.  </li>
            <li>However, their edges don&#x27;t seem to last very well.</li>
            <li>(going so far as putting leaflets in the Sensor Excel, telling you to switch the Mach 3), stick with this old standby.  </li>
            <li>and I actually get a few more shaves.</li>
            <li>These do a good job, but why are razor blades so expensive - wherever you buy them?</li>
            <li>Works fine over wide flat spaces, so</li>
            <li>Subject line pretty much says it all.</li>
            <li>This razor is more accurate, cuts closer and is less irritating than the Mach 3.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been shaving with a rotary electric for a long time, but decided to try razor shaving for more closeness and less irritation (the two things all us guys want!)  </li>
            <li>They provide a smooth shave with very few nicks.  </li>
            <li>close shave, gets hard to reach areas and able to use multiple times.</li>
            <li>The razors today simply do not shave close enough, really.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste money on more expensive newer models, if you have this one or can get this one, blades are cheaper and it does better, Gillette sensor blades last longer.</li>
            <li>I was never a fan of the Mach 3 design because I could never find the right angle to shave with the odd handle/blade design.  </li>
            <li>, these feel very clumsy and leave too many spots unshaven for me.  </li>
            <li>Lubrication is minimal, and one wonders if there really is something to the design of the Mach 3/Fusion razors.</li>
            <li>, so I started to change my ways with less than stellar results.</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive skin, after trying every major brand these new Sensor Blades finally give me what I want: a close shave with minimal irritation.</li>
            <li>Despite Gillette&#x27;s constant efforts to make you buy the new (and more expensive)</li>
            <li>Blades are so expensive now that it&#x27;s nice to get a discount and a regular shipment.</li>
            <li>After trying every major brand of electric razors, the Mach 3 turbo, and the Schick Quattro, these new Sensor Blades finally give me what I want:  a close shave with minimal irritation.  </li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> All I have to say is, \\&quot;THANK GOODNESS!\\&quot; The Sensor3 has the best of both worlds between the Excel and the Mach3.</li>
            <li> , I get a perfect shave just as I did with Mach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gillette Sensor3 System is the best razor</li>
            <li> But, Sensor 3 is the best for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> think I may throw away my panasonic electric razor(it&#x27;s a great razor) and just use the HB with the sensor3 on everything from the shoulders up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Gillette!  </li>
            <li> Perfect and in time!</li>
            <li> The best price I found was on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It does give the best shave</li>
            <li> but, you need to see which is best for you - cream, tube, or mug.  </li>
            <li> and it still is the best brush.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  </li>
            <li> He is very happy that we can still get it here.  </li>
            <li> The razor handle angle is perfect and the blades gave me a close shave.</li>
            <li> Not the best buy I ever made.</li>
            <li> Best refill for Sensor Razors.</li>
            <li> The company slogan is: the best a man can get.  </li>
            <li> We hope they&#x27;ll keep making these, because the 3 blade option is best for us for optimal performance and flexibility; th quads are just too much of a good thing!</li>
            <li> Finally, very good value.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They were great my husband loves them the best of all the razors.</li>
            <li> Win win win situation...highly suggested</li>
            <li> This product is great.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;d bet that these blades will make you happy.</li>
            <li> What a great buy.</li>
            <li> I am thinking if you were shaving your legs, would be great.  </li>
            <li> Great surprise to find them on Amazon, since some of the discount brick &amp; mortar shops don&#x27;t bother to stock them.</li>
            <li> The product is great and works well with my shaver.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I am just to frugal to buy the latest and greatest razor handle.  </li>
            <li> These razors are easily the best Gillette razors on the market.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a fair trade-off for not being in pain</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a fair trade-off for not being in pain all the time.  </li>
            <li> This 3 bladed cartridge is good</li>
            <li> If I can get a good price I will keep buying the Sensor3 cartridges.</li>
            <li> Good compromise.  </li>
            <li> The blades are just what you would buy in the store but at a good price.</li>
            <li> Got them when Amazon offered a good deal combined with the coupon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both the Sensor 2 blade and Fusion 5 blade, and these Sensor 3 blades are a good deal for the price.</li>
            <li> I tried with reverse shaving and blades were still in good condition.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is my face, but I find that this razor doesn&#x27;t work as good as the cheaper Gillette sensor.</li>
            <li> They give a good shave and are cheaper than the Mach or Profusion.</li>
            <li> It is nothing fancy handle wise.</li>
            <li> Good product that performs as promised.  </li>
            <li> Good shipment as they arrived before schedule.</li>
            <li> I have had the original Sensor for almost 12 years now, and it still works the best of the ones i have tried.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, the best shaving system ever, was the original Gillette Sensor.</li>
            <li> Sometimes you get exactly what should get,  GOOD QUALITY at a fair price!!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Been using these blades for years, nothing better!</li>
            <li> I got fast service and the item arived in perfect condision.</li>
            <li> shave every day, except for the days I don&#x27;t mind looking like a bum, and I get a good shave for a week on one blade.&lt;br /&gt;The newer razors cost more and cannot reach up under my nose.</li>
            <li> They work nicely.</li>
            <li> My husband refuses to change razors and you can not find these blades in the stores anymore, so he is very happy that I found these and have a subscription to receive a new package every two months.</li>
            <li> very good stuff with a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent razor and I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> By far the best blades I have used.</li>
            <li> It is by far the best cartridge system on the market.  </li>
            <li> besides, isn&#x27;t using a good soothing shaving gel more important?  </li>
            <li> Precise, smooth and feels great.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping and perfect fit for my razor</li>
            <li> did some research and found that my technique (shaving against \\&quot;the grain\\&quot; without shaving with the grain first) was causing a great deal of my problems</li>
            <li> You get way more blade for your buck.  </li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite blade</li>
            <li> The cartridge also sits at a much more pronounced angle than the Mach 3.</li>
            <li> shave: 3 stars.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Durability: 3 stars.</li>
            <li> But the triple edge is so much better.  </li>
            <li> I also like these much better than the disposable triple blades.</li>
            <li> I plan to purchase more</li>
            <li> I wish I could find a better way to shave.</li>
            <li> my girlfriend uses it more than I do</li>
            <li> nothing gillette or anyone else has made does a better job.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m sure they don&#x27;t even make anymore?  </li>
            <li> Everyone is different, but this is the best for my face.  </li>
            <li> Most of the latest men&#x27;s razors have about 5 blades or so, and twist and turn, bend, and all sorts...  </li>
            <li> My fiancee uses it for shaving her legs and likes it better, but I don&#x27;t care for it.</li>
            <li> Even compared to the Mach 3 series for me, the Sensor 3 works better</li>
            <li> The best blades I have used in over 35 years of daily shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am glad that the bid was placed.</li>
            <li> Love Amazon.</li>
            <li> Instead of a blade corroding in say two weeks, you might get four or more weeks.</li>
            <li> I shaved with a brush using cream from a tube or jar as well as soap in a mug for many years.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say much more...</li>
            <li> so much better with three blades than two.</li>
            <li> Sensor 3 is a happy medium and these were reasonable.</li>
            <li> The slim head is much more manageable than the oversized wall of blades of the Mach 3 (which feels like you are just wiping your face with blades, instead of using a razor).  </li>
            <li> Much better than the two blade Sensor refills.</li>
            <li> Better, closer shave.</li>
            <li> Better control closer shave and all around better performance.</li>
            <li> The chartridge hugs your face with more friction, so a close shave takes more effort.  </li>
            <li> Slightly better than a rusty nail.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are my favorite when I can find them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very clean, understated design that feels good in the hand and offers good maneuverability when shaving.</li>
            <li> Stumbled on the three bladed cartridges when replacing the handle and since I do not shave but every four or five days, this cartridge cuts right through for a good three and sometimes four shaves unlike the Sensor 2.</li>
            <li> You can easily find the 2-bladed cartridges, but we like the 3-bladed ones better.  </li>
            <li> The Sensor3 would make a fine choice as a disposable option (and a better choice than the Mach 3 disposable).</li>
            <li> ok, fine, but</li>
            <li> They are much more precise than the 5 and six blade models and cut through thicker beards like mine much more easily than the two blade sensor excel blades.  </li>
            <li> The Sensor 3 blades nick me up more, the Mach 3 again tends to nick me up more as well, and any of the store brand replacement heads for this Sensor just do not work out as well as the original sensor/sensor XL heads.</li>
            <li> The 2 bladed Sensor is more accurate around nose and sideburns</li>
            <li> It has 3 blades instead of 2, so it&#x27;s more comfortable that the 2-blade Senors</li>
            <li> It has 3 blades instead of 2, so it&#x27;s more comfortable that the 2-blade Senors</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s perfectly good for most people, but for a guy like me with sensitive skin it didn&#x27;t work as well as i hoped.  </li>
            <li> Tell Gillette to quit pushing its Mach 3, and to make the Sensor 3 more widely available (though you can still find it at Amazon).</li>
            <li> These razors have the skinniest head of any 3 bladed razors on the market so they fit around the mustache area better than anything else I can find.</li>
            <li> Forget these &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; razors, I get the best shave from this blade than any other.</li>
            <li> Their Sensor3 blades work fine, so of course they&#x27;re becoming scarce.</li>
            <li> Easy to find at Amazon and</li>
            <li> As far as I&#x27;m concerned, this is the best product in their whole line.</li>
            <li> The blades work fine, but the price is just irrational.</li>
            <li> I am fine with the 2 blade sensor but the 3 blade doesn&#x27;t seem to shave as well</li>
            <li> shave was smooth and easy and zero cuts and nicks.  </li>
            <li> Its great to see Gillette has done what store brands have done long ago, add the 3 blade and it does work better than the others, but the two blades seem to give me the closest shave without irritation, and after 12 years that alot of shaving.</li>
            <li> I continue to use these older style of cartridge because they are well made, hold their edge for a good week of shaves and give a clean shave without razor burn.</li>
            <li> Get the best pure badger hair brush you can, they last a lifetime!</li>
            <li> I found that my face needed a day or 2 off before I could shave comfortably again.</li>
            <li> The cartridges are still available in some stores, however.</li>
            <li> Really enjoy the feeling and smooth shave</li>
            <li> The results are smooth and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I can’t fit the four blade types around my nose for detail work.</li>
            <li> And Amazon delivered at an inexpensive price with free shipping...</li>
            <li> The cartridges came very fast, they are quite OK, and I am using them for shaving.</li>
            <li> I started off as a teenager with the original Sensor.</li>
            <li> amazon.com appears to have the best price so far - shipping free plus no tax is a big plus.</li>
            <li> With one shave drive makes face clean.</li>
            <li> Sensor 3 gives me a nice comfortable shave (I use with Nivia Shave Gel for sensitive skin).  </li>
            <li> Work well and provide a clean shave</li>
            <li> I had to keep my old Sensor handy to tackle that area when I was done with the rest of my face.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Sensor3 cartridges strike a great balance between the three blade cutting power of the popular Mach 3 razors and the deft handling of the Sensor Excel.  </li>
            <li> I make sure it is rinsed of hair and foam, then I shake it, tap it on my towel, then wipe the whole thing.</li>
            <li> At the price what more could I ask and they came in a timely manner, thanks so much:)</li>
            <li> I did not test these cartridges for durability, as I quickly realized that the Sensor3 disposable blade is identical to the Sensor3 cartridges.</li>
            <li> Its work pretty good, but Mach3 works better, stay sharp longer.&lt;br /&gt;Already try all the 4/5 blade type on the market as well, power or not, nothing come close to the Mach3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They have to keep trying to top themselves with new products of dubious value.</li>
            <li> Still using these blades, easy on the face and very close shave.</li>
            <li> This overall design allows for more precision shaving--areas below the nose and around the sideburns are relatively easy to cut as a result.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But very soon it all worked out fine</li>
            <li> FINALLY, the original super accurate sensor comes with three blades!  </li>
            <li> Even the shipping was reasonably fast and free.</li>
            <li> A straight sturdy razor blade like this is all a man needs if you want it smooth.</li>
            <li> how is it i got a better shave with that really old gillette razor</li>
            <li> and I do not get any nicks or cuts as I have on rare occasions from the Mach 3.</li>
            <li> Closer and more comfortable than the Sensor Excel, and these last longer as well.</li>
            <li> I tried using many other blades/Cartridges, but I was facing many cuts during shaving.</li>
            <li> I recommend them to anybody who has the right handle.</li>
            <li> After spending years trying to find the right combitnation of blades and creams, I think I&#x27;ve found what works for</li>
            <li> the price is right.</li>
            <li> Three blades moving in the right direction with an aloe vera strip for smoothness.</li>
            <li> The cartridge is nice and slim ...not as slim as the twin blade, but I can still easily get in the space between my lip and nose which I have trouble doing with the 4 and 5 blade systems</li>
            <li> Open back facilitates flushing, heavier end caps make great stability.</li>
            <li> It appeared a good idea except for one little problem.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find the 3 blades, so it&#x27;s great finding it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Guys, your woman will DEFINITELY think it&#x27;s sexy when she sees you lathering up if you go that route.</li>
            <li> Guys, your woman will DEFINITELY think it&#x27;s sexy when she sees you lathering up if you go that route.</li>
            <li> Blades will last a week at most, perhaps three to four shaves at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:</li>

            <li> Whenever someone tells me they can&#x27;t find something they are looking for, I tell them to go to amazon.com, because we have found and ordered many different products from this company.  </li>
            <li> bubble&amp;#34; in the first three-quarters inch of each tube that I can rely upon to feel cheated.]</li>
            <li> Exactly as ordered.</li>
            <li> first off</li>
            <li> and now i&#x27;m curious what kind of performance i would get with a mach 3......</li>
            <li> I used these cartridges as replacement blades for my headblade (to shave my head) for the first time yesterday.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-closer shave than I&#x27;ve had from any electric or from Headblade double or triple and definately better than the Gillette Mach 3 and Mach 3 turbo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am using the first blade.</li>
            <li> Really!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> any more words left?</li>
            <li> The blades fit any Sensor handle, which is a more traditional feel than the initially-awkward feel of the Mach3, so I didn&#x27;t have to invest in a whole new system.</li>
            <li> the right blade or, nowadays, blades in a disposable, really depends on your face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> These are Gillettes best effort with the small head and 3 blades and they are hard to find any more.</li>
            <li> It works better on a flat area, like legs for example.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Company makes many terrific products, but their marketing department can&#x27;t just accept that and keep making good products with small improvements.</li>
            <li> As a result I could shave down my beard in fewer passes than with a 2-blade Sensor Excel, AND trim my sideburns and below my nose more cleanly than with a Mach 3.  </li>
            <li> But the best part is I can shave WITH the grain and get a very acceptable, although not perfect, results.</li>

            <li> Pretty soon their shaving cartridges will have 20 blades and be as large as tennis rackets.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting a good, close shave with very little irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting a good, close shave with very little irritation and ingrowns.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update 20130520:&lt;br /&gt;After long term testing/usage against the Mach3, Mach3 perform so much better and</li>
            <li> With this order of 5 packs, I have had to discard each of 4 new blades from the first pack after just one or two strokes!  </li>
            <li> Guess this is what I get for not reading product description a little better!</li>
            <li> These new Sensor blades use the more traditional handle design with quality blades you expect from Gillette.</li>

            <li> If you are only marginally happy with the other Gillette blades I highly recommend trying these out.</li>
            <li> The racks in stores are filled with their new, more expensive products that don&#x27;t really work that much better.</li>
            <li> Good blades that are hard to find in stores anymore.  </li>
            <li> The blades were cheaper than the Mach3 (even at Costco Warehouse prices), so it wasn&#x27;t much of an investment for the experiment.</li>
            <li> Stop wasting your money on crappy gimmicks with batteries and get the real deal.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> VERY DISAPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Buying on-line is so much easier than checking the store shelves each week.</li>
            <li> I think the manufactures made cartridges years ago that really gave a close shave but must stopped because of, who knows, complaints of nicks???</li>
            <li> I really like them.</li>
            <li> Like the Sensor Excel and the Sensor 3, they give you a comfortable shave but not a close shave by any stretch because THEY DON&#x27;T GET CLOSE ENOUGH TO THE SKIN!</li>
            <li> The razors really glide on your face but don&#x27;t cut much.</li>
            <li> If you are looing for the real deal in a hurry..this is it</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted as they are available locally.  </li>
            <li> Only good for two to three shaves and they drag on your skin.  </li>
            <li> Most young men ONLY NEED two blades!</li>
            <li> In the NY-NJ area, the supermarket chain, Shoprite, sells equivalent blades under their own brand name that work the same as the CVS Flexx and are actually cheaper still.  </li>

            <li> 8 years ago i first shaved with a twin-blade gillette, but it seemed every bit as technically advanced as this (minus one blade), shaved fast</li>
            <li> I like it better than the 4 blade design due to the compact size.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Replacement Cartridges had a different head than original.  </li>
            <li> strongly believe that they added the third and fourth blade in the systems only to justify charging 20% or more for a additional piece of metal that costs them a fraction of a penny.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> For the price, the design is pretty good but not great.</li>
            <li> I found there to be a great deal of drag with only a couple of days&#x27; facial hair growth.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re long-lasting - and getting more difficult to find in regular stores, so we were delighted to find that they could be purchased on Amazon.</li>
            <li> They are getting more and more expensive as time goes by like everything else..</li>
            <li> This is a decent price but, fundamentally, overpriced even at a discount.&lt;br /&gt;Picking</li>
            <li> these 3 blade inserst are not available locally and it was good to get them off line.</li>
            <li> I always used sensor 2 due to agility of 2 blades, but decided to try these and glad I did, do a much better job without any cuts and last a long time.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Sensor 3 razor.</li>
            <li> now shave daily with hardly any irritation, and on special occassions when I need my shave to be extra close, I re-lather after the first go around, shave lightly against the grain, and I&#x27;m as smooth as a baby&#x27;s backside.</li>

            <li> Do not waste your money on these blades !!  </li>
            <li> My fiancee suggested spending $20 on the new battery-powered Mach3...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it...</li>
            <li> (Am I the only one who noticed that?)&lt;br /&gt;So, why isn&#x27;t this blade available at my local Wal-mart?</li>
            <li> This comfort factor alone is, to me, worth the additional cost over the Excel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, our faces are all different, and \\&quot;your results may vary.\\&quot; But I would recommend buying a pack of Sensor3 and trying them out, you may be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> i do have very sensitive skin, and i already had some razor burn there</li>
            <li> I think I FINALLY found something that works for me after 15 years of shaving!traditional feel than the initially-awkward feel of the Mach3, so I didn&#x27;t have to invest in a whole new system.</li>
            <li> They arrived before the expected date, they were sharp, they fit, matter of fact, they are exactly what I could buy in the store(when</li>
            <li> My husband is super picky and won&#x27;t use any other razor than the one he has.</li>
            <li> I believe they also fit the original Sensor handle), throw out the useless blades and buy the CVS Flexx blades that fit the Gillette handle (at abouth half the price).</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the amount of resistance I encountered when shaving.</li>
            <li> , I have to go over spots frequently.  </li>
            <li> I want you to go to your bathroom and pick up that mideival looking 17 blade electric vibrating razor that you are using and throw it as far in the woods as you can.  </li>
            <li> I had the old gilette handle which took these blades.  </li>
            <li> Having the blades shipped to me automatically on a regular basis is very convenient.</li>
            <li> Each time we look for these blades, they are in a locked cabinet and we need to find an attendant to open the cabinet so we can purchase it.  </li>
            <li> However, their edges don&#x27;t seem to last very well.</li>
            <li> (going so far as putting leaflets in the Sensor Excel, telling you to switch the Mach 3), stick with this old standby.  </li>
            <li> and I actually get a few more shaves.</li>
            <li> These do a good job, but why are razor blades so expensive - wherever you buy them?</li>
            <li> Works fine over wide flat spaces, so</li>
            <li> Subject line pretty much says it all.</li>
            <li> This razor is more accurate, cuts closer and is less irritating than the Mach 3.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been shaving with a rotary electric for a long time, but decided to try razor shaving for more closeness and less irritation (the two things all us guys want!)  </li>
            <li> They provide a smooth shave with very few nicks.  </li>
            <li> close shave, gets hard to reach areas and able to use multiple times.</li>
            <li> The razors today simply do not shave close enough, really.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money on more expensive newer models, if you have this one or can get this one, blades are cheaper and it does better, Gillette sensor blades last longer.</li>
            <li> I was never a fan of the Mach 3 design because I could never find the right angle to shave with the odd handle/blade design.  </li>
            <li> , these feel very clumsy and leave too many spots unshaven for me.  </li>
            <li> Lubrication is minimal, and one wonders if there really is something to the design of the Mach 3/Fusion razors.</li>
            <li> , so I started to change my ways with less than stellar results.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive skin, after trying every major brand these new Sensor Blades finally give me what I want: a close shave with minimal irritation.</li>
            <li> Despite Gillette&#x27;s constant efforts to make you buy the new (and more expensive)</li>
            <li> Blades are so expensive now that it&#x27;s nice to get a discount and a regular shipment.</li>
            <li> After trying every major brand of electric razors, the Mach 3 turbo, and the Schick Quattro, these new Sensor Blades finally give me what I want:  a close shave with minimal irritation.  </li>
            <li> My husband has been using these razors for a long time because these seem to be the only ones that don&#x27;t leave him all bloodied up.</li>
            <li> There is no particular benefit to the third blade in the Sensor family.o choose the Mach 3 Turbo for overall comfort.</li>
            <li> It seems that the various shaving system companies decided to appeal only to the more \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; men out there who might faint at the sight of a little bit of blood caused by an occasional nik.</li>
            <li> Yes, it did give me an occasional nik, but that&#x27;s because the blades actually get close enough to the skin to cut the hair - plain and simple, no technical jargon required.</li>
            <li> There is no particular benefit to the third blade in the Sensor family.</li>
            <li> The are just as sharp and last as long as the ones purchased locally.</li>
            <li> , I had minor cuts on the neck where the skin is thinner.</li>
            <li> Lasts as long as any I have used.</li>
            <li> recent Gillette cartridges IMO have too many blades, which, for my face, makes it very difficult to reach under the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a much better shave than the 2 blade, and less expensive the Fusion 5 blade.</li>
            <li> An 8 count usually last 6 months with shaving every other day.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t been useing it for very long.</li>
            <li> The blades are predictably reliable, especially the fourth of each rack.  </li>
            <li> They are so rough that they would have taken half my face off: the last time I encountered blades of such roughness was in Cambodia.  </li>
            <li> and I do not like the cartridges with the single blade.  </li>
            <li> This sensor excel line of razors shaves my dark facial hair closer than anything I have ever used ever, and I don&#x27;t even feel it.  </li>
            <li> After getting used to the two blade version, using these are a big step down in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> These blades are very sharp and they give me such a close shave</li>
            <li> LESS IRRITATION than with any of the above products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But, I don&#x27;t and trying to shave around tight spots like upper lip and chin</li>
            <li> That little area under your nose is reason enough to avoid the Mach 3.</li>
            <li> Well, there&#x27;s not much to tell.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> These work as expected.  </li>
            <li> I got exactly as I expected.  </li>
            <li> Also, when I forgot my razor in a vacation resort, I was forced to use my wife&#x27;s Gillette Venus razor and found it to work unexpectedly well.  </li>
            <li> Also, when I forgot my razor in a vacation resort, I was forced to use my wife&#x27;s Gillette Venus razor and found it to work unexpectedly well.  </li>
            <li> All those gimmicky razors flat out suck.  </li>
            <li> Well, after about a week of daily use with the Excel, my neck was about as raw and sore as it ever had been.</li>
            <li> had been using Sensor Excel and decided to try the Sensor3 based on other reviews.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still sharp as a comedian after a couple of months.  </li>
            <li> luckily my other cheek, chin and under nose were spared.  </li>
            <li> the secret to making blades last a long time is to DRY THEM when you are done.</li>
            <li> Worse yet, it seems much more difficult to reach under my nose.  </li>
            <li> They actually perform the same as the eccellent extinct Sensor blades</li>
            <li> the lubricating strip is useless IMHO because you have to hold it a certain way for it to contact.  </li>
            <li> so i have to rate this as a 3 stars, average razor.  </li>
            <li> As a man who shaves his head, I&#x27;ve really come to rely on these blades, but dang they are expensive in the store.</li>
            <li> With Gillette offering several varieties of the Mach 3, the Sensor3 system has been slowly ported over from a cartridge-based system to a disposable one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also invested in a few other items that have added to my comfort.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also invested in a few other items that have added to my comfort.</li>
            <li> Half the time...i can&#x27;t even find these blades in stock.</li>
            <li> My face is noticeably less irritated with the Sensor3.</li>
            <li> I just feel like it glides faster even though the blade coverage is less than the 4 blade design.  </li>
            <li> Difficult to find at retail because it is overshadowed by later products such as Mach 4.  </li>
            <li> I have been ordering Gillette Sensor 3 blades in 8-cartridge packs for the last few years through Amazon, as they are difficult to get locally (Washington DC Metro area).  </li>
            <li> I let my little bro try it</li>
            <li> However, I expect it is little cheaper</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on Sensor3.</li>
            <li> Did not fit handle we had.  </li>
            <li> but I still use a blade for the few whiskers the electric misses under my chin.</li>
            <li> Not real good for heavy course areas.</li>
            <li> Too bad Gillette has to market heavily to keep adding gimmicks and new razor blade lines to sell other blades at highter prices.  </li>
            <li> Like another reviewer, I have sensitive skin and a dark, wiry beard, which is a bad combination if you want a close shave without turning your face into hamburger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately Gillette has cut back production of the Sensor3 cartridge in favor of a fully disposable version and the Mach 3 Turbo/Fusion line.  </li>
            <li> It is usually duller than the rest, but I recognize this &amp;#34;Mystery of Manufacture&amp;#34; and use it accordingly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the one blade, two blade, three blade, and ten blade (exaggerated) etc etc...</li>
            <li> I get with these blades, but it has been difficult to find in my local stores.</li>
            <li> There has never been a problem in the past.  </li>
            <li> These are now hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> The blades seemed dull</li>
            <li> Also, the blades seem to dull faster than the Sensor.  </li>
            <li> He is supplied for the balance of the year, at least.  </li>
            <li> I have the worst possible combination for shaving: a thick beard and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for at least 10 years.</li>
            <li> Maybe by your late 20s, you can go to three blade.</li>
            <li> The mach 3 lies flat on your face and is awkward to shave with.  </li>
            <li> Simply because I like it!&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, blades are too expensive!</li>
            <li> some people are praising the conventional razor style (not all weird like the mach 3/m3 power/gillette fusion design).  </li>
            <li> Not sure what the rest of the reviewers are talking about the fake blades and all that junk.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even feel the razor cutting anything as I pulled it down along my face and neck.</li>
            <li> Very hard to find at the store.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m confused.  </li>
            <li> is a secret: if you need four blades, just stroke with the two blade twice!&lt;br /&gt;Regardless,</li>
            <li> Razors are a ripoff, and it&#x27;s even worse when you can&#x27;t find what you want because Gillette doesn&#x27;t make them anymore</li>
            <li> you know the Men&#x27;s razor game pricing is simply ridiculous!</li>
            <li> it is very unfortunate sensor3 is so darn hard to find.</li>
            <li> These blades are too expensive in any store.</li>
            <li> All razor blades have become noticeably expensive in the retail stores but the internet has come to the rescue.</li>

            <li> There is something seriously wrong with this batch.  </li>
            <li> Why are these razors so damn difficult to find?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> mean they go bad a bit faster.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just disappointed that the product is so difficult to locate in retail stores.</li>
            <li> The problem with disposable blades is they are too expensive!</li>
            <li> In addition, the added width of the blades made it nearly impossible to shave the areas underneath my nostrils.</li>
            <li> When that got too painful</li>
            <li> however, i was disappointed by this..  </li>
            <li> so it might have exacerbated the problem, or maybe my skin has to get used to a razor, but nonetheless i was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used these for years and have never been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> the worst problem was the microcuts!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Thank you for having just what I needed for my husband&#x27;s shaving requirements.  He can&#x27;t use just any blades and I was not having any luck finding them in about 4 different stores in town.  He is supplied for the balance of the year, at least.  Again, thank you.</li>
            <li> These razors are easily the best Gillette razors on the market.  They are much more precise than the 5 and six blade models and cut through thicker beards like mine much more easily than the two blade sensor excel blades.  If you are only marginally happy with the other Gillette blades I highly recommend trying these out.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  You get way more blade for your buck.  These blades are too expensive in any store.</li>
            <li> I have the worst possible combination for shaving: a thick beard and sensitive skin. Ingrown hairs and razor bumps were a weekly, if not daily occurance for me. I started off as a teenager with the original Sensor. When that got too painful I transitioned to the Sensor Excel. That served me well through my college years, where I could get away with shaving every 2 or 3 days. I found that my face needed a day or 2 off before I could shave comfortably again. When I entered the workforce, the president of my company noticed the stubble on my face during my \\&quot;off\\&quot; days and insisted that I shave every day. Well, after about a week of daily use with the Excel, my neck was about as raw and sore as it ever had been. That was about the time that Gillette introduced the Mach3. I transitioned to that, and eventually the Mach3 Turbo, but I was STILL getting ingrown hairs and razor bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did some research and found that my technique (shaving against \\&quot;the grain\\&quot; without shaving with the grain first) was causing a great deal of my problems, so I started to change my ways with less than stellar results. The Mach3 was designed to be used \\&quot;against the grain\\&quot;, and shaving in the direction of my hair growth produced almost no results at all. I couldn&#x27;t even feel the razor cutting anything as I pulled it down along my face and neck. In addition, the added width of the blades made it nearly impossible to shave the areas underneath my nostrils. I had to keep my old Sensor handy to tackle that area when I was done with the rest of my face. My fiancee suggested spending $20 on the new battery-powered Mach3...no, thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I saw the Senor3, and decided to give it a try. The blades were cheaper than the Mach3 (even at Costco Warehouse prices), so it wasn&#x27;t much of an investment for the experiment. All I have to say is, \\&quot;THANK GOODNESS!\\&quot; The Sensor3 has the best of both worlds between the Excel and the Mach3. The blades fit any Sensor handle, which is a more traditional feel than the initially-awkward feel of the Mach3, so I didn&#x27;t have to invest in a whole new system. It has 3 blades instead of 2, so it&#x27;s more comfortable that the 2-blade Senors AND I can get to the area under my nose. But the best part is I can shave WITH the grain and get a very acceptable, although not perfect, results. To the outside world I look clean-shaven every day, even though I can feel a tiny bit of stubble. That&#x27;s a fair trade-off for not being in pain all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now shave daily with hardly any irritation, and on special occassions when I need my shave to be extra close, I re-lather after the first go around, shave lightly against the grain, and I&#x27;m as smooth as a baby&#x27;s backside. I&#x27;ve also invested in a few other items that have added to my comfort. The \\&quot;Art of Shaving\\&quot; products are a godsend. Invest in the Pre-Shave oil, trust me. I also went \\&quot;retro\\&quot; and picked up their shaving cream and brush. Guys, your woman will DEFINITELY think it&#x27;s sexy when she sees you lathering up if you go that route. I think I FINALLY found something that works for me after 15 years of shaving!traditional feel than the initially-awkward feel of the Mach3, so I didn&#x27;t have to invest in a whole new system.

That&#x27;s a fair trade-off for not being in pain all the time.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I now shave daily with hardly any irritation, and on special occassions when I need my shave to be extra close, I re-lather after the first go around, shave lightly against the grain, and I&#x27;m as smooth as a baby&#x27;s backside. I&#x27;ve also invested in a few other items that have added to my comfort. The \\&quot;Art of Shaving\\&quot; products are a godsend. Invest in the Pre-Shave oil, trust me. I also went \\&quot;retro\\&quot; and picked up their shaving cream and brush. Guys, your woman will DEFINITELY think it&#x27;s sexy when she sees you lathering up if you go that route. I think I FINALLY found something that works for me after 15 years of shaving!</li>
            <li> All razor blades have become noticeably expensive in the retail stores but the internet has come to the rescue. The only way to match the web price would be to purchase razors in bulk from a \\&quot;club\\&quot; type store. Even the shipping was reasonably fast and free.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite blade but it is discontinued in favor of the Mach3 (which is like shaving with a boat paddle).  The mach 3 lies flat on your face and is awkward to shave with.  I wish Gillette brings back the excel 3.</li>
            <li> I looked all over for this product and finally found it here at Amazon. My husband is super picky and won&#x27;t use any other razor than the one he has. I will be buying these replacement cartrages here now. I got fast service and the item arived in perfect condision. Thank you Amazon.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the rest of the reviewers are talking about the fake blades and all that junk. These blades work just as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Mach before and by mistake I bought the Sensor3 and the skin was not adjusted initially, I had minor cuts on the neck where the skin is thinner. But very soon it all worked out fine, I get a perfect shave just as I did with Mach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re using Sensor now, I&#x27;d bet that these blades will make you happy.</li>
            <li> After using this razor for a short period of time, I feel compelled to tell others how it stacks up in the world of razors. With Gillette offering several varieties of the Mach 3, the Sensor3 system has been slowly ported over from a cartridge-based system to a disposable one. The cartridges are still available in some stores, however. This review specifically covers the Sensor3 cartridge system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aesthetics: 4 stars. I like the design of the Sensor3. It&#x27;s a very clean, understated design that feels good in the hand and offers good maneuverability when shaving. The Sensor3 cartridges are noticeably smaller than the Mach 3 cartridges, by comparison. The cartridge also sits at a much more pronounced angle than the Mach 3. This overall design allows for more precision shaving--areas below the nose and around the sideburns are relatively easy to cut as a result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave: 3 stars. I was surprised at the amount of resistance I encountered when shaving. I found there to be a great deal of drag with only a couple of days&#x27; facial hair growth. The angle of the blade takes some getting used to. I noticed several times that I placed the blade on my face at the wrong angle, presumably because of my adjustment to the Mach 3/Fusion/Quattro razors which seem to have a more linear handle design. The biggest problem I encountered were several cuts. Lubrication is minimal, and one wonders if there really is something to the design of the Mach 3/Fusion razors. I do note that the shave was close, but comfort was lacking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Durability: 3 stars. This is the durability rating I give to the Sensor3 disposables. I did not test these cartridges for durability, as I quickly realized that the Sensor3 disposable blade is identical to the Sensor3 cartridges. Blades will last a week at most, perhaps three to four shaves at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: The Sensor3 would make a fine choice as a disposable option (and a better choice than the Mach 3 disposable). For razor systems, one would be advised to choose the Mach 3 Turbo for overall comfort. Or, if you are particularly interested in the Sensor family of razors, choose the SensorExcel. There is no particular benefit to the third blade in the Sensor family.o choose the Mach 3 Turbo for overall comfort. Or, if you are particularly interested in the Sensor family of razors, choose the SensorExcel. There is no particular benefit to the third blade in the Sensor family.</li>
            <li> Can only find double edge in stores.  But the triple edge is so much better.  I also like these much better than the disposable triple blades.</li>
            <li> This 3 bladed cartridge is good but I haven&#x27;t been useing it for very long.I still like the 2 bladed cartridge.If I can get a good price I will keep buying the Sensor3 cartridges.</li>
            <li> Gillette Sensor3 System is the best razor my husband and I have found.  For years I used razors for \\&quot;women.\\&quot;  Now my husband and I are using the same razors.  I have looked everywheree for the 3-bladed replacement cartridges(pack of 8 cartridges).  Amazon is the only place I have found them.  You can easily find the 2-bladed cartridges, but we like the 3-bladed ones better.  When we purchased the razor it came with one 3-bladed cartridge and the rest were 2-bladed.  Searching drug stores, online, etc., I have found them only at Amazon.  I plan to purchase more and I have given a razor and ordered some 3-bladed cartridges for my father-in-law. I would recommend this product to everyone.  Whenever someone tells me they can&#x27;t find something they are looking for, I tell them to go to amazon.com, because we have found and ordered many different products from this company.  I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I use these and couldn&#x27;t be happier. These blades provided the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. I&#x27;ll never use a &#x27;woman&#x27;s razor&#x27; again.</li>
            <li> If you are a guy...you know the Men&#x27;s razor game pricing is simply ridiculous! Half the time...i can&#x27;t even find these blades in stock. Well this has solved 3 problems in one! Price ...convenience ...and automatically ship every 3 months. Win win win situation...highly suggested</li>
            <li> Still using these blades, easy on the face and very close shave.</li>
            <li> I wish I could find a better way to shave. I have tried every razor, every brand...even disposables. But, Sensor 3 is the best for me.&lt;br /&gt;I shave every day, except for the days I don&#x27;t mind looking like a bum, and I get a good shave for a week on one blade.&lt;br /&gt;The newer razors cost more and cannot reach up under my nose. (Am I the only one who noticed that?)&lt;br /&gt;So, why isn&#x27;t this blade available at my local Wal-mart?</li>
            <li> The Gillette Sensor3 cartridges strike a great balance between the three blade cutting power of the popular Mach 3 razors and the deft handling of the Sensor Excel.  As a result I could shave down my beard in fewer passes than with a 2-blade Sensor Excel, AND trim my sideburns and below my nose more cleanly than with a Mach 3.  Good compromise.  Unfortunately Gillette has cut back production of the Sensor3 cartridge in favor of a fully disposable version and the Mach 3 Turbo/Fusion line.  Get these while you can.</li>
            <li> The blades are just what you would buy in the store but at a good price. The are just as sharp and last as long as the ones purchased locally.</li>
            <li> These blades are very sharp and they give me such a close shave I can go 2 or 3 days between shaves.  I recommend them to anybody who has the right handle.</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer, I have sensitive skin and a dark, wiry beard, which is a bad combination if you want a close shave without turning your face into hamburger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using Sensor Excel and decided to try the Sensor3 based on other reviews. The Sensor3 gives me a closer shave than Excel, though not as close as I had hoped. But there was a definite improvement in comfort. My face is noticeably less irritated with the Sensor3. This comfort factor alone is, to me, worth the additional cost over the Excel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, our faces are all different, and \\&quot;your results may vary.\\&quot; But I would recommend buying a pack of Sensor3 and trying them out, you may be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> The blades are predictably reliable, especially the fourth of each rack.  It is usually duller than the rest, but I recognize this &amp;#34;Mystery of Manufacture&amp;#34; and use it accordingly.  [It&#x27;s the same with Arm &amp; Hammer toothpaste; there&#x27;s always an &amp;#34;air bubble&amp;#34; in the first three-quarters inch of each tube that I can rely upon to feel cheated.]</li>
            <li> Well, there&#x27;s not much to tell. The cartridges came very fast, they are quite OK, and I am using them for shaving.</li>
            <li> The blades work fine, but the price is just irrational. The cost of these razors inspired me to switch to a double-edge safety razor, and I&#x27;ll never look back.</li>
            <li> Ordered the wrong blades. (my fault). So I bought a sensor razor for the blades. Now we find out all of the senor razors are disposables. Guess this is what I get for not reading product description a little better!</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive skin, after trying every major brand these new Sensor Blades finally give me what I want: a close shave with minimal irritation. These new Sensor blades use the more traditional handle design with quality blades you expect from Gillette. I&#x27;m getting a good, close shave with very little irritation. And you know what I use the same blade twice.</li>
            <li> After trying every major brand of electric razors, the Mach 3 turbo, and the Schick Quattro, these new Sensor Blades finally give me what I want:  a close shave with minimal irritation.  I was never a fan of the Mach 3 design because I could never find the right angle to shave with the odd handle/blade design.  These new Sensor blades use the more traditional handle design with a the quality blades you expect from Gillette.  I&#x27;m getting a good, close shave with very little irritation and ingrowns.&lt;br /&gt;I also use King of Shaves gel.  After spending years trying to find the right combitnation of blades and creams, I think I&#x27;ve found what works for me.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, these blades are cheaper than the Mach 3 line.</li>
            <li> This razor is more accurate, cuts closer and is less irritating than the Mach 3.  FINALLY, the original super accurate sensor comes with three blades!  I let my little bro try it and he threw out his Mach 3 as did I. BOOYYAAACCAAASHEE.</li>
            <li> I am fine with the 2 blade sensor but the 3 blade doesn&#x27;t seem to shave as well, I have to go over spots frequently.  Worse yet, it seems much more difficult to reach under my nose.  Will go back to the 2 blade sensor cartridges when the are gone (if not before)</li>
            <li> Difficult to find in stores for some reason. Found on Amazon. Works as expected. Received within 5 days. Exactly as ordered.</li>
            <li> Cheapest place I have found these razor blades.  Very hard to find at the store.  Cheaper with subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> The 2 bladed Sensor is more accurate around nose and sideburns and I can&#x27;t tell the difference in the closeness of the shave. Don&#x27;t waste your money on Sensor3.</li>
            <li> I want you to go to your bathroom and pick up that mideival looking 17 blade electric vibrating razor that you are using and throw it as far in the woods as you can.  All those gimmicky razors flat out suck.  This sensor excel line of razors shaves my dark facial hair closer than anything I have ever used ever, and I don&#x27;t even feel it.  It feels like I&#x27;m standing in the shower just wiping the shaving cream off my face.  Forget your 27 blade tool and get this...my girlfriend uses it more than I do and it&#x27;s still sharp as a comedian after a couple of months.  Stop wasting your money on crappy gimmicks with batteries and get the real deal.</li>
            <li> it is very unfortunate sensor3 is so darn hard to find. amazon.com appears to have the best price so far - shipping free plus no tax is a big plus. nothing gillette or anyone else has made does a better job. close shave, gets hard to reach areas and able to use multiple times. works well with shaving gels to get that baby face feel every time.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been shaving with a rotary electric for a long time, but decided to try razor shaving for more closeness and less irritation (the two things all us guys want!)  however, i was disappointed by this..  first off i felt \\&quot;pulling\\&quot; on my cheek.  it was only about 2 days&#x27; growth.  i thought \\&quot;the blades should be sharper than this.\\&quot;  it was probably 8 years ago i first shaved with a twin-blade gillette, but it seemed every bit as technically advanced as this (minus one blade), shaved fast and i got NO irritation.  huh?  how has their technology actually gone backwards??  pulling isn&#x27;t the only problem though.  the worst problem was the microcuts!  i got cut on both sides of my neck and one part of my cheek.  luckily my other cheek, chin and under nose were spared.  i do have very sensitive skin, and i already had some razor burn there so it might have exacerbated the problem, or maybe my skin has to get used to a razor, but nonetheless i was disappointed.  the shave was close, but hey, that&#x27;s what i expect from any razor.  the lubricating strip is useless IMHO because you have to hold it a certain way for it to contact.  besides, isn&#x27;t using a good soothing shaving gel more important?  so i have to rate this as a 3 stars, average razor.  i&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s perfectly good for most people, but for a guy like me with sensitive skin it didn&#x27;t work as well as i hoped.  some people are praising the conventional razor style (not all weird like the mach 3/m3 power/gillette fusion design).  ok, fine, but how is it i got a better shave with that really old gillette razor i&#x27;m sure they don&#x27;t even make anymore?  i&#x27;m confused.  and now i&#x27;m curious what kind of performance i would get with a mach 3......</li>
            <li> Subject line pretty much says it all. I highly recommend the Sensor 3 razor.</li>
            <li> I had the old gilette handle which took these blades.  Got them when Amazon offered a good deal combined with the coupon.</li>
            <li> I had bought these Sensor3 cartridges before from anoher seller and the packaging was awful, but the packaging from THIS seller was great!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent razor and I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else on my sensitive skin.  I&#x27;m just disappointed that the product is so difficult to locate in retail stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both the Sensor 2 blade and Fusion 5 blade, and these Sensor 3 blades are a good deal for the price. It&#x27;s a much better shave than the 2 blade, and less expensive the Fusion 5 blade. It&#x27;s hard to find the 3 blades, so it&#x27;s great finding it on Amazon. If you want to test it out, try buying a disposable version of the Sensor 3 blade.</li>
            <li> I tried using many other blades/Cartridges, but I was facing many cuts during shaving. Now these Sensor Cartridges proved to be taking care of my face. With one shave drive makes face clean.I tried with reverse shaving and blades were still in good condition.</li>
            <li> I always used sensor 2 due to agility of 2 blades, but decided to try these and glad I did, do a much better job without any cuts and last a long time.</li>
            <li> Its work pretty good, but Mach3 works better, stay sharp longer.&lt;br /&gt;Already try all the 4/5 blade type on the market as well, power or not, nothing come close to the Mach3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 20130520:&lt;br /&gt;After long term testing/usage against the Mach3, Mach3 perform so much better and last lots longer too.&lt;br /&gt;Drop from 3 to 2 stars.</li>
            <li> I used these cartridges as replacement blades for my headblade (to shave my head) for the first time yesterday.  I could not believe the results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-closer shave than I&#x27;ve had from any electric or from Headblade double or triple and definately better than the Gillette Mach 3 and Mach 3 turbo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-MUCH LESS IRRITATION than with any of the above products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave was smooth and easy and zero cuts and nicks.  I used Headblade Headslick shaving cream and shaved in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I may throw away my panasonic electric razor(it&#x27;s a great razor) and just use the HB with the sensor3 on everything from the shoulders up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Gillette!  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I am using the first blade. It works well I think. However, I expect it is little cheaper</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used these for years and have never been disappointed.  They provide a smooth shave with very few nicks.  We hope they&#x27;ll keep making these, because the 3 blade option is best for us for optimal performance and flexibility; th quads are just too much of a good thing!</li>
            <li> They were great my husband loves them the best of all the razors. They are getting more and more expensive as time goes by like everything else..</li>
            <li> These are Gillettes best effort with the small head and 3 blades and they are hard to find any more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the one blade, two blade, three blade, and ten blade (exaggerated) etc etc... but for my face, I get the closest shave a caveman can get using this three bladed razor.  Been using this type for about 10-15yrs now.  Everyone is different, but this is the best for my face.  Most of the latest men&#x27;s razors have about 5 blades or so, and twist and turn, bend, and all sorts...  basically made for women- curves but marketed for men.  A straight sturdy razor blade like this is all a man needs if you want it smooth.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is my face, but I find that this razor doesn&#x27;t work as good as the cheaper Gillette sensor. It seems to be the angle. This razor takes up a larger area than the sensor, so it doesn&#x27;t reach into areas like clefts or turns (chin area, jaw line) as well. It works better on a flat area, like legs for example. My fiancee uses it for shaving her legs and likes it better, but I don&#x27;t care for it.</li>
            <li> VERY DISAPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT. CAN NOT GET  A CLOSE SHAVE WITH IT, MUST GO OVER SAME AREA SEVERAL TIMES CAUSING RAZOR BURN. WON&#x27;T RE-PURCHASE.</li>
            <li> The cartridge is nice and slim ...not as slim as the twin blade, but I can still easily get in the space between my lip and nose which I have trouble doing with the 4 and 5 blade systems and I do not like the cartridges with the single blade.  Sensor 3 gives me a nice comfortable shave (I use with Nivia Shave Gel for sensitive skin).  Even compared to the Mach 3 series for me, the Sensor 3 works better and I do not get any nicks or cuts as I have on rare occasions from the Mach 3.</li>
            <li> Whatto say about razor blades? They arrived before the expected date, they were sharp, they fit, matter of fact, they are exactly what I could buy in the store(when I can find it) for about the same price.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this razor &amp; its blades.  They&#x27;re long-lasting - and getting more difficult to find in regular stores, so we were delighted to find that they could be purchased on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Really enjoy the feeling and smooth shave I get with these blades, but it has been difficult to find in my local stores. Buying on-line is so much easier than checking the store shelves each week.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using these razors for a long time because these seem to be the only ones that don&#x27;t leave him all bloodied up.</li>
            <li> I get three shaves from each blade. The results are smooth and comfortable. Having the blades shipped to me automatically on a regular basis is very convenient.</li>
            <li> Perfect and in time! Makes it so convenient to not have to worry about running out razors. Plus it&#x27;s cheaper than getting them elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Precise, smooth and feels great.  I like it better than the 4 blade design due to the compact size.  I just feel like it glides faster even though the blade coverage is less than the 4 blade design.  I&#x27;ve been using it for at least 10 years.</li>
            <li> The best blades I have used in over 35 years of daily shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Too bad Gillette has to market heavily to keep adding gimmicks and new razor blade lines to sell other blades at highter prices.  These are now hard to find in stores. The best price I found was on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Company makes many terrific products, but their marketing department can&#x27;t just accept that and keep making good products with small improvements. They have to keep trying to top themselves with new products of dubious value. Pretty soon their shaving cartridges will have 20 blades and be as large as tennis rackets. Their Sensor3 blades work fine, so of course they&#x27;re becoming scarce. The racks in stores are filled with their new, more expensive products that don&#x27;t really work that much better.</li>
            <li> My husband refuses to change razors and you can not find these blades in the stores anymore, so he is very happy that I found these and have a subscription to receive a new package every two months. Blades are so expensive now that it&#x27;s nice to get a discount and a regular shipment.</li>
            <li> Have been using these blades for quite a while. Theres nothing to dislike about them. They give a good shave and are cheaper than the Mach or Profusion.</li>
            <li> Maybe I am just to frugal to buy the latest and greatest razor handle.  I have been using this 3 blade cartridge for a number of years.  I resist the additional cost of newer models.</li>
            <li> Each time we look for these blades, they are in a locked cabinet and we need to find an attendant to open the cabinet so we can purchase it.  Ordering this on-line took the pain out of buying this item.</li>
            <li> I used to rely on Sensor Excel until got a sample of this blade included in an Excel pack. In Sensor 3, the extra blade does not add bulk but improves shave quality and has longer life. Finally, very good value.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More recent Gillette cartridges IMO have too many blades, which, for my face, makes it very difficult to reach under the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would estimate my facial hair density as medium - well, maybe a 6-7 on the scal of 10.</li>
            <li> very good stuff with a reasonable price. I am glad that the bid was placed.</li>
            <li> As a man who shaves his head, I&#x27;ve really come to rely on these blades, but dang they are expensive in the store. What a great buy. Love Amazon.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on these blades !!  Only good for two to three shaves and they drag on your skin.  This is a not a knock on Gillette but they are made in \\&quot;BRAZIL ?\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Been using these blades for years, nothing better!</li>
            <li> Really! No need for a third blade but I tried it. They work nicely. Not real good for heavy course areas. Must apply  a lot of pressure to remove that type of beard. The razors today simply do not shave close enough, really. I think the manufactures made cartridges years ago that really gave a close shave but must stopped because of, who knows, complaints of nicks???</li>
            <li> The problem with disposable blades is they are too expensive! This is a decent price but, fundamentally, overpriced even at a discount.&lt;br /&gt;Picking the right blade or, nowadays, blades in a disposable, really depends on your face.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend Sensor because the handle works with both the two blade version and the three blade version. Most young men ONLY NEED two blades! Maybe by your late 20s, you can go to three blade. I can’t fit the four blade types around my nose for detail work. If you have big nostrils, maybe you can…&lt;br /&gt;Here is a secret: if you need four blades, just stroke with the two blade twice!&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, the secret to making blades last a long time is to DRY THEM when you are done. I make sure it is rinsed of hair and foam, then I shake it, tap it on my towel, then wipe the whole thing. Instead of a blade corroding in say two weeks, you might get four or more weeks. But it also depends on the time of year. Dryer winter means blades last longer. Humid summers (or locations) mean they go bad a bit faster.&lt;br /&gt;Also, try different shave foams. I shaved with a brush using cream from a tube or jar as well as soap in a mug for many years. It does give the best shave but, you need to see which is best for you - cream, tube, or mug.  Get the best pure badger hair brush you can, they last a lifetime! I have one I bought for well over $20 in the mid 1980s. That would be about $40+ today but I still have it and it still is the best brush. It is nothing fancy handle wise. So no fancy handle to jack up the price.&lt;br /&gt;In winter, I use foam in a can that is heated. Simply because I like it!&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, blades are too expensive!</li>
            <li> I have had the original Sensor for almost 12 years now, and it still works the best of the ones i have tried. The Sensor 3 blades nick me up more, the Mach 3 again tends to nick me up more as well, and any of the store brand replacement heads for this Sensor just do not work out as well as the original sensor/sensor XL heads. Its great to see Gillette has done what store brands have done long ago, add the 3 blade and it does work better than the others, but the two blades seem to give me the closest shave without irritation, and after 12 years that alot of shaving. Don&#x27;t waste money on more expensive newer models, if you have this one or can get this one, blades are cheaper and it does better, Gillette sensor blades last longer.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  And Amazon delivered at an inexpensive price with free shipping...Can&#x27;t say much more...</li>
            <li> These are the only blades my husband will use.</li>
            <li> I really like them. However, their edges don&#x27;t seem to last very well. I have to struggle to get 30 days of use out of each blade.</li>
            <li> By far the best blades I have used. Closer and more comfortable than the Sensor Excel, and these last longer as well.</li>
            <li> this is the product my husband has used for years and we can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.  He is very happy that we can still get it here.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Good blades that are hard to find in stores anymore.  Work well and provide a clean shave</li>
            <li> Stays in place, tracks well. Open back facilitates flushing, heavier end caps make great stability. Lasts as long as any I have used. No complaints.</li>
            <li> These work as expected.  I bought them before and bought this time for the price.  I got exactly as I expected.  Sometimes you get exactly what should get,  GOOD QUALITY at a fair price!!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the 5 star ratings are about.  I tried this turkey several years ago and it just didn&#x27;t give me a close shave. I shaved for almost 1/2 hour, pulling my skin this way and that and trying different angles with the razor and one fact remains: THE BLADES DON&#x27;T GET CLOSE ENOUGH TO THE SKIN, PERIOD! In my opinion, the best shaving system ever, was the original Gillette Sensor. The razor handle angle is perfect and the blades gave me a close shave. Yes, it did give me an occasional nik, but that&#x27;s because the blades actually get close enough to the skin to cut the hair - plain and simple, no technical jargon required. It seems that the various shaving system companies decided to appeal only to the more \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; men out there who might faint at the sight of a little bit of blood caused by an occasional nik. One company actually sent me a four blade system. It appeared a good idea except for one little problem. Like the Sensor Excel and the Sensor 3, they give you a comfortable shave but not a close shave by any stretch because THEY DON&#x27;T GET CLOSE ENOUGH TO THE SKIN! The razors really glide on your face but don&#x27;t cut much. Another company sent me a sample of a shaving system which actually uses the word \\&quot;Turbo\\&quot;. That alone should be warning enough - just like when they add the word \\&quot;Euro\\&quot; to the name of a product.  Same problem:  doesn&#x27;t shave close enough.&lt;br /&gt;I strongly believe that they added the third and fourth blade in the systems only to justify charging 20% or more for a additional piece of metal that costs them a fraction of a penny.&lt;br /&gt;Good news though! For those men out there who are not of the \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; persuasion, you can buy the Gillette Excel (or the Sensor 3 - I believe they also fit the original Sensor handle), throw out the useless blades and buy the CVS Flexx blades that fit the Gillette handle (at abouth half the price). They actually perform the same as the eccellent extinct Sensor blades and I actually get a few more shaves. In the NY-NJ area, the supermarket chain, Shoprite, sells equivalent blades under their own brand name that work the same as the CVS Flexx and are actually cheaper still.  Also, when I forgot my razor in a vacation resort, I was forced to use my wife&#x27;s Gillette Venus razor and found it to work unexpectedly well.  So that&#x27;s another option, although you may have to take out a second morgage to buy those blades.NY-NJ area, the supermarket chain, Shoprite, sells equivalent blades under their own brand name that work the same as the CVS Flexx and are actually cheaper still.

            <li> so much better with three blades than two.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. Fast shipping and perfect fit for my razor</li>
            <li> Razors are a ripoff, and it&#x27;s even worse when you can&#x27;t find what you want because Gillette doesn&#x27;t make them anymore [or short ships them or something now that they have the Mach6 x 10 to the power of N-squared turbo boost toaster model].  I don&#x27;t need 18 blades, just want to shave my damned face!  Sensor 3 is a happy medium and these were reasonable.</li>
            <li> Despite Gillette&#x27;s constant efforts to make you buy the new (and more expensive) Mach 3 (going so far as putting leaflets in the Sensor Excel, telling you to switch the Mach 3), stick with this old standby.  It is by far the best cartridge system on the market.  The slim head is much more manageable than the oversized wall of blades of the Mach 3 (which feels like you are just wiping your face with blades, instead of using a razor).  That little area under your nose is reason enough to avoid the Mach 3. Tell Gillette to quit pushing its Mach 3, and to make the Sensor 3 more widely available (though you can still find it at Amazon).</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0001LQGEM Gillette Sensor3 System Replacement Cartridges, Pack of 8 Cartridges]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replacement Cartridges had a different head than original.  Did not fit handle we had.  Not the best buy I ever made.</li>
            <li> Good product that performs as promised.  Difficult to find at retail because it is overshadowed by later products such as Mach 4.  Easy to find at Amazon and the price is right.</li>
            <li> The blades seemed dull</li>
            <li> At the price what more could I ask and they came in a timely manner, thanks so much:)</li>
            <li> After getting used to the two blade version, using these are a big step down in my opinion.  Works fine over wide flat spaces, so I am thinking if you were shaving your legs, would be great.  But, I don&#x27;t and trying to shave around tight spots like upper lip and chin, these feel very clumsy and leave too many spots unshaven for me.  I actually touch up with the Norelco rather than trying to finish with these.  I won&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
            <li> These do a good job, but why are razor blades so expensive - wherever you buy them? I finally bought an electric razor (Panasonic ES8249 from Amazon. It gets ***** five stars), but I still use a blade for the few whiskers the electric misses under my chin.</li>
            <li> Best refill for Sensor Razors. Period. Much better than the two blade Sensor refills. Better, closer shave.</li>
            <li> Stumbled on the three bladed cartridges when replacing the handle and since I do not shave but every four or five days, this cartridge cuts right through for a good three and sometimes four shaves unlike the Sensor 2. Could not find replacement Sensor 3 cartridges locally, only if purchasing the entire unit with handle.</li>
            <li> Forget these &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; razors, I get the best shave from this blade than any other. Better control closer shave and all around better performance.</li>
            <li> There is something seriously wrong with this batch.  I have been ordering Gillette Sensor 3 blades in 8-cartridge packs for the last few years through Amazon, as they are difficult to get locally (Washington DC Metro area).  There has never been a problem in the past.  With this order of 5 packs, I have had to discard each of 4 new blades from the first pack after just one or two strokes!  They are so rough that they would have taken half my face off: the last time I encountered blades of such roughness was in Cambodia.  The blades are still Made in Brazil and nothing visible seems to have changed, but I am seeking recourse/refund/return through Amazon and Gillette.  Be advised accordingly.</li>
            <li> Gives a closer shave than the Sensor two blade but takes longer.  The chartridge hugs your face with more friction, so a close shave takes more effort.  If you rush your strokes the Sensor 3 will cause irritation.  Also, the blades seem to dull faster than the Sensor.  For the price, the design is pretty good but not great.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. these 3 blade inserst are not available locally and it was good to get them off line. Good shipment as they arrived before schedule.</li>
            <li> Slightly better than a rusty nail. Maybe I should update my tetanus shot. Give me the address and I&#x27;ll send it back.</li>
            <li> I continue to use these older style of cartridge because they are well made, hold their edge for a good week of shaves and give a clean shave without razor burn.</li>
            <li> Can&amp;#34;t find these in the store anymore and the throw away ones are junk.  If you are looing for the real deal in a hurry..this is it</li>
            <li> Why are these razors so damn difficult to find?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are my favorite when I can find them. Three blades moving in the right direction with an aloe vera strip for smoothness.</li>
            <li> The company slogan is: the best a man can get.  As far as I&#x27;m concerned, this is the best product in their whole line. After three blades, it becomes hyperbole, but the sensor 3 does indeed show a noticeable improvement over the also-OK Sensor Excel.  I&#x27;m about thirty years into my shaving life, maybe another thirty to go. the only thing that would ever induce me to change is if they stop making these, which I mistakenly thought they had done. Great surprise to find them on Amazon, since some of the discount brick &amp; mortar shops don&#x27;t bother to stock them.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than at CVS.  The product is great and works well with my shaver.  I can&#x27;t live without it...any more words left?</li>
            <li> These razors have the skinniest head of any 3 bladed razors on the market so they fit around the mustache area better than anything else I can find.</li>
            <li> Love these razors, just wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive. An 8 count usually last 6 months with shaving every other day.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted as they are available locally.  Grocery stores, drug stores and variety stores are not carrying them at all.</li>
