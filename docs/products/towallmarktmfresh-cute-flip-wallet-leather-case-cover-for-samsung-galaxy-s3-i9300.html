            <li> It is a very pretty case. The magnet works really well, which was nice. You can fit a lot of cards in the two spaces provided. It&#x27;s easy to get your phone out of the case when necessary. The metal bow fell off after about a month, though, and the flap (which is held together with some sort of adhesive) fell apart after about a month, too. It&#x27;s very pretty, but is not long-lasting if you use it everyday.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute and I like the quality</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t the right case for my phone</li>

            <li> This is a  really cute phone case. I always get compliments on it. However, I&#x27;ve had it for a month now, and the back part of it is slowly peeling off. Also, if you drop this at a short distance, your phone will be okay but it will fall out of the case and give you a slight scare. You get what you pay for so don&#x27;t expect top quality. It&#x27;s good for the price though. One thing I wish it came with was a wristlet string, but I just used an old one.</li>
            <li> I loved it! The magnet did work as someone previously stated it did not.</li>
            <li> Brought this for my cousin, she&#x27;s loves it . Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love  this case it&#x27;s very trendy and cute! It keeps phone covered since I have little ones. However, I do notice the phone slips out of the case if it falls other than that it&#x27;s a plus!</li>
            <li> Beautiful case, great quality!</li>
            <li> I JUST BOUGHT FOR THE COLOR</li>
            <li> I had bought this before and let me tell you it sucks. The case is nice but quality is very bad. The plastic cover started to break and fell apart. The leather ripped apart. The walet doesn&#x27;t hold anything,everything you put in the wallet slides right out but it&#x27;s nice if you want to use it once in a while.</li>
            <li> Cuteâ™¡ Came faster then it said (:</li>
            <li> Came on time, but the top of it start to peel off already.</li>
            <li> Beautiful to nice color preciously I love</li>
