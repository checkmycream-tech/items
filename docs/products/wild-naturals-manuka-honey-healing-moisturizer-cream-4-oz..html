            <li>and it helps smooth it out</li>

            <li>It sinks right in,leaves that matte finish all the users report about, doesn&#x27;t give you any greasy feelings and is just very light, feels good on the skin.</li>
            <li>It went on smoothly and does calm the skin.</li>
            <li>I recently have problems with urticaria and this helps to relief the burning and itching plus is not grease and smells good.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a fabulous product!</li>
            <li>It calms itchy areas and provides adequate moisture.</li>
            <li>Love this moisturizer, non greasy, light natural smell.</li>
            <li>So i&#x27;m pretty sure it is just as good as that other one.</li>
            <li>Very good, just too small.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I tend to break out in rashes when I use the smell good moisturizers from my department stores, and my skin starts to get rather dry as the seasons change into autumn.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve seen an amazing reduction in my overall redness.  </li>
            <li>I have tried literally hundreds of skincare products in an effort to find a moisturizer that wouldn&#x27;t upset my already irritated skin without any success.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why i purchased basically the identical cream from this seller right away.</li>
            <li>This has stopped a flare right in its tracks.</li>
            <li>It is very light but effective cream, I find a tiny layer does go a long way!</li>
            <li>Maybe I need a higher concentration of honey.</li>
            <li>The first night I put it on and went to bed.</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more when needed.</li>
            <li>so i&#x27;m well aware of its wholesome effect on our health.</li>
            <li>Anyways i&#x27;ve ordered the cream based on Manuka honey from another seller and have been extremely satisfied with it for that short period of time that i was taking it.</li>
            <li>Works far better super expensive prescription ointments and keeps my face moisturized and happy.</li>
            <li>Whatever positive reviews you can read about this product are well grounded.</li>
            <li>Manuka honey has healed many of the strange irritations/rashes on my skin immediately.  </li>
            <li>It really does work.</li>
            <li>very healing.  </li>
            <li>I really like this moisturizer and noticed it helped my rosacea.</li>
            <li>I was informed that the jars for all of them are even filled at the same place.</li>
            <li>No smell, really.</li>
            <li>&amp; I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>, it is not oily and it is very soothing with his psoriasis..</li>
            <li>I just used this to make my skin softer and heal any injuries fast.</li>
            <li>Was very healing and not greasy or oily feeling.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this seller and will keep using this product and maybe even try something else from the whole line of products based on Manuka honey.</li>
            <li>She was embarrassed and left quickly.</li>
            <li>I recently decided to make the switch to natural products, and this product is filled with ingredients found in nature.</li>
            <li>Of course, it could just be coincidental that my skin cleared when I used it, but I would highly recommend trying it if you have a skin problem.  </li>
            <li>This worked much better than any medication I was prescribed or any other natural product or dietary change I tried.  </li>
            <li>I will definetly buy wild naturals again!!</li>
            <li>A great product; unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for my dermatitis.</li>
            <li>Very prompt and professional response.</li>
            <li>They seem pretty much the same).</li>
            <li>i have tried a few topical moisturzers and hand down this one seems best by far</li>
            <li>It arrived and I opened it and was yet again excited to not really smell any fragrance</li>
            <li>However, I cannot say how effective it is against psoriasis and other skin eruptions since I only recently started using it.</li>
            <li>I put it on the first night, and my skin looked at least 85% better the next morning.  </li>
            <li>I was drawn to it because of its natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>(I am sensitive to some scents), I asked my friend to try it.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>but my skin is soft.</li>
            <li>it causes the whole face red with worsening of itching.</li>
            <li>I bought this moisturizer for my boyfriend because he has sensitive skin and was using garbage moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Feels light on the skin, and a little really does go a long way.</li>
            <li>The Wild Naturals cream does seem to help calm it down.</li>
            <li>I have been using this cream for probably almost a month now, and I have noticed that it does absolutely nothing for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>It is better priced them the other natural honey facial moisturizers I was looking into and looked to have about the same essential ingredients, so needless to say I was pretty excited when I purchased this product.</li>
            <li>I do not know where all the positive reviews came from, but maybe I am just bitter about it not working for me.</li>
            <li>Like a lot, I feel like it leaves my skin a bit dry, so I reapply maybe an hour again after my first initial application.</li>
            <li>The cream i&#x27;m writing a review about right now has practically the same ingridients as that other one.</li>
            <li>The packaging seems to have changed from the clear container to the white container.</li>
            <li>i have noticed i use it on my face and has no oily or sticky residue it has a nice faint honey smell too</li>
            <li>I live in Colorado and it is dry</li>
            <li>The smell is a little off putting but nothing too intense.</li>

            <li> The smell is a little off putting but nothing too intense.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have the dry constant itch I was dealing with prior to using the cream.</li>
            <li> I was ready for some relief &amp; can&#x27;t get to the dermatologist for another few weeks!</li>
            <li> I expect this to last me a long time.</li>
            <li> I still have rosacea, but with this Manuka Honey Moisturizer Skin Cream my face is far less irritated</li>
            <li> But that other cream from another seller is more expensive in compared with the Manuka cream from this vendor.</li>
            <li> I thought perhaps it was a fluke, but within just a few days, the problem completely disappeared and has never returned.  </li>
            <li> helps with dry skin i have very dry skin especially my face</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it besides the faint smell!</li>
            <li> I ordered this one for my daughter.she told that it worked OK(If not great) for the first bottle, but stopped working after that.</li>
            <li> Have used on a variety of extreme skin issues including Rosacea, cracked and bleeding heels, sun burn, badly dry cuticles, minor abrasions, etc.  </li>
            <li> My skin was very dry this winter.</li>
            <li> Besides there was some issue due to the packaging.</li>
            <li> I gave a try to this cream because of other people reviews</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t finish using it due to that.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this is something to be expected of the other honey moisturizers I was looking into or just this one because it was at a lowered price, either way</li>
            <li> much less write a product review</li>
            <li> My cream helped my skin but half way through the container it took on a curdled milk type of smell</li>
            <li> I usually use expensive dept store brands/ but the Manuka moisturizer was very hydrating</li>
            <li> I still apply the cream about every other day, just a bit, even though I have no more symptoms.  </li>

            <li> I had a terrible case of sebborheic dermatitis -- like a facial rash -- that had been plaguing me for at least 6 months.  I came across this on Amazon, and decided to try it -- after all it&#x27;s guaranteed!  Well, I see why it is guaranteed!  It works!  I put it on the first night, and my skin looked at least 85% better the next morning.  I thought perhaps it was a fluke, but within just a few days, the problem completely disappeared and has never returned.  I still apply the cream about every other day, just a bit, even though I have no more symptoms.  This worked much better than any medication I was prescribed or any other natural product or dietary change I tried.  Of course, it could just be coincidental that my skin cleared when I used it, but I would highly recommend trying it if you have a skin problem.  After all, you can&#x27;t lose.</li>
            <li> A great product; unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for my dermatitis. But it is a great moisturizer and worked great on my chapped lips and dry skin. I live in Colorado and it is dry so the product was great for my every day needs. The reason I bought it was for dermatitis and it didn&#x27;t work. Maybe I need a higher concentration of honey.</li>
            <li> I have had so many problems with my skin. I am 37. I still have acne, and have just added the wonderful, wonderful problem of rosacea to it. For anyone with rosacea, you understand that it is extremely difficult to control. Anything sets it off. And NOTHING makes it go away without irritating other problems. So, anything I used to fix the rosacea brought back the acne, and anything used to fight the acne flares up the rosacea. It is a frustrating problem. I have actually determined that I have allergies or sensitivities to things. That is the only explanation for this problem. So, for about three years I have been dealing with my face issues. I was surfing Amazon one night, and I noticed this cream. I was drawn to it because of its natural ingredients. Every thing in this cream has been shown to help rosacea, eczema, dryness, acne, etc. Everything is natural, everything is good, and the price is right. So I bought it. Why not? Tried everything else. The first night I put it on and went to bed. Not kidding, the next morning my rosacea was greatly diminished. After one week - one week - my rosacea flare up was gone. I will never buy anything else for my face. I am set, I am sold, I am hooked. My son has many bumps on his arms, and we use this cream on that as well. It really does work. Thank you for making this product, my skin loves it! Try it, what do you have to lose?</li>
            <li> i have tried a few topical moisturzers and hand down this one seems best by far i have noticed i use it on my face and has no oily or sticky residue it has a nice faint honey smell too i will be a repeat customer for sure</li>
            <li> very healing.  Love manuka.</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer and noticed it helped my rosacea. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I would NOT reorder this. I tried it and discovered that it &amp;#34;sat&amp;#34; on my hands/skin and did not sink in. The smell was awful. I wouldn&#x27;t call it a &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34;, it was so strong and not at all pleasant. Thinking it just might be me (I am sensitive to some scents), I asked my friend to try it.  The one time she used it and went out to a store, people kept asking &amp;#34;what&#x27;s that smell?&amp;#34;. She was embarrassed and left quickly. The return time was past so I simply threw it in the trash. Maybe I had a bad batch but I couldn&#x27;t even use this on my feet at night since it didn&#x27;t absorb into the skin at all either.</li>
            <li> Recently started using this cream and unlike another brand I used, this one did not cause me to itch. It went on smoothly and does calm the skin. It calms itchy areas and provides adequate moisture. However, I cannot say how effective it is against psoriasis and other skin eruptions since I only recently started using it.</li>
            <li> It is very light but effective cream, I find a tiny layer does go a long way! I has a very light fresh and sweet smell that I love! I must say using it for my &amp;#34;weather-aggravated&amp;#34; rosacea, I do see a decrease in the redness already!!! It&#x27;s only been 4 days and I use it 4-5 times daily. I am sold on this cream and will be using it instead of all my other products!!!</li>
            <li> I just got it from the leasing office, can&#x27;t wait to try it</li>
            <li> Manuka honey has healed many of the strange irritations/rashes on my skin immediately.  This cream is a way to nourish the skin at the same time.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I have sensitive skin and I break out easily to any oily lotions.  I use this for my face. It is much better than neutrogena lotion!  I absolutely love it besides the faint smell!</li>
            <li> This cream is fantastic. I&#x27;m using it on my face and hands to treat severe dryness from the harsh winter we&#x27;ve had in the north east. Within a few days of use I noticed a serious improvement in my face and hands and I don&#x27;t have the dry constant itch I was dealing with prior to using the cream.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. I use it twice a day.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer. Very good ingredients and is light but keeps the face hydrated for hours.</li>
            <li> My skin was very dry this winter. After using the product for 2 weeks I noticed a big improvement. Will definitely buy more when needed.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s helping with acne yet but my skin is soft. Sidenote: The smell is a little off putting but nothing too intense.</li>
            <li> I usually use expensive dept store brands/ but the Manuka moisturizer was very hydrating-my skin looks great- I will reorder.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking internally Manuka Honey for several years already so i&#x27;m well aware of its wholesome effect on our health. I&#x27;ve come across this product online and decided to give it a try simply out of curiosity. I have no problems with my skin. Matter of fact it&#x27;s in a naturally good condition but we all strive for one or another improvement, correct? Anyways i&#x27;ve ordered the cream based on Manuka honey from another seller and have been extremely satisfied with it for that short period of time that i was taking it. It sinks right in,leaves that matte finish all the users report about, doesn&#x27;t give you any greasy feelings and is just very light, feels good on the skin. Whatever positive reviews you can read about this product are well grounded. But that other cream from another seller is more expensive in compared with the Manuka cream from this vendor. That&#x27;s why i purchased basically the identical cream from this seller right away. As soon as i started using it i became confident of keeping using it. The cream i&#x27;m writing a review about right now has practically the same ingridients as that other one. I was informed that the jars for all of them are even filled at the same place. So i&#x27;m pretty sure it is just as good as that other one. The only reason i gave it only 4 stars is because i haven&#x27;t actually used it (but i&#x27;ve checked the ingridients on both jars. They seem pretty much the same). Besides there was some issue due to the packaging. But the Customer Service was simply great and outstanding. Very prompt and professional response. I highly recommend this seller and will keep using this product and maybe even try something else from the whole line of products based on Manuka honey.</li>
            <li> I have been desperate to find something to help with my daughter&#x27;s terrible eczema without using steroids. The Wild Naturals cream does seem to help calm it down.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Great product...!</li>
            <li> I ordered this one for my daughter.she told that it worked OK(If not great) for the first bottle, but stopped working after that.</li>
            <li> Like a lot, I feel like it leaves my skin a bit dry, so I reapply maybe an hour again after my first initial application. It does not clogg my pores and I like the jar a lot.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizing cream. Did not work for my rosecea. Expensive for just a moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream for my daughter who has eczema on the face and arms. I gave a try to this cream because of other people reviews but it did not work and it causes the whole face red with worsening of itching.</li>
            <li> This cream may not be the cure for your problems but is sure one of the best option on the market. I recently have problems with urticaria and this helps to relief the burning and itching plus is not grease and smells good.</li>
            <li> Makes ones skin feel soooo smooth</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband after he received 2nd degree burns on his arms, hands, face and lower legs. It is working well for him and he likes it better than the 98% aloe gel he was using before because the cream adds moisture. There is no fragrance and it absorbs well.</li>
            <li> I bought this moisturizer for my boyfriend because he has sensitive skin and was using garbage moisturizer. This does not irritate his skin and provides lasting moisture. He loves it.</li>
            <li> Is helping areas of psoriasis. It does have an &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; woodsy smell. Could always add an essential oil if it is bothersome.</li>
            <li> Poor packaging. Received with the lotion oozing out of the sides of the jar. No smell, really. But feels amazing!!!! Does it work? Not sure, haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my skin; been using the product for over month.</li>
            <li> Very good, just too small.</li>
            <li> Have used for two months now. Skin texture and health is getting better by the day with usage of this cream. I am prone to breakouts and sky skin. Have tried so many different creams that it&#x27;s great to find something that works! My skin gets even worse in Utah winters, so I will update if the cream begins to fail on me then.</li>
            <li> Keeps fungal flaky facial skin patches from reappearing. Works far better super expensive prescription ointments and keeps my face moisturized and happy.</li>
            <li> I love this cream! I have a mild rash on my neck &amp; this cream cleared it up! I took a chance ordering because I you just never know. I was ready for some relief &amp; can&#x27;t get to the dermatologist for another few weeks! So glad I tried it &amp; I highly recommend it! Thank you! 😊</li>
            <li> helps with dry skin i have very dry skin especially my face and it helps smooth it out</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer, non greasy, light natural smell. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Feels light on the skin, and a little really does go a long way. I expect this to last me a long time. I recently decided to make the switch to natural products, and this product is filled with ingredients found in nature.</li>
            <li> I have a crazy schedule that barely leave me time to breathe, much less write a product review but I had to make an exception for this truly wonderful moisturizer.  I have tried literally hundreds of skincare products in an effort to find a moisturizer that wouldn&#x27;t upset my already irritated skin without any success.  Some products would work for a while, but I&#x27;d never found a permanent solution until now.  I still have rosacea, but with this Manuka Honey Moisturizer Skin Cream my face is far less irritated and I&#x27;ve seen an amazing reduction in my overall redness.  Thanks for a fabulous product!</li>
            <li> It was a present for a friend. He says that it smells great, it applies and gets absorbed easily, it is not oily and it is very soothing with his psoriasis..great product! :-)</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I tend to break out in rashes when I use the smell good moisturizers from my department stores, and my skin starts to get rather dry as the seasons change into autumn. I did some research into moisturizers with honey in them, because lets face it honey is awesome, and stumbled onto this one. It is better priced them the other natural honey facial moisturizers I was looking into and looked to have about the same essential ingredients, so needless to say I was pretty excited when I purchased this product. It arrived and I opened it and was yet again excited to not really smell any fragrance and then I applied it. I have been using this cream for probably almost a month now, and I have noticed that it does absolutely nothing for my dry skin. The only thing this cream does is not break my skin out in a rash. I am not sure if this is something to be expected of the other honey moisturizers I was looking into or just this one because it was at a lowered price, either way I am now yet AGAIN on the market for a moisturizer that does not break my skin out but does hydrate it. I do not know where all the positive reviews came from, but maybe I am just bitter about it not working for me.</li>
            <li> The packaging seems to have changed from the clear container to the white container. It doesn&#x27;t look better, but with this change, the consistency of the product changed for the better. I don&#x27;t have any skin conditions that I&#x27;m treating, But use this mixed with lotion (Stonybrooks) and sunblock (neutrogena). Before, the product would lump up when I applied it to my skin, but with the smoother consistency, that doesn&#x27;t seem to be a problem. I just used this to make my skin softer and heal any injuries fast.</li>
            <li> great product..make my skin feel geat.</li>
            <li> I have sometimes severe itching on my arms and this cream relieves and soothes the itching. I will definetly buy wild naturals again!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Have used on a variety of extreme skin issues including Rosacea, cracked and bleeding heels, sun burn, badly dry cuticles, minor abrasions, etc.  Was very healing and not greasy or oily feeling.  I will be purchasing more if this product to give as gifts.</li>
            <li> Great Skin Cream-Really helps clear up skin rashes !!!</li>
            <li> My cream helped my skin but half way through the container it took on a curdled milk type of smell and I couldn&#x27;t finish using it due to that.</li>
            <li> This cream is a lifesaver. If I slack off on moisturization, I can get a flare of eczema. This has stopped a flare right in its tracks. This cream GOES IN, it does not sit above the skin surface waiting to be rubbed off on your clothing. It has NO smell, no fragrances have been added and there are no nasty toxic ingredients to preserve it that require a masking fragrance. I am so glad to have found this product/company. The cream got here immediately and it has a plastic seal around the lid so there is no leaking and no one can tamper with it either. Great product in every way.</li>
