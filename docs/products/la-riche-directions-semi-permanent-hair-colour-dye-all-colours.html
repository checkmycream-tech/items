            <li>Best working toner I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>AWESOME.  </li>
            <li>Takes out brassy tones, awesome product.</li>
            <li>Loved this toner!</li>
            <li>These items worked amazingly!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost pleasant I&#x27;d say after rinsing.</li>
            <li>Amazing i love it is best</li>
            <li>Free shipping is an awesome bonus!</li>
            <li>wait a good amount of time between bleaches so you don&#x27;t wreck your hair.  </li>
            <li>(it feels strong and healthy after two, still, but I also take really good care of it, aside).</li>
            <li>Before using this product I had been having a full head of bleach highlights on naturally fair hair every 6-8 weeks for about a year.  </li>
            <li>Just as described and will purchase from again! :)</li>
            <li>much more cost affective than a hairdresser.  </li>
            <li>For the money I think this is the best white toner around.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see why anyone would spend more.  </li>
            <li>The result was bright bright beacon blonde.  </li>
            <li>I wish this worked, because my hair felt quite nice and soft afterwards, but the best toner I&#x27;ve found is Wella&#x27;s T-18 White Lady which, while a bit more damaging to your hair, yielded much better results for me.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper and more effective than this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Also get a decent purple shampoo to use once or twice a week to keep it looking super bright.  </li>
            <li>I now rely on AG sterling shampoo, and lightly toned conditioner.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be a fool and think you can put this toner on even naturally light hair and expect a result.  </li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t have this brand in America, and it was really nice that I was able to get it for a pretty reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I waited two weeks after originally bleaching my hair and bleached it again.  </li>
            <li>I then decided I just needed to go bright white all over.  </li>
            <li>The morning after that I used another full pot of this toner on my hair (leaving on both times for about 20mins) and the result was bright white...</li>
            <li>By comparison, Directions White Toner is definitely superior in terms of quality.</li>
            <li>is that arrives super fast in time to get my roots done :)</li>
            <li>Your hair may need to be super bleached to see a difference, so NO orangey tones/ brassiness, get the brass out before using this.</li>
            <li>I should have ordered the \\&quot;silver\\&quot; one instead of the white, Im sure that would have worked better.  </li>
            <li>Also, don&#x27;t expect a quick fix...</li>
            <li>It feels like ages at the time but its well worth it.  </li>
            <li>However it did fade out pretty quickly and my hair started to get gradually creamy-blonde again.  </li>
            <li>It was shipped quickly and I received it much sooner than amazon estimated.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s now almost like a white-gold color, and I really like it!</li>
            <li>So I think the next route I will try is just getting some manic panic ultraviolet purple, and mixing that up with some cheap white conditioner to make my own toner.  </li>
            <li>but it was a lovely creamy blonde.  </li>
            <li>It took a mere two weeks out of my life to get the best results.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In terms of strength, this definitely takes to the hair a LOT better than the Manic Panic brand.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;d buy it again based on this first use.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;d buy it again based on this first use.</li>
            <li>Something I think is not always easy to get with a white toner.</li>
            <li>Something I think is not always easy to get with a white toner.</li>
            <li>Good for platinum hair, but it doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li>Although the pink was super light</li>
            <li>You should have your hair a very light blond in order for the pink to work</li>
            <li>Like I said, just don&#x27;t expect miracles without decent prep!  </li>
            <li>So if you do decide to try this, I HIGHLY recommend checking this in 5 minute intervals, or doing a strand test first.</li>
            <li>So if you do decide to try this, I HIGHLY recommend checking this in 5 minute intervals, or doing a strand test first.</li>
            <li>it probably won&#x27;t do much for you.</li>
            <li>I then bleached it again a week later, yielding a really light gold color.</li>
            <li>it really works, but when you use it.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t have quite as much purple pigment as I would have hoped.</li>
            <li>So this didn&#x27;t really make much of a difference at all.  </li>
            <li>but this white toner on it&#x27;s own did not get my hair white despite my hair being a light bleach blonde color to start with.</li>
            <li>Shipping was incredibly fast, and I am very grateful for that.&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
            <li>Worked very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, it also fades out pretty quick to the desired white!</li>
            <li>The following morning I used the toner and my hair has been the same bright white for over a week.  </li>
            <li>(More that 15...but still less than 20)</li>
            <li>I bleached my (short) hair once from medium brown, yielding the super brassy, orange-y result</li>
            <li>You absolutely need to get it to a decent enough shade in the first place for it to work to its full potential.  </li>
            <li>First of all, have you bleached your hair to a light enough blonde to make it worth while using ANY white toner?  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure this will fade after a few washes.</li>
            <li>The following morning I used this toner (one full pot) and it near enough knocked all the brassiness and orangey tones right out.  </li>
            <li>first then brushed the bleach through the ends.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first time a toner has actually turned my hair lavender.</li>
            <li>my go a very pale lilac colour, which not only looks amazing and like you&#x27;ve done it on purpose</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clearly evident to me that the quality in general is simply &amp;#34;better.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Despite being a stronger toner, this is by far the patchiest toner I have ever used.</li>
            <li>And the smell is a lot more subtle.</li>
            <li>suppose if you had light blond hair, and you simply wanted to make it slightly less brassy looking but not quite white, this might be the toner for you.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about personal preference, and knowing this will fade quickly, the lavender doesn&#x27;t bother me TOO much, especially since that&#x27;s a problem caused from leaving it on to long, and simple based on my hair type.</li>
            <li>It also didn&#x27;t smell good, and it came in such a tiny little jar, AND it was more expensive than other toners Ive tried (17 dollars if you include the shipping)  </li>
            <li>Manic Panic just seemed pretty expensive for the cheap quality, and the smell was horrendous.</li>
            <li>(I have a lot of red in my hair naturally, which is what always makes this a problem).</li>
            <li>Got rid of all the green, and made my hair a very pale, white blonde which I loved</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much stronger, which was unexpected for me, and I left this on for slightly longer than what the directions said.</li>
            <li>Granted my hair is very fine and thin, it may simply be the texture of my hair, and next time I may try this at only 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>I used half the container of the toner to see what it would do to that level, and there wasn&#x27;t much of a change.</li>
            <li>I have black straight as hell Japanese hair.</li>

            <li> But despite some parts going purple, some parts of my hair were still slightly yellow, which I thought was strange.</li>
            <li> To date I have spent about £30-£40 buying the bleach and toner and various accessories to get this colour...</li>
            <li> I used the second half of this toner on my hair the next morning, and it definitely evened out and was less shiny-gold.</li>
            <li> It also left my hair slightly dingy over time.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s what I expected when I bought the colors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll likely order this again, if I do end up bleaching a third time, as I will want half for toning and half for mixing in with a plain conditioner.</li>
            <li> be very careful when applying</li>
            <li> had green hair prior to this which I had bleached over, but the green was still showing.  </li>
            <li> A note about the toner, if your hair will not bleach to a very VERY pale yellow</li>
            <li> I bought this in the hopes to replace my typical go-to toner, which was Manic Panic&#x27;s Virgin Snow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just slightly too warm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> One last thing...Don&#x27;t be afraid to leave on for longer than the recommended 15mins...</li>
            <li> But I am disappointed that this toner gave such uneven results.</li>

            <li> Loved this toner! It was shipped quickly and I received it much sooner than amazon estimated. A note about the toner, if your hair will not bleach to a very VERY pale yellow it probably won&#x27;t do much for you.</li>
            <li> Best working toner I&#x27;ve ever used, I recommend this to anyone trying to achieve snow white hair. Takes awhile to get here all the way from the U.K though.</li>
            <li> Good for platinum hair, but it doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> I bleached my (short) hair once from medium brown, yielding the super brassy, orange-y result (I have a lot of red in my hair naturally, which is what always makes this a problem). I used half the container of the toner to see what it would do to that level, and there wasn&#x27;t much of a change. I then bleached it again a week later, yielding a really light gold color. I used the second half of this toner on my hair the next morning, and it definitely evened out and was less shiny-gold. It&#x27;s now almost like a white-gold color, and I really like it! My goal was platinum, but I&#x27;m going to wait longer to see if I want to put my hair through a third bleaching cycle (it feels strong and healthy after two, still, but I also take really good care of it, aside).

            <li> it really works, but when you use it. Your hair may need to be super bleached to see a difference, so NO orangey tones/ brassiness, get the brass out before using this.</li>
            <li> well, I wont buy this again.  It didn&#x27;t have quite as much purple pigment as I would have hoped. (Manic panic&#x27;s \\&quot;virgin snow\\&quot; has the same short coming.) purple is what counteracts the orange tones. So this didn&#x27;t really make much of a difference at all.  I should have ordered the \\&quot;silver\\&quot; one instead of the white, Im sure that would have worked better.  Or perhaps mixed both this white toner and the silver toner.  but this white toner on it&#x27;s own did not get my hair white despite my hair being a light bleach blonde color to start with. It also didn&#x27;t smell good, and it came in such a tiny little jar, AND it was more expensive than other toners Ive tried (17 dollars if you include the shipping)  So I think the next route I will try is just getting some manic panic ultraviolet purple, and mixing that up with some cheap white conditioner to make my own toner.  Much cheaper and more effective than this.&lt;br /&gt;I suppose if you had light blond hair, and you simply wanted to make it slightly less brassy looking but not quite white, this might be the toner for you.  But I actually want white hair, or even silver, so this just did not cut it for me.</li>
            <li> Took some of the yellow tones out of my hair after bleaching but not all. It works for me though!</li>
            <li> Having tried every toner under the sun, I can say this was one of the duds. Toners work different on different kinds of hair, so for sake of reference I have black straight as hell Japanese hair. I&#x27;ve had my hair snow white for quite some time, and this was essentially just a fancy conditioner that did nothing for my color. I wish this worked, because my hair felt quite nice and soft afterwards, but the best toner I&#x27;ve found is Wella&#x27;s T-18 White Lady which, while a bit more damaging to your hair, yielded much better results for me.</li>
            <li> These items worked amazingly! Although the pink was super light :/ but that&#x27;s what I expected when I bought the colors. You should have your hair a very light blond in order for the pink to work</li>
            <li> I thought the content was support to be blue didn&#x27;t left the brass out of my hair</li>
            <li> Just as described and will purchase from again! :)</li>
            <li> Leaves hair too purple !!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> First of all, have you bleached your hair to a light enough blonde to make it worth while using ANY white toner?  If not don&#x27;t bother reading this review or buying this product, instead, go bleach your hair.  Now.  Three times if thats what it takes, then buy this product!  Before using this product I had been having a full head of bleach highlights on naturally fair hair every 6-8 weeks for about a year.  I then decided I just needed to go bright white all over.  I bleached my hair using Loreal Maximum blonde bleach kit (using both sachets) I bleached my three inches of regrowth first then brushed the bleach through the ends.  The result was bright bright beacon blonde.  The following morning I used this toner (one full pot) and it near enough knocked all the brassiness and orangey tones right out.  It wasn&#x27;t white but it was a lovely creamy blonde.  The morning after that I used another full pot of this toner on my hair (leaving on both times for about 20mins) and the result was bright white...AWESOME.  However it did fade out pretty quickly and my hair started to get gradually creamy-blonde again.  I waited two weeks after originally bleaching my hair and bleached it again.  The following morning I used the toner and my hair has been the same bright white for over a week.  To date I have spent about £30-£40 buying the bleach and toner and various accessories to get this colour...much more cost affective than a hairdresser.  Don&#x27;t be a fool and think you can put this toner on even naturally light hair and expect a result.  You absolutely need to get it to a decent enough shade in the first place for it to work to its full potential.  Also, don&#x27;t expect a quick fix...wait a good amount of time between bleaches so you don&#x27;t wreck your hair.  It took a mere two weeks out of my life to get the best results.  It feels like ages at the time but its well worth it.  Also get a decent purple shampoo to use once or twice a week to keep it looking super bright.  For the money I think this is the best white toner around.  I don&#x27;t see why anyone would spend more.  Like I said, just don&#x27;t expect miracles without decent prep!  Those who say \\&quot;I didn&#x27;t see any results\\&quot; are simply not doing it write!  One last thing...Don&#x27;t be afraid to leave on for longer than the recommended 15mins...All that will happen is your hair my go a very pale lilac colour, which not only looks amazing and like you&#x27;ve done it on purpose, it also fades out pretty quick to the desired white!</li>
            <li> This toner leaves me with mixed feelings, as you can probably tell by the title of this review. I bought this in the hopes to replace my typical go-to toner, which was Manic Panic&#x27;s Virgin Snow. Manic Panic just seemed pretty expensive for the cheap quality, and the smell was horrendous. It also left my hair slightly dingy over time. By comparison, Directions White Toner is definitely superior in terms of quality. It&#x27;s a lot creamier, and easier to incorporate in the hair. And the smell is a lot more subtle. It&#x27;s almost pleasant I&#x27;d say after rinsing. It&#x27;s clearly evident to me that the quality in general is simply &amp;#34;better.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of strength, this definitely takes to the hair a LOT better than the Manic Panic brand. It&#x27;s much stronger, which was unexpected for me, and I left this on for slightly longer than what the directions said. (More that 15...but still less than 20) Despite being a stronger toner, this is by far the patchiest toner I have ever used. It&#x27;s the first time a toner has actually turned my hair lavender. (I&#x27;ve never had that problem before) But despite some parts going purple, some parts of my hair were still slightly yellow, which I thought was strange. Granted my hair is very fine and thin, it may simply be the texture of my hair, and next time I may try this at only 10 minutes. So, I&#x27;m not totally devastated. It&#x27;s just a semi-permanent color after all and I&#x27;m sure this will fade after a few washes. But I am disappointed that this toner gave such uneven results. I almost feel like this toner doesn&#x27;t have enough blue tones in it for my hair. It&#x27;s just slightly too warm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said all that, would I recommend this product? Yes, but with caution. It&#x27;s about personal preference, and knowing this will fade quickly, the lavender doesn&#x27;t bother me TOO much, especially since that&#x27;s a problem caused from leaving it on to long, and simple based on my hair type. Overall, I consider it a plus that it&#x27;s a toner that can actually stick to the hair. Something I think is not always easy to get with a white toner. So if you do decide to try this, I HIGHLY recommend checking this in 5 minute intervals, or doing a strand test first. I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;d buy it again based on this first use. The next time I try it, I will leave it on for only 10 minutes.ly stick to the hair. Something I think is not always easy to get with a white toner.

            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> Shipping was incredibly fast, and I am very grateful for that.&lt;br /&gt;Made my hair extremely white, however it faded rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;It stains things so be very careful when applying&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again</li>
            <li> Amazing i love it is best is that arrives super fast in time to get my roots done :)</li>
            <li> Worked very well.&lt;br /&gt;I had green hair prior to this which I had bleached over, but the green was still showing.  Got rid of all the green, and made my hair a very pale, white blonde which I loved</li>
            <li> Takes out brassy tones, awesome product. Does no damage to hair actually it helps condition it. I definitely recommend for people looking for a toner that does no damage and does it&#x27;s job, to take out yellow tones.</li>
