            <li>and I love this curling wand for my hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love this curling iron.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I HAD TO BUY A BETTER BRAND</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this iron.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I use it to touch up some of the curls it is fantastic !</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Amazing it works as good as the refews and shipping was fast</li>
            <li>I love this wand.</li>
            <li>we receive it today and we love it .</li>
            <li>Very cheap came right on time, and the glove is perfect for accidental hand touches, but as said on the paper that comes with the package, is not for direct contact.</li>
            <li>she is so excited to use it!</li>
            <li>lol i didn&#x27;t use hairspray and my curls are still as new even after sleeping with them.</li>
            <li>The price is cheap but the curling wand isn&#x27;t cheap!</li>
            <li>Works just as expected, great price!</li>
            <li>DOESN&#x27;T REALLY CURL GOOD ON MY HAIR</li>
            <li>My hair usually never takes a curl, but it did with this amazing wand!</li>
            <li>but this makes it look bouncy and full!</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different curling irons and they all seem to curl my hair and make it looks great</li>
            <li>Curling made easy with this.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really easy to work with.</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly and you can do a curl in like 5 seconds .</li>
            <li>Easy to use &amp; can diversify my curl style.</li>
            <li>It did work cuz the voltage here is strong so the device got damaged 😖</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>I can do my hair so quickly with this!</li>
            <li>Wand is fine, used several times and it works great.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and curls nicely.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t fit all my hair around the barrel</li>
            <li>but when you hold your fingers really close to the barrel it does get a bit warm.</li>
            <li>I always do free shipping which it&#x27;s suppose to take 5-8 business days.</li>
            <li>so I recommend using the glove that comes with it until you are comfortable maneuvering it.</li>
            <li>Love this product and it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>I recommend this wand to everyone that wants lovely curls and an easy way to do it.</li>
            <li>Works great and curl stays long</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a good buy for the price, if you look at the curling wands available at the big box stores, none come close to being this inexpensive and a have heat control knob plus a glove.</li>
            <li>Light weight gets hot quick and with a little practice I get great waves/curls!  </li>
            <li>but right after I leave the house they fall out!</li>
            <li>I love it so much.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to go for the more beachy waves look and curling my hair with my straightener just wasn&#x27;t achieving that.</li>
            <li>I have thick hair and this wand worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li>The glove is cool and works well.  </li>
            <li>but the curls are gorgeous and last</li>
            <li>Gets nice and hot super fast too.</li>
            <li>It guves such nice curls and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use and does exactly what I want and need it to do to my hair.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly too.</li>
            <li>The glove is super itchy for me though, I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>I had never used a wand before, this is my very first time using one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very hot (of course)</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t need the glove but its very hot</li>
            <li>My hair LOVES being straight, but the curls I made with this want were easy, pretty, and lasted all night!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this curling wand for sure because it actually works and is so easy to use once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>I have fine straight hair</li>
            <li>Worth it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t expect refined curls, but if you like a more natural wavy look</li>
            <li>Worth the buy, no doubt about it.</li>
            <li>But other than that, I loved the product.</li>
            <li>Get&#x27;s WAY hotter than the average hot tool I have found which is a good thing for some....</li>
            <li>But of course I love to rock some PRETTY curls every once in a while especially for a fun event.</li>
            <li>It heats very fast and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>But who wants to load up on hair spray?!</li>
            <li>It broke, the first time i used it.</li>
            <li>I have to turn it back on and turn if off so many times while i do my hair, which takes about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>and it gets hot fast!</li>
            <li>I got pretty curls that lasted all day.</li>
            <li>, it gets extremely HOT.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well</li>
            <li>but does get quite hot and can be tricky to handle if you have never used a curling wand before</li>
            <li>First time i use a wand</li>
            <li>This curling wand is the whole package!</li>
            <li>Overall fantastic buy!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I used a &amp;#34;flipperless&amp;#34; curling iron.  </li>
            <li>this is my first curling wand.  </li>
            <li>and if you use it enough then invest in a better one.</li>
            <li>and it came exactly when it said it would.</li>
            <li>The gloves help a lot because the wand does get hot.</li>
            <li>It reaches the full temperature and perfectly curls thick, long hair!</li>
            <li>My hair is super long and fairly thick and it curled great!</li>
            <li>There were a lot of other brands, but this one had a nice color.</li>
            <li>Only took me about 15 mins for my whole head, and turned out cute.</li>
            <li>The ward quickly heats ups and closes down and has many heat settings....</li>
            <li>Also, it warms up pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Curls fast</li>
            <li>I really like it...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It made my hair really poofy/frizzy...</li>
            <li>But It Creates Really Bouncy Curls </li>
            <li>I have naturally straight hair and my hair</li>
            <li>It curls my hair really well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this wand, or any wand really, if you have issues with curls staying in your hair, because this really helps.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and curls  really fast just a couple of seconds</li>
            <li>, that doesn&#x27;t really hold curl well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it once and really like it.</li>
            <li>It work really good for thick hair</li>
            <li>I liked it but the glove is too delicate and it would brake after a certain time other than that it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>ago!!!i have very straight hair naturally</li>
            <li>This creates a beautiful curl and I love how I can make different kinds of curls using the different sizes on the wand no more flat hair!</li>
            <li>As with all wands, its easy to burn yourself, so you have to be careful.</li>
            <li>and it is going to cost me more than the actual product to ship back!</li>
            <li>day!&lt;br /&gt;The iron heats up quickly and has multiple heat settings.  </li>
            <li>I have really long hair, down to my waist, and I was able to curl the full length of my hair around the barrel.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this wand.</li>
            <li>I was able to do my hair in less than 10 minutes!</li>
            <li>Be careful as it does get Hot really fast!  </li>
            <li>It took a few tries for me to get the hang of it, but I love it now!</li>
            <li>No heat, light blinks for a few, then the wand turns off completely.</li>
            <li>Maybe I am just too old school for this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it twice but works VERY well</li>
            <li>And as for the job that is does well I&#x27;m surprised it wasn&#x27;t $100</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>Heats up fast, cools down fast.</li>
            <li>No regrets.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I am so glad i bought it.</li>
            <li> Wish I would have  discovered this magic tool year</li>
            <li> and I love this curling wand for my hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love this curling iron.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I HAD TO BUY A BETTER BRAND</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this iron.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and I use it to touch up some of the curls it is fantastic !</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Amazing it works as good as the refews and shipping was fast</li>
            <li> I love this wand.</li>
            <li> we receive it today and we love it .</li>
            <li> Very cheap came right on time, and the glove is perfect for accidental hand touches, but as said on the paper that comes with the package, is not for direct contact.</li>
            <li> she is so excited to use it!</li>
            <li> lol i didn&#x27;t use hairspray and my curls are still as new even after sleeping with them.</li>
            <li> The price is cheap but the curling wand isn&#x27;t cheap!</li>
            <li> Works just as expected, great price!</li>
            <li> DOESN&#x27;T REALLY CURL GOOD ON MY HAIR</li>
            <li> My hair usually never takes a curl, but it did with this amazing wand!</li>
            <li> but this makes it look bouncy and full!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different curling irons and they all seem to curl my hair and make it looks great</li>
            <li> Curling made easy with this.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really easy to work with.</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly and you can do a curl in like 5 seconds .</li>
            <li> Easy to use &amp; can diversify my curl style.</li>
            <li> It did work cuz the voltage here is strong so the device got damaged 😖</li>
            <li> I have fine hair</li>
            <li> I can do my hair so quickly with this!</li>
            <li> Wand is fine, used several times and it works great.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and curls nicely.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t fit all my hair around the barrel</li>
            <li> but when you hold your fingers really close to the barrel it does get a bit warm.</li>
            <li> I always do free shipping which it&#x27;s suppose to take 5-8 business days.</li>
            <li> so I recommend using the glove that comes with it until you are comfortable maneuvering it.</li>
            <li> Love this product and it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I recommend this wand to everyone that wants lovely curls and an easy way to do it.</li>
            <li> Works great and curl stays long</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a good buy for the price, if you look at the curling wands available at the big box stores, none come close to being this inexpensive and a have heat control knob plus a glove.</li>
            <li> Light weight gets hot quick and with a little practice I get great waves/curls!  </li>
            <li> but right after I leave the house they fall out!</li>
            <li> I love it so much.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to go for the more beachy waves look and curling my hair with my straightener just wasn&#x27;t achieving that.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and this wand worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li> The glove is cool and works well.  </li>
            <li> but the curls are gorgeous and last</li>
            <li> Gets nice and hot super fast too.</li>
            <li> It guves such nice curls and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use and does exactly what I want and need it to do to my hair.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly too.</li>
            <li> The glove is super itchy for me though, I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I had never used a wand before, this is my very first time using one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hot (of course)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t need the glove but its very hot</li>
            <li> My hair LOVES being straight, but the curls I made with this want were easy, pretty, and lasted all night!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this curling wand for sure because it actually works and is so easy to use once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> I have fine straight hair</li>
            <li> Worth it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t expect refined curls, but if you like a more natural wavy look</li>
            <li> Worth the buy, no doubt about it.</li>
            <li> But other than that, I loved the product.</li>
            <li> Get&#x27;s WAY hotter than the average hot tool I have found which is a good thing for some....</li>
            <li> But of course I love to rock some PRETTY curls every once in a while especially for a fun event.</li>
            <li> It heats very fast and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> But who wants to load up on hair spray?!</li>
            <li> It broke, the first time i used it.</li>
            <li> I have to turn it back on and turn if off so many times while i do my hair, which takes about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> and it gets hot fast!</li>
            <li> I got pretty curls that lasted all day.</li>
            <li> , it gets extremely HOT.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well</li>
            <li> but does get quite hot and can be tricky to handle if you have never used a curling wand before</li>
            <li> First time i use a wand</li>
            <li> This curling wand is the whole package!</li>
            <li> Overall fantastic buy!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I used a &amp;#34;flipperless&amp;#34; curling iron.  </li>
            <li> this is my first curling wand.  </li>
            <li> and if you use it enough then invest in a better one.</li>
            <li> and it came exactly when it said it would.</li>
            <li> The gloves help a lot because the wand does get hot.</li>
            <li> It reaches the full temperature and perfectly curls thick, long hair!</li>
            <li> My hair is super long and fairly thick and it curled great!</li>
            <li> There were a lot of other brands, but this one had a nice color.</li>
            <li> Only took me about 15 mins for my whole head, and turned out cute.</li>
            <li> The ward quickly heats ups and closes down and has many heat settings....</li>
            <li> Also, it warms up pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Curls fast</li>
            <li> I really like it...</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It made my hair really poofy/frizzy...</li>
            <li> But It Creates Really Bouncy Curls </li>
            <li> I have naturally straight hair and my hair</li>
            <li> It curls my hair really well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this wand, or any wand really, if you have issues with curls staying in your hair, because this really helps.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and curls  really fast just a couple of seconds</li>
            <li> , that doesn&#x27;t really hold curl well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it once and really like it.</li>
            <li> It work really good for thick hair</li>
            <li> I liked it but the glove is too delicate and it would brake after a certain time other than that it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> ago!!!i have very straight hair naturally</li>
            <li> This creates a beautiful curl and I love how I can make different kinds of curls using the different sizes on the wand no more flat hair!</li>
            <li> As with all wands, its easy to burn yourself, so you have to be careful.</li>
            <li> and it is going to cost me more than the actual product to ship back!</li>
            <li> day!&lt;br /&gt;The iron heats up quickly and has multiple heat settings.  </li>
            <li> I have really long hair, down to my waist, and I was able to curl the full length of my hair around the barrel.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this wand.</li>
            <li> I was able to do my hair in less than 10 minutes!</li>
            <li> Be careful as it does get Hot really fast!  </li>
            <li> It took a few tries for me to get the hang of it, but I love it now!</li>
            <li> No heat, light blinks for a few, then the wand turns off completely.</li>
            <li> Maybe I am just too old school for this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice but works VERY well</li>
            <li> And as for the job that is does well I&#x27;m surprised it wasn&#x27;t $100</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> Heats up fast, cools down fast.</li>
            <li> No regrets.</li>
            <li> I have a Revlon flat iron</li>
            <li> I like it so far, only did a few curls</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, but its a mess.</li>
            <li> I have a long pixie cut</li>
            <li> I like it, but long hair slips off.</li>
            <li> I have straight thick hair and have always have to expertly use my Chi to even have a curl</li>
            <li> I have thin flat hair that never curls with a regular iron, let alone stays the whole day.</li>
            <li> My only issue is that it flips itself over often due to cord placement.</li>
            <li> It takes some practice and can sometimes get a bit messy, especially if you have straight thick hair.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first thinking maybe my hair was so short for this wand</li>
            <li> It does its job, I was surprised at how well it works for being less than $20, but I use it almost everyday</li>
            <li> and I only have to hold the curl there for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> Not only is this wand cheaper, but it also has a less sleek barrel design that grips the hair, unlike the Conair You Curl!</li>
            <li> My hair is a little too long for this though.</li>
            <li> so be careful!</li>
            <li> I probably just got a bad one or something, but it only stays on for about 5 minutes at first while it heats up then</li>
            <li> You really dont need something expensive.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and this really actually works!</li>
            <li> I had to turn it down</li>
            <li> Use it every other day!</li>
            <li> I have really thick and long hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m supposed to hold my hair around the iron by using the little black glove.......</li>
            <li> Did the job and as long as I don&#x27;t drop it it should last me through my random curl jobs.</li>
            <li> I am horrible at curling with a flat iron whenever I decide to curl my hair and wanted a easy alternative.</li>
            <li> sections at a time, holding it there for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> Only used twice and it&#x27;s broken.</li>
            <li> WASTE of money....</li>
            <li> but I was afraid to adjust it that high because it would start smoking  a little</li>
            <li> Not easy to use</li>
            <li> but I just worked with small 1-2&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have hair that goes past my shoulders.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely thick, frizzy, and hard to manage!</li>
            <li> So its ridiculous.</li>
            <li> not more to say than that!!</li>
            <li> It is a little awkward until you get used to it</li>
            <li> It makes it difficult to curl hair</li>
            <li> but ill be trying it out again Sunday.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lightweight wand, so it takes longer for your arm to get tired!</li>
            <li> Glove is useless.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to use and the glove offered no protection from the heat.</li>
            <li> and then its not so bad.</li>
            <li> mine turned out to be the bad one.</li>
            <li> Burned the crap out of my arm and hand,  very difficult to use,  I do not like it and am returning it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it 3 times and haven&#x27;t been disappointed once!</li>
            <li> My hair is terrible when it comes to curling!</li>
            <li> CRAP!!</li>

            <li> Okay, so let me just start off by saying I have never used a better hair straightener then this! I have naturally curly hair, but its a mess. It&#x27;s extremely thick, frizzy, and hard to manage! However, I do straighten it a lot and then its not so bad. But of course I love to rock some PRETTY curls every once in a while especially for a fun event. I have tried so many different curling irons and they all seem to curl my hair and make it looks great but right after I leave the house they fall out! (And yes I have tried all types of hair spray as well.. But who wants to load up on hair spray?! Not me.) Anyways, I thought I&#x27;d try this straightener as my last shot for hope, and BOOM It is amazing! I don&#x27;t even need to use hair spray anymore, and my curls last all day/night. I love it so much. I totally recommend it!</li>
            <li> Fantastic! love it. my favorite styliny tool</li>
            <li> love love love this wand. It gave my the perfect curls that I was looking for, and trying to get with the flexi rods but could not.Very cheap came right on time, and the glove is perfect for accidental hand touches, but as said on the paper that comes with the package, is not for direct contact.</li>
            <li> It work really good for thick hair but I don&#x27;t use the glove.</li>
            <li> Bought 2 of these for my daughter&#x27;s. They love them. Great product.</li>
            <li> Gift for my teen daughter. .</li>
            <li> Love how my hair came out!</li>
            <li> It broke, the first time i used it. I probably just got a bad one or something, but it only stays on for about 5 minutes at first while it heats up then the time on gets shorter and shorter. I have to turn it back on and turn if off so many times while i do my hair, which takes about 15 minutes. So its ridiculous.</li>
            <li> My daughter has one and loves it, so I bought my niece one too and she is so excited to use it!</li>
            <li> I luv this curling wand, if gives me great curls everything and it gets hot fast!</li>
            <li> I love it! It works amazing. The glove does kind of smell. It makes it difficult to curl hair but I just don&#x27;t use it. The curling iron itself is amazing. I was nervous about it. I&#x27;m glad I got it.</li>
            <li> Get&#x27;s WAY hotter than the average hot tool I have found which is a good thing for some....I had to turn it down but it does a great job. I was not a fan of the glove...but that&#x27;s personal preference.</li>
            <li> Works great! No problems what so ever</li>
            <li> Works great! As with all wands, its easy to burn yourself, so you have to be careful. This one works great and is lightweight so it doesn&#x27;t get tiring holding it while you wave your hair. Highly recommend. Curls hold all day.</li>
            <li> Worth it!&lt;br /&gt;I love this curling wand it&#x27;s awesome and it gets ready very quickly. The price is cheap but the curling wand isn&#x27;t cheap!</li>
            <li> No regrets. Heats up fast, cools down fast. Curls fast and the glove is definitely necessary. Amazing product.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and curls nicely.  No issues at all.</li>
            <li> I like it so far, only did a few curls but ill be trying it out again Sunday. Good for the price.</li>
            <li> Received a great product in a timely manner!</li>
            <li> Awesome product for it&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> I have really long hair, down to my waist, and I was able to curl the full length of my hair around the barrel. I got pretty curls that lasted all day. This wand has settings that go up to 30 but I was afraid to adjust it that high because it would start smoking  a little, it gets extremely HOT. I set it to 20 and that worked well for me. I have a lot of hair but I just worked with small 1-2&amp;#34; sections at a time, holding it there for a few seconds. If I tried to go any thicker than that I couldn&#x27;t fit all my hair around the barrel and I would just get waves instead of curls. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with the glove unlike others have reported. Heat resistant gloves are not meant for sustained contact with the barrel, just to protect your fingers from burns if you accidentally bump against it. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to but when you hold your fingers really close to the barrel it does get a bit warm. It&#x27;s definitely a good buy for the price, if you look at the curling wands available at the big box stores, none come close to being this inexpensive and a have heat control knob plus a glove.</li>
            <li> Works well on my own hair plus extensions</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE! I use it all the time. It gives you perfect curls!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good and easy to use. Curling made easy with this.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it! I had never used a wand before, this is my very first time using one. It works pretty well and it&#x27;s really easy to work with. I was able to do my hair in less than 10 minutes! I am so glad i bought it. Another plus is that it arrived within 3 days!! &amp; no I did not get a 3 day shipping. I always do free shipping which it&#x27;s suppose to take 5-8 business days. I highly recommend this wand.</li>
            <li> Wish I would have  discovered this magic tool year ago!!!i have very straight hair naturally but this makes it look bouncy and full! Use it every other day! From kinky to lose curls to waves - I really like it... Actually love it! Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser suggested this so i would stop just throwing my hair in a pony.  Works great and curl stays long</li>
            <li> i love it, works awesome!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t bother with the glove, but the curls this makes are amazing!</li>
            <li> I got it in just 2 days and it works amazingly. Its one of the best curling wands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> my daughter uses this all the time</li>
            <li> Love it, makes beautiful curls</li>
            <li> I have a long pixie cut and I love this curling wand for my hair. It is so easy to use and does exactly what I want and need it to do to my hair. I was a bit skeptical at first thinking maybe my hair was so short for this wand but it works perfect and the curls hold really well too. I have fine straight hair and I try not to use products in my hair. So without any products in my hair, like hair spray, my curls hold. I recommend this wand to everyone that wants lovely curls and an easy way to do it.</li>
            <li> Burned the crap out of my arm and hand,  very difficult to use,  I do not like it and am returning it.  Maybe I am just too old school for this.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to go for the more beachy waves look and curling my hair with my straightener just wasn&#x27;t achieving that. This wand gave me the versatility that I needed to create different size waves and texture. Very easy to use but does get quite hot and can be tricky to handle if you have never used a curling wand before so I recommend using the glove that comes with it until you are comfortable maneuvering it.</li>
            <li> I loveeeee it!!!!! Gets nice and hot and gives me nice bouncy curls!!! not more to say than that!!</li>
            <li> My daughter uses it not me. She said it works great.</li>
            <li> Amazing hair wand!!! I have always wanted a wand a decided to get this. It was a great price and a great brand. I used it and even the next day my hair was still curled! We now call it &amp;#34;The Wand From Heaven!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Heats quickly and works great! I have straight thick hair and have always have to expertly use my Chi to even have a curl stay longer than an hour. This works great and holds curl all day. It&#x27;s very hot (of course) so be careful! My only issue is that it flips itself over often due to cord placement.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love this curling iron. It made my hair really poofy/frizzy... I like curling my hair with a straightener better!</li>
            <li> I got the Revlon Bold Expressions Flipperless Curling for my daughter, and she loved it. There were a lot of other brands, but this one had a nice color. Her hair came out curly! She&#x27;s going to do a tutorial on YouTube soon.</li>
            <li> Iv Only Gotten It Today But It Creates Really Bouncy Curls </li>
            <li> Yes made my Eayon Hair right from amazon look great love this wand!! Didn&#x27;t need the glove but its very hot so if u never curled your hair use it</li>
            <li> Awesome gets hot quick love that</li>
            <li> It was excellent and so cheap.! It works great and curls my hair the way I want it to, buy!</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my daughter. She loves it.</li>
            <li> This is a great curling wand. It heats very fast and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I liked it but the glove is too delicate and it would brake after a certain time other than that it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and this wand worked wonderfully. A great purchase.</li>
            <li> My hair is terrible when it comes to curling! It never stays! But when I use the Revlon curler my hair stays curled all day without hair spray!! I love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love it. Great curl,</li>
            <li> DOESN&#x27;T REALLY CURL GOOD ON MY HAIR I HAD TO BUY A BETTER BRAND</li>
            <li> It was great! My hair usually never takes a curl, but it did with this amazing wand! I suggest you buy it! It was not too expensive and worked magic</li>
            <li> This is amazing. It guves such nice curls and easy to use. Gets nice and hot super fast too.</li>
            <li> Way better than a curling iron! love it! I can do my hair so quickly with this!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this iron. Be careful as it does get Hot really fast!  The glove is cool and works well.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It works great with my hair! I just hope it keeps working like it&#x27;s been doing.</li>
            <li> First time i use a wand and i like it!</li>
            <li> This curling wand is the whole package! I switched from the Conair You Curl to this curling wand, since it was cheaper and I was heading to college! Not only is this wand cheaper, but it also has a less sleek barrel design that grips the hair, unlike the Conair You Curl! It&#x27;s a lightweight wand, so it takes longer for your arm to get tired! This curling wand has a temperature knob, not a button. It reaches the full temperature and perfectly curls thick, long hair! I will be recommending this wand!</li>
            <li> Only used twice and it&#x27;s broken. Will contact. Amazon</li>
            <li> It does its job, I was surprised at how well it works for being less than $20, but I use it almost everyday and it turns out great.</li>
            <li> I have a question does the mail brings it or the ups answer asap please</li>
            <li> It takes some practice and can sometimes get a bit messy, especially if you have straight thick hair. Just don&#x27;t expect refined curls, but if you like a more natural wavy look it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li> Fried my hair. Curls are hideous. Not easy to use</li>
            <li> I like it, but long hair slips off. Maybe I&#x27;ll learn the technique later. My hair is a little too long for this though.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Was all jazzed when it arrived. No heat, light blinks for a few, then the wand turns off completely.</li>
            <li> works great and love my curls!</li>
            <li> i plugged it in and it wouldn&#x27;t heat up. What a shame i read all the comments about how great it was yet mine turned out to be the bad one. I don&#x27;t know how to contact them for a refund because i have to ship it back and it is going to cost me more than the actual product to ship back!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my curling wand! I ALWAYS get compliments on my curls when I use it! I have naturally straight hair and my hair NEVER holds a curl, but with the wand I wake up the next day with my curls still intact. I definitely suggest this product to everyone. If you&#x27;ve never used a wand, it takes some time to get used to, but you&#x27;ll get the hang of it. I don&#x27;t use the glove. It makes it more difficult to grab the hair and it seems to frizz it.</li>
            <li> It works great it make  ur curls nice.</li>
            <li> I love it! It works great and makes curling my hair so quick and easy!</li>
            <li> Lightweight. Trendy style. Glove works, protects my fingers. Product gave me great waves. Overall fantastic buy! Shipped quickly too.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I used a &amp;#34;flipperless&amp;#34; curling iron.  It is a little awkward until you get used to it but the curls are gorgeous and last all day!&lt;br /&gt;The iron heats up quickly and has multiple heat settings.  The glove is helpful to avoid burns but it shouldn&#x27;t be used to hold the hair on the curling iron.  I have hair that goes past my shoulders.  I have fine hair but there is a lot of it.</li>
            <li> It did work cuz the voltage here is strong so the device got damaged 😖</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice but works VERY well</li>
            <li> Love it! Came in the mail very fast, wonderful condition, and works great on my hair! It is everything as promised.</li>
            <li> Great! ! Really happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Makes Beautiful Curls!!</li>
            <li> great product, shipped quick!</li>
            <li> Loved it. At first I thought that it was going to be to small but I was perfect. Love this product and it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love my wand! It curls my hair really well. I&#x27;d recommend this wand, or any wand really, if you have issues with curls staying in your hair, because this really helps. The only problem is that the glove doesn&#x27;t work at all and I kinda burnt my fingers while trying to use it. But other than that, I loved the product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a clip to hold my hair in place.  I&#x27;m supposed to hold my hair around the iron by using the little black glove....... you have got to be kidding!  A bald man must have designed this.</li>
            <li> takes a while to heat up.  great price.  this is my first curling wand.  may be a good idea to buy this one and if you use it enough then invest in a better one.</li>
            <li> It gives very nice curls, heats up quickly as well, so works for me when I am in a hurry. I love it.</li>
            <li> Wand is great! Glove is useless. The fingertips have opened up, like they didn&#x27;t sew the ends. Defective.  But I dont use it anyway.  Wand is fine, used several times and it works great.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this curling wand for sure because it actually works and is so easy to use once you get the hang of it. You can&#x27;t beat the price either and it came exactly when it said it would.</li>
            <li> this product was definitely what it said it was. And as for the job that is does well I&#x27;m surprised it wasn&#x27;t $100 lol i didn&#x27;t use hairspray and my curls are still as new even after sleeping with them. 😍&lt;br /&gt;Love love love!!! Shipment was as mentioned on arrival too.</li>
            <li> CRAP!! WASTE of money....its CHEAP for a reason smh never again !!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This works great! It took a few tries for me to get the hang of it, but I love it now!</li>
            <li> I am In love with this product!! Works really good</li>
            <li> Works like a charm ! I have naturally curly hair and I use it to touch up some of the curls it is fantastic ! Heats up fast and curls  really fast just a couple of seconds and I&#x27;m done!  I set it in between 20-25 and it works great. I love it! And at this price? You really dont need something expensive. Do not hesitate to buy it.</li>
            <li> Love this!!!! Its easy to use and works wonders!</li>
            <li> Works well and the glove is a life saver.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly and you can&#x27;t beat the price. Worth the buy, no doubt about it.</li>
            <li> Works well. Love it. The glove is super itchy for me though, I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> best curling wand ive ever used.</li>
            <li> loooove! ESPECIALLY FOR THE PRICE. my weave looks amazing with this</li>
            <li> everybody should order this now . perfect curling wand . the glove is amazing .</li>
            <li> teenage daughter loves it!</li>
            <li> I ended up returning this for a standard curling iron. It was difficult to use and the glove offered no protection from the heat.</li>
            <li> I just bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it</li>
            <li> my curls never hold and I don&#x27;t want to pay about $200 for a nume. this is the best</li>
            <li> Wand is great to have if you want those curly curls. It makes your hair look amazing and curls are flawless</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it&lt;br /&gt;Arrives on time</li>
            <li> Amazing it works as good as the refews and shipping was fast</li>
            <li> I love this wand. It curls really good. The gloves help a lot because the wand does get hot.</li>
            <li> My daughters wanted  me to buy this n we receive it today and we love it . It heats up very quickly and you can do a curl in like 5 seconds .</li>
            <li> Great product for the price easy to use!!</li>
            <li> Best curler I&#x27;ve ever used! My hair LOVES being straight, but the curls I made with this want were easy, pretty, and lasted all night! I&#x27;ve used it 3 times and haven&#x27;t been disappointed once! Great buy!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use &amp; can diversify my curl style. Nice!!</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and this really actually works! I love it!!!</li>
            <li> It works really good. I have really thick and long hair, that doesn&#x27;t really hold curl well. When I curled it my hair it held. Also, it warms up pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Great for beginners. Light weight gets hot quick and with a little practice I get great waves/curls!  I am horrible at curling with a flat iron whenever I decide to curl my hair and wanted a easy alternative. I have a Revlon flat iron so when I saw this inexpensive Revlon wand I thought why not try it. I would recommend it. Did the job and as long as I don&#x27;t drop it it should last me through my random curl jobs.</li>
            <li> I love this thing!!!!! This creates a beautiful curl and I love how I can make different kinds of curls using the different sizes on the wand no more flat hair! The ward quickly heats ups and closes down and has many heat settings....Worth the buy!!!!! Thank you Revlon!</li>
            <li> This wand is awesome. Heats up in no time and I only have to hold the curl there for a few seconds. Curls stay all day. I have thin flat hair that never curls with a regular iron, let alone stays the whole day. I&#x27;ll never go back to another iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it once and really like it. My hair is super long and fairly thick and it curled great! Only took me about 15 mins for my whole head, and turned out cute. I did burn my hands, even wearing the glove . But maybe with some practice....</li>
            <li> I could never get cute curls before! My curls last all day. Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> My sister loves it. Great for a teenager!</li>
            <li> Works just as expected, great price!</li>
