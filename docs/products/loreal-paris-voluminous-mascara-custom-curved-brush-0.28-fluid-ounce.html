            <li>The color is perfect.</li>
            <li>Of all the mascaras I&#x27;ve used, L&#x27;Oreal is the best.  </li>
            <li>and then it looks perfect.</li>
            <li>Excellent product that, for me, does not clump.  </li>
            <li>Best mascara.</li>
            <li>Amazon Prime is the best!</li>

            <li>It does a beautiful job in enhancing your eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff my daughter loves this.</li>
            <li>Great mascara...</li>
            <li>It works well, separates lashes and makes them look great.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s looking great</li>
            <li>The curved wand is great and this mascara does not clump up.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!!</li>
            <li>This one is does what it says it will, looks great, doesn&#x27;t flake and is a really good price.</li>
            <li>I have tried many mascaras &amp;amp; this one works the best for me.  </li>
            <li>I have fair skin and lighter colored hazel eyes, so the Brown is a great color for me.  </li>
            <li>Good product that I&#x27;ve used for years  </li>
            <li>Then when you do want to take it off, you need about 3 applications of a good makeup remover...</li>
            <li>The color is just right, and the product provides excellent lash coverage.  </li>
            <li>my favorite!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara!  </li>
            <li>Gives a nice length, great color, and easy to take off.</li>
            <li>I have always used this mascara, so I was really happy to find it available online through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice brown color.&lt;br /&gt;Curved</li>
            <li>Best mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried and I&#x27;ve tried A LOT, both drug store and high end brands!</li>
            <li>I have to warm my eyelash curler with my blow dryer in order to get them to curl.  </li>
            <li>kind of product.  </li>
            <li>(I know, I know) and woken up to nice lashes.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the best products I have purchased as far as mascara.  </li>
            <li>And looks very cheap.</li>
            <li>I like that this mascara has a curved brush because I get more coverage in one swoop and can reach the lashes in the corners easier.  </li>
            <li>My favorite Mascara of all time.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite mascaras.</li>
            <li>and I love the curved brush.</li>
            <li>I love the brush, I love how it goes on, I love the color.  </li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal is one of the more quality cosmetic companies for the price.</li>
            <li>My favorite mascara for years.</li>
            <li>I love the curved brush.  </li>
            <li>Its ok.</li>
            <li>This seems to separate the lashes well and remove most clumps.  </li>
            <li>, it goes on nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>The curved brush is better at reaching all of the lashes, but it does have the problem of having huge clumps on the brush when you pull it out because of its shape</li>
            <li>Provides good volume and doesn&#x27;t need to be reapplied very often.</li>
            <li>I like the curved brush and easy to wash off</li>
            <li>Washes off easily but stays on through tears, rain and sweat.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply</li>
            <li>This mascara comes in a Brown which is much more natural looking for a fair blond.</li>
            <li>The curved head makes it easier to apply and be precise.</li>
            <li>Mistakes are easy to clean up</li>
            <li>While I love most L&#x27;Oreal products like hair color and eye shadows, this particular mascara did not work well at all.</li>
            <li>I used another brand of mascara for years that I loved but is no longer available and this one is just as good if not better!</li>
            <li>So grateful to find this product consistently available at a good price; much less than retail.  </li>
            <li>It worked fine, but I think I&#x27;ll stick with the straight brush - it just seemed easier to use.  </li>
            <li>Leaves a few clumps at the very top of the lash, but those come off easily if you remove them right away</li>
            <li>Before using the mascara, I gently roll the wand on a clean tissue to remove any excess that may cause clumps.  </li>
            <li>It clumps very easily that is the only reason I gave it 3.</li>
            <li>but they are also very straight.  </li>
            <li>I love how thick and full it made my eyelashes, but that is the only thing good about</li>
            <li>First of all,  the design of the tube allows too much of the goo,  which L&#x27;Oreal is calling mascara, to come out onto the brush.</li>
            <li>Voluminous has been fine for several years.</li>
            <li>and I really like the curve in the brush.</li>
            <li>I like this mascara, it adds length without too much volume.</li>
            <li>It is very clumpy when applied, even trying to wipe it off before application.</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara</li>
            <li>I can really appreciate.  </li>
            <li>It is so much easier to use with the curved brushes and the brush itself is designed so the mascara does not clump up.  </li>
            <li>Love the dark brown color.</li>
            <li>I normally get the straight brush, but thought I&#x27;d try the curved brush.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It looks much more natural than black.</li>
            <li>However, it flakes constantly all day, right from the moment it&#x27;s put on.  </li>
            <li>there were new flecks on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li>Other wise its a typical mascara.</li>
            <li>A slight narrowing of the opening would solve this easily.</li>
            <li>But overall this is the best mascara I&#x27;ve tried - and I&#x27;ve tried some of those $20+ designer brands (most were horrible).  </li>
            <li>This is a great product--goes on well and comes off easily with a little cold cream and a tissue.</li>
            <li>But the problem is there is too much mascara being left on the brush when I pull it out of the container.  </li>
            <li>I already had old mascara in my drawer.</li>
            <li>and  it last reasonably well thru the day.</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara as a simple &amp;#34;quickly brush something on in morning</li>
            <li>It really takes the lashes to the next level.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the much more expensive mascaras available out there, but I always come back to the L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous with the curved wand.</li>
            <li>Coverage is just right - not too little - not too much.  </li>
            <li>I would wipe them off and then there were new ones the next time.  </li>
            <li>Going back to my Cover Girl Professional.</li>
            <li>With other mascaras, there seems to be too much liquid which makes the curl leave my eyelash</li>
            <li>/&gt;The bad outweighs the good, and I will not buy this again.</li>

            <li> /&gt;The bad outweighs the good, and I will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> This is the first mascara I have found that works well for my lashes that are short and hard to see.</li>
            <li> It is a Great mascara, but is very thin and is hard to achieve enough volume on your lashes- compared to other products.  </li>
            <li> It seemed old and dried up.</li>
            <li> the rest of the long work day.</li>
            <li> I tried this product a few years ago and thought it would have improved my now, but still the same problem.</li>
            <li> Not really all the voluminous you expect</li>
            <li> But - if your eyes get wet, be prepared for Twiggy-like marks all around your eyes.</li>
            <li> I normally use and love L&#x27;Oreal mascara, but this product with curved brush was the worst, almost unusable.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t clump up like other mascaras.</li>
            <li> Still, I prefer this mascara over other brands that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Other than that, no complaints.</li>
            <li> At about 3 months it starts to dry a little</li>
            <li> I like the Blackest Black and Black Brown.</li>
            <li> Apply in steps, little bit at a time, to avoid lumps and sticky eye lashes.</li>
            <li> Probably it&#x27;s not original product</li>
            <li> I comes off with a little soap and water.</li>
            <li> The only issue is that it hard to get the clumps off of the brush when you pull it out of the bottle since it is so thick.</li>
            <li> Went on too heavy.  </li>
            <li> The curved brush took me a coupe tries to figure out, but my method is to start with the concave side at base of lashes, and then rotate wrist so that the convex side is swept up through the lashes.  </li>
            <li> The mascara is a little to thick for my liking.  </li>
            <li> Used to use Almay until it was hard to find my color with the curved brush in stores.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clump or stick hard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find brown mascara with a curved brush in stores.</li>
            <li> but it was extremely hard to get off of my skin and eyelashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hard to put on with the curved brush, and it makes my eyes itch.</li>
            <li> Eyelashes stick together because mascara is thick and goopy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other expensive name brands and this one make my lashes look longer</li>
            <li> Have purchased in the past and was not clumpy, but not happy with the product this time.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not have oily skin, but the mascara would smear under my eyes and leave a scary black blob.  </li>
            <li> So sad.</li>
            <li> comes out in clumps, difficult to apply.  </li>
            <li> No need for fake eyelashes if you use this product.</li>
            <li> My wife very disappointed: a lot of color sticking on to the brush and so hard to apply it on your eye&#x27;s lashes.</li>
            <li> Maybe just a bad tube as i wouldn&#x27;t expect that from L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li> Terrible, awful, gooey, messy, hideous, retched.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.  </li>
            <li> really annoying.  </li>
            <li> The mascara itself is terrible.</li>

            <li> I like that this mascara has a curved brush because I get more coverage in one swoop and can reach the lashes in the corners easier.  But the problem is there is too much mascara being left on the brush when I pull it out of the container.  It leaves clumps of mascara on my lashes. The opening is too big to remove the excess.  I tried this product a few years ago and thought it would have improved my now, but still the same problem.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Excellent seller. I recommend it to everyone .</li>
            <li> I prefer curved brushes and this is one of the mascaras I use regularly. Used to use Almay until it was hard to find my color with the curved brush in stores.</li>
            <li> Great stuff my daughter loves this.</li>
            <li> Best mascara for your $$.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other expensive name brands and this one make my lashes look longer and it doesn&#x27;t clump up like other mascaras.</li>
            <li> My favorite Mascara of all time.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite mascaras. Gives a nice length, great color, and easy to take off. Doesn&#x27;t clump or stick hard. I like the Blackest Black and Black Brown.</li>
            <li> This is the first mascara I have found that works well for my lashes that are short and hard to see. This mascara actually lengthens like is says making me look like I actually have lashes and I love the curved brush.</li>
            <li> I like the curved brush and easy to wash off</li>
            <li> It is a Great mascara, but is very thin and is hard to achieve enough volume on your lashes- compared to other products.  It needs to be thicker, simply!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I have purchased as far as mascara.  It does a beautiful job in enhancing your eyelashes.  Would recommend purchase of any of the L&#x27;Oreal products for their makeup purchases.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.  I love the brush, I love how it goes on, I love the color.  Coverage is just right - not too little - not too much.  However, it flakes constantly all day, right from the moment it&#x27;s put on.  Every time I looked in the mirror (washing hands in the bathroom etc.) there were new flecks on my cheeks.  I would wipe them off and then there were new ones the next time.  I won&#x27;t use it again.  So sad.</li>
            <li> Washes off easily but stays on through tears, rain and sweat. At about 3 months it starts to dry a little but that is when it should be replaced.  L&#x27;Oreal is one of the more quality cosmetic companies for the price.</li>
            <li> I know have a subscription for this Mascara.  Easy to apply and I really like the curve in the brush.</li>
            <li> I like this mascara, it adds length without too much volume.</li>
            <li> It is very clumpy when applied, even trying to wipe it off before application. I will probably not buy this type again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice brown color.&lt;br /&gt;Curved brush&lt;br /&gt;Does not clump</li>
            <li> Great mascara...my favorite! Doesn&#x27;t clump and makes my lashes look thicker and longer. The color is perfect.</li>
            <li> Of all the mascaras I&#x27;ve used, L&#x27;Oreal is the best.  The color is just right, and the product provides excellent lash coverage.  The curved brush is another matter...it tends to clump the mascara, and sometimes I have to use a safety swab to spread the mascara evenly.  Still, I prefer this mascara over other brands that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The mascara is a little to thick for my liking.  Went on too heavy.  Maybe just a bad tube as i wouldn&#x27;t expect that from L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this purchase at all. It seemed old and dried up. I already had old mascara in my drawer.</li>
            <li> This mascara clumps with every use. Eyelashes stick together because mascara is thick and goopy. Also made my eyes red and itchy after use.</li>
            <li> Leaves a few clumps at the very top of the lash, but those come off easily if you remove them right away and then it looks perfect. Other than that, no complaints. Provides good volume and doesn&#x27;t need to be reapplied very often.</li>
            <li> You want your eye lashes to look natural-this is the look. Apply in steps, little bit at a time, to avoid lumps and sticky eye lashes.</li>
            <li> So grateful to find this product consistently available at a good price; much less than retail.  Now I can afford to replace regularly, as recommended by dermotologists.  Excellent product that, for me, does not clump.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> comes out in clumps, difficult to apply.  Have purchased in the past and was not clumpy, but not happy with the product this time.</li>
            <li> Best mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried and I&#x27;ve tried A LOT, both drug store and high end brands!</li>
            <li> Best mascara. I always throw one in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara for years. Love the dark brown color. It looks much more natural than black. The curved head makes it easier to apply and be precise.</li>
            <li> My wife very disappointed: a lot of color sticking on to the brush and so hard to apply it on your eye&#x27;s lashes. And looks very cheap. Probably it&#x27;s not original product(((((</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of mascaras, but always come back to L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Voluminous Mascara.  I normally get the straight brush, but thought I&#x27;d try the curved brush.  It worked fine, but I think I&#x27;ll stick with the straight brush - it just seemed easier to use.  But overall this is the best mascara I&#x27;ve tried - and I&#x27;ve tried some of those $20+ designer brands (most were horrible).  This one is does what it says it will, looks great, doesn&#x27;t flake and is a really good price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  I love the curved brush.  Mistakes are easy to clean up and  it last reasonably well thru the day.</li>
            <li> My go-to mascara....always!</li>
            <li> Its ok. It clumps very easily that is the only reason I gave it 3. Other wise its a typical mascara. Not really all the voluminous you expect but makes them longer looking.</li>
            <li> I normally use and love L&#x27;Oreal mascara, but this product with curved brush was the worst, almost unusable.  When pulled out of container, there would be big clumps of mascara attached to the brush requiring repeated manipulation of the brush in the container to somehow remove the clumps.  Finally I threw it out.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I have tried many mascaras &amp;amp; this one works the best for me.  I have plenty of eyelashes but they are also very straight.  I have to warm my eyelash curler with my blow dryer in order to get them to curl.  With other mascaras, there seems to be too much liquid which makes the curl leave my eyelash so it&#x27;s like I never curled them; really annoying.  This is the only mascara I&#x27;ve found that keeps my eyelashes curled.  Before using the mascara, I gently roll the wand on a clean tissue to remove any excess that may cause clumps.  This mascara lasts all day on my eyelashes &amp;amp; comes off with soap &amp;amp; water.</li>
            <li> Voluminous has been fine for several years.</li>
            <li> Good product that I&#x27;ve used for years  This mascara comes in a Brown which is much more natural looking for a fair blond.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find brown mascara with a curved brush in stores. Amazon Prime is the best! This is a great product--goes on well and comes off easily with a little cold cream and a tissue.</li>
            <li> Clumps clumps clumps!</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara as a simple &amp;#34;quickly brush something on in morning so I look like I tried&amp;#34; kind of product.  The curved brush took me a coupe tries to figure out, but my method is to start with the concave side at base of lashes, and then rotate wrist so that the convex side is swept up through the lashes.  This seems to separate the lashes well and remove most clumps.  I don&#x27;t have any issues with fading or crumbling throughout day, and have even slept in the mascara (I know, I know) and woken up to nice lashes.  But - if your eyes get wet, be prepared for Twiggy-like marks all around your eyes.</li>
            <li> Terrible, awful, gooey, messy, hideous, retched. First of all,  the design of the tube allows too much of the goo,  which L&#x27;Oreal is calling mascara, to come out onto the brush. A slight narrowing of the opening would solve this easily. It doesn&#x27;t take a rocket scientist or even an engineer to figure that out. The mascara itself is terrible. Clumpy, lumpy and gives you raccoon  eyes in a couple of hours. Then when you do want to take it off, you need about 3 applications of a good makeup remover... And then start all over in the morning with the remover again! Ugh. Going back to my Cover Girl Professional.</li>
            <li> I love how thick and full it made my eyelashes, but that is the only thing good about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not have oily skin, but the mascara would smear under my eyes and leave a scary black blob.  Not only that, but it was extremely hard to get off of my skin and eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad outweighs the good, and I will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> The curved brush is better at reaching all of the lashes, but it does have the problem of having huge clumps on the brush when you pull it out because of its shape</li>
            <li> One of the best mascara&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used. The only issue is that it hard to get the clumps off of the brush when you pull it out of the bottle since it is so thick.</li>
            <li> I just didn&#x27;t like this mascara!</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara, it goes on nice and smooth. I comes off with a little soap and water.</li>
            <li> While I love most L&#x27;Oreal products like hair color and eye shadows, this particular mascara did not work well at all.</li>
            <li> It works well, separates lashes and makes them look great.</li>
            <li> I used another brand of mascara for years that I loved but is no longer available and this one is just as good if not better!</li>
            <li> Hard to put on with the curved brush, and it makes my eyes itch. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara!  Nothing else compares.</li>
            <li> Now this is a brush I can really appreciate.  It is so much easier to use with the curved brushes and the brush itself is designed so the mascara does not clump up.  It really takes the lashes to the next level.  No need for fake eyelashes if you use this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!! I apply once in the morning and it&#x27;s looking great the rest of the long work day. The only issue I have is the curved brush makes it clumpy. Go Loreal!!</li>
            <li> I have always used this mascara, so I was really happy to find it available online through Amazon.  The curved wand is great and this mascara does not clump up.  I have fair skin and lighter colored hazel eyes, so the Brown is a great color for me.  I&#x27;ve tried the much more expensive mascaras available out there, but I always come back to the L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous with the curved wand.</li>
