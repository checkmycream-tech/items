            <li>This product takes out the frizz and makes my curls look amazing.</li>
            <li>Was thrilled that Amazon has it.</li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I used this product for more than two or three years, off and on, but mostly on.</li>
            <li>more and more Dove FrizzFree Shine in every day to counteract the frizzies (think Newt when Ripley finds her in \\&quot;Aliens\\&quot;)</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Gives me great definition in the very humid weather of a Florida summer.  </li>
            <li>i love the smell it gives my hair.</li>
            <li>This stuff is like magic.</li>
            <li>This is the best product I have found for calming the split ends-frizzy look on my long hair.  </li>
            <li>It leaves her hair very soft and the fly aways are always at a minimum.  </li>
            <li>I was very surprised and happy to find this inexpensive and effect product.</li>
            <li>It smells great.. and leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li>I have tried other products but this is the best for me.</li>
            <li>Sometimes after my hair is dry I need to apply a bit more of the cream to fly aways, but I&#x27;m ok with that.</li>
            <li>Nothing keeps it from getting knotted and nothing else has ever made it easy to comb</li>
            <li>Ok products , nothing special</li>
            <li>It was shipped quickly and now my hair is again looking fine!</li>
            <li>Best for frizzy hair, without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>Gets rid of frizz without weighing done my fine curly hair.</li>
            <li>It thawed and works fine.</li>
            <li>Makes hair shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light when applied to your hair.</li>
            <li>This product makes your hair smooth without leaving it greasy.</li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t use it for a frizz free shine.</li>
            <li>Not greasy and works well to smooth out hair</li>
            <li>Excellent on my 3 year old&#x27;s fine curly blonde hair!</li>
            <li>I am overall pretty happy with this product.</li>
            <li>This Dove stuff keeps my hair full and never strings up.</li>
            <li>and it makes my day a whole lot more</li>
            <li>I was super bummed when they took it off the shelves at stores.</li>
            <li>My hair looks great &amp; isn&#x27;t weighed down &amp; oily from it.</li>
            <li>This works great for my tight curls.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic (all day), and really does the job.</li>
            <li>It also feels fresh all throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I swear by this product and best of all it works better than expensive salon brands ( I know because I probably tried them all)!</li>
            <li>I style as usual and it looks great.</li>
            <li>This product works GREAT in small amounts.</li>
            <li>and this is my current favorite.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a smooth, soft shine, give this cream serum</li>
            <li>It is not the wonder product described in some 5 star reviews, but it works pretty well, provided that you apply it on damp hair.</li>
            <li>In warmer weather I just let my hair air dry, and this cream seems to help my hair curl up a bit more.</li>
            <li>Best leave-in we have found for my daughter who has long, thick, course, semi-curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I live in a humid environment and while this stuff isn&#x27;t perfect, it goes a long way toward controlling the frizz in my coarse, dry hair.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a variety of similar products over the years for my very thick hair, this one works the best.</li>
            <li>Great for thin hair.  </li>
            <li>and if I apply this serum before using heating element my hair looks so much smoother than without.</li>
            <li>Would not use close to scalp, could give greasy look if using to much.</li>
            <li>This product does not seem specifically marketed to people with curly hair, so if you have straight hair</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair.</li>
            <li>For years I&#x27;ve struggled to find a product that will keep the damn flyaways a from, well, flying away with my whole hairdo.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s honestly better on wet hair.</li>
            <li>After my normal routine of drying followed by straightening I put this in my hair and it takes away all the frizz, dry end and keeps my hair looking healthy and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I like it when curling or flat ironing my hair when I get that smooth edge to my curl or ends</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a good number of sprays, etc, but had to be willing to lose too much hair later on as it would be too stiff.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly hair that ends up frizzing when the humidity is high.  </li>
            <li>Love this when hair is wet!!</li>
            <li>Other serum-type products have been too heavy for my hair and looked greasy, but the Dove cream serum is light and nice.</li>
            <li>leaves hair very soft,  but can never find in stores, probably because everyone likes it!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to all my friends &amp; family.</li>
            <li>I have thick very fine hair and every morning I blow dry my hair and use a straightener which leads to my hair drying out and becoming frizzy.</li>
            <li>I love this product and use it everyday.</li>
            <li>It is cheap, works well at creating shine and maintaining frizz, and can be a lifesaver when you are running late and want some quick frizz control.</li>
            <li>Love this product can tame your hair while conditions</li>
            <li>(a huge problem for me with other products).</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product, and was having a hard time finding it in the stores.  </li>
            <li>it was like straw and this helped tremendously (with other items in use also).</li>
            <li>Soft beach waves- no oily residue.  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally frizzy and this tames it.</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair that tends to get frizzy with humidity.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spend lots of money buying products to knock out the frizz of the ends and leaves her curls set and soft.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how well this works.</li>
            <li>This product keeps my hair smooth and tame without making it look greasy and I still maintain my waves.  </li>
            <li>A small amount of Dove FrizzFree Shine Cream smooth onto the bottom 2 inches works wonders.  </li>
            <li>detangler!!&lt;br /&gt;We use it on my DD&#x27;s hair which is long &amp; straight.</li>
            <li>Dove&#x27;s Frizz Free Shine helps me keep my little short hairs under control.  </li>
            <li>Add it to my new daily clarifying shampoo (review to come)</li>
            <li>Now, though, my hair is as dry as straw and tangles if you so much as look at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>hold is not that strong, but that is secondary.</li>
            <li>My hair was damaged because of the first few months of my son being born</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very thankful to Dove for introducing this lightweight serum that promised and delivered a product to make my hair look so silky and shiny, without weighing it down and giving me a tension headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very greasy and weighs down my hair.</li>
            <li>All I do is shampoo, condition, brush it, and rub it in and brush it again once it&#x27;s dry and it totally straightens my hair and makes it soft and tames those flyaways.</li>
            <li>From the first time i used it, my dry, thick, wavy and frizzy hair got weightless and soft plus took the frizz away!!</li>
            <li>I use it daily before blow drying and to give my straight hair that extra little bit of smoothness it needed.</li>

            <li> All I do is shampoo, condition, brush it, and rub it in and brush it again once it&#x27;s dry and it totally straightens my hair and makes it soft and tames those flyaways.</li>
            <li> From the first time i used it, my dry, thick, wavy and frizzy hair got weightless and soft plus took the frizz away!!</li>
            <li> I use it daily before blow drying and to give my straight hair that extra little bit of smoothness it needed.</li>
            <li> I use it before styling, not only to prevent frizz but also to protect from the heat of blow drying and flat ironing.</li>
            <li> My curly, frizzy hair is so hard to manage but this stuff really helps mask the frizz and makes my curls shine!</li>
            <li> If anything after using this product my curls are straighter and my hair becomes very flat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Dove products for a long time.</li>
            <li> The directions on this state you can use it on dry or damp hair.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend using it on dry hair - it does leave the hair greasy and sticky if your hair is completely dry.</li>
            <li> And because I color it, it becomes dry.  </li>
            <li> I apply it after I towel dry my hair.</li>
            <li> Do not risk it on dry hair, as it will make it sticky.</li>
            <li> If you have naturally curly hair, you are personally acquainted with that annoying frizziness that tags along with it.</li>
            <li> This product will make your hair a little shinier, and it will tame your frizz to a reasonable level, but it will not define your curls.</li>
            <li> usually apply this to my hair when it&#x27;s wet, but it also works for taming last minute frizz.</li>
            <li> I naturally have big spirally, curly, thick hair that&#x27;s hard to deal with without conditioning.</li>
            <li> It does not make my hair feel like strands of iron, which is a bonus over some other control sprays.  </li>
            <li> The weight can be difficult when using certain hefty hair products.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, course, naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I guess its alright as far as frizz goes but not great.</li>
            <li> This works without weighing down your hair and doesn&#x27;t leave it looking greasy like the oils.  </li>
            <li> Creams are often too think and weigh down the hair while serums are often too greasy.  </li>
            <li> a person with thick, curly hair my hair is not only frizzy, but it&#x27;s heavy too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is less drying, no alcohol.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is really thick and curly and this cream-serum actually seems to tame it without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> But, if ur hair is a little greasy, put it in while wet/damp.</li>
            <li> Some products make the hair go limp when you curl or over curl it.</li>
            <li> I sometimes use it on fully dried hair and it&#x27;s helps the frizz a bit.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a few months ago to help tame frizz from my curls, make them shine, and define them.</li>
            <li> So, I had to try this when looking for something to tame it, since I also die my hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter also gets knots in her hair often and a little bit of this serum takes them out with ease!</li>
            <li> I have thick, thick, thick, long hair</li>
            <li> I usually apply it on my wet/towel damp hair after I shower.</li>
            <li> i think they are discontinuing it :/</li>
            <li> This hair product is really hard to find so when I discovered it on Amazon</li>
            <li> Its hard to find in target and walmart along with Cvs and Walgreen.</li>
            <li> This cream serum works for my thick, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad that the major retailers don&#x27;t carry this product.  </li>
            <li> I wish Dove would put it back on the shelves!! :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so so saddened that I&#x27;ve been unable to find it these past couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m lost and confused and have frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m terribly distraught.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like artificial scent at all</li>
            <li> (:(:(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Dove&#x27;s Frizz Free Shine helps me keep my little short hairs under control.  It does not make my hair feel like strands of iron, which is a bonus over some other control sprays.  I like this stuff and the look it gives me.</li>
            <li> it smells soooo good and works so good too</li>
            <li> Great for thin hair.  Adds volume and shine.  Can no longer find it locally.  Was thrilled that Amazon has it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of defrizzers... and this is my current favorite.  This works without weighing down your hair and doesn&#x27;t leave it looking greasy like the oils.  I use it daily before blow drying and to give my straight hair that extra little bit of smoothness it needed.</li>
            <li> Frizz-free. Soft beach waves- no oily residue.  Hope this never gets discontinued bc it&#x27;s the only thing I need for perfect hair</li>
            <li> I like it when curling or flat ironing my hair when I get that smooth edge to my curl or ends and if I apply this serum before using heating element my hair looks so much smoother than without. Would not use close to scalp, could give greasy look if using to much. I think that this product holds up to salon quality without the price. Makes hair shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> I used this when I curl my hair. Some products make the hair go limp when you curl or over curl it. It begins to look stringy by the end of the day. This Dove stuff keeps my hair full and never strings up.</li>
            <li> the picture showed 3 tubes, So I paid for 1,17.00 for 1</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe Dove is discontinuing this stuff, it&#x27;s amazing. It smells terrific and does an awesome job of keeping your hair from frizzing without making it too oily (a huge problem for me with other products). The key is to only use a tiny bit, rub it between your hands, and then apply from the under layers of your hair up through the rest, staying an inch or so away from your roots and focusing on the ends. It smells fantastic (all day), and really does the job. I have thick, thick, thick, long hair and I can ONLY use this product, everything else makes my hair too oily or I see no change at all. Definitely give it a try! I wish Dove would put it back on the shelves!! :(</li>
            <li> This works great for my tight curls. Wish the bottle was bigger</li>
            <li> The directions on this state you can use it on dry or damp hair. I have used it on damp hair, and it works well - straightens without leaving the hair greasy or sticky. I would not recommend using it on dry hair - it does leave the hair greasy and sticky if your hair is completely dry. However, it smells great and I will probably use it again.</li>
            <li> This hair product is really hard to find so when I discovered it on Amazon I was really happy! My hair is really thick and curly and this cream-serum actually seems to tame it without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Ok products , nothing special</li>
            <li> I have very thick, course, naturally curly hair.  And because I color it, it becomes dry.  I use this every morning and it keeps my hair feeling great all day!</li>
            <li> I bought this product a few months ago to help tame frizz from my curls, make them shine, and define them. This product does not seem specifically marketed to people with curly hair, so if you have straight hair I would still recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually apply this to my hair when it&#x27;s wet, but it also works for taming last minute frizz. This product will make your hair a little shinier, and it will tame your frizz to a reasonable level, but it will not define your curls. If anything after using this product my curls are straighter and my hair becomes very flat. This is why I use it combined with a curl enhancing cream.  I am overall pretty happy with this product. It is cheap, works well at creating shine and maintaining frizz, and can be a lifesaver when you are running late and want some quick frizz control.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product, and was having a hard time finding it in the stores.  It was shipped quickly and now my hair is again looking fine!</li>
            <li> This anti-frizz product actually works. It&#x27;s light when applied to your hair. I apply it after I towel dry my hair. I style as usual and it looks great. My hair is naturally frizzy and this tames it. I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. My curly, frizzy hair is so hard to manage but this stuff really helps mask the frizz and makes my curls shine!</li>
            <li> Best leave-in we have found for my daughter who has long, thick, course, semi-curly hair.  It leaves her hair very soft and the fly aways are always at a minimum.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff! I have very curly hair. I use this daily! Its hard to find in target and walmart along with Cvs and Walgreen. It seems like some stores sell it. One walmart may have it the next wont</li>
            <li> I use it before styling, not only to prevent frizz but also to protect from the heat of blow drying and flat ironing.</li>
            <li> better price than in store for product I love!</li>
            <li> I have tried a variety of similar products over the years for my very thick hair, this one works the best.</li>
            <li> Excellent highly recommended</li>
            <li> I was super bummed when they took it off the shelves at stores. This product makes your hair smooth without leaving it greasy. It also feels fresh all throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Love this product can tame your hair while conditions</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Gets rid of frizz without weighing done my fine curly hair.</li>
            <li> If you have naturally curly hair, you are personally acquainted with that annoying frizziness that tags along with it. For years I&#x27;ve struggled to find a product that will keep the damn flyaways a from, well, flying away with my whole hairdo. I&#x27;m very thankful to Dove for introducing this lightweight serum that promised and delivered a product to make my hair look so silky and shiny, without weighing it down and giving me a tension headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a person with thick, curly hair my hair is not only frizzy, but it&#x27;s heavy too. The weight can be difficult when using certain hefty hair products. This serum made my hair feel LIGHTER on my shoulders. Add it to my new daily clarifying shampoo (review to come) and it makes my day a whole lot more relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an eighteen-year-old soon-to-be college student, and I come from a lower middle class family. No way can I afford those twelve, twenty dollar salon hair products. I was very surprised and happy to find this inexpensive and effect product. If you&#x27;re looking for a smooth, soft shine, give this cream serum a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Warning: Do not put this product on roots. I would advise not to put ANY kind of smoothing cream/serum on hair roots. It&#x27;ll make hair oily instead of shiny. This product works GREAT in small amounts. I&#x27;d say a dime sized amount is all it takes.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t make hair look greasy, but controls frizz.  leaves hair very soft,  but can never find in stores, probably because everyone likes it!</li>
            <li> This cream serum works for my thick, wavy hair. In warmer weather I just let my hair air dry, and this cream seems to help my hair curl up a bit more. Sometimes after my hair is dry I need to apply a bit more of the cream to fly aways, but I&#x27;m ok with that. Light, pleasant scent. Other serum-type products have been too heavy for my hair and looked greasy, but the Dove cream serum is light and nice. I&#x27;ve had good results blow-drying my hair with this as well.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! From the first time i used it, my dry, thick, wavy and frizzy hair got weightless and soft plus took the frizz away!! Love it!</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have found for calming the split ends-frizzy look on my long hair.  A small amount of Dove FrizzFree Shine Cream smooth onto the bottom 2 inches works wonders.  I have tried other products but this is the best for me.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair so it gets frizzy after I wash it. This product takes out the frizz and makes my curls look amazing. I love it. I can&#x27;t find it at any stores so I get it here on Amazon. I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> works well, hair seems to benefit.  hold is not that strong, but that is secondary. will buy again. thank you</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product! I have thick very fine hair and every morning I blow dry my hair and use a straightener which leads to my hair drying out and becoming frizzy. After my normal routine of drying followed by straightening I put this in my hair and it takes away all the frizz, dry end and keeps my hair looking healthy and moisturized. I have tried all the oils and creams in existence and nothing compares to this Dove serum! My daughter also gets knots in her hair often and a little bit of this serum takes them out with ease!</li>
            <li> I was iffy about this before I bought it because I do not like products that make my hair feel gunky or greasy. This stuff works great. It smells great.. and leaves my hair soft. I have think course asian hair that is bleached and fried. I usually apply it on my wet/towel damp hair after I shower. I sometimes use it on fully dried hair and it&#x27;s helps the frizz a bit. But it&#x27;s honestly better on wet hair.</li>
            <li> Best for frizzy hair, without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Works like it says it does</li>
            <li> It is not the wonder product described in some 5 star reviews, but it works pretty well, provided that you apply it on damp hair. Do not risk it on dry hair, as it will make it sticky.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair that tends to get frizzy with humidity.  This product keeps my hair smooth and tame without making it look greasy and I still maintain my waves.  I swear by this product and best of all it works better than expensive salon brands ( I know because I probably tried them all)!</li>
            <li> GREAT product! my wife LOVES IT! problem is- i think they are discontinuing it :/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Dove products for a long time. These was a good price and arrived quickly. I took away one star only because the product froze while it shipped during a winter storm. It thawed and works fine. I would have preferred they waited to ship it or noted in the product description it will freeze, etc.</li>
            <li> I have medium curly hair. I used this product for more than two or three years, off and on, but mostly on. I&#x27;ve tried many frizz creams and serums, and Dove FrizzFree Shine worked the best. It&#x27;s got a pleasant smell and really did a great job smoothing and defining my curls. Now, though, my hair is as dry as straw and tangles if you so much as look at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I noticed I was putting more and more Dove FrizzFree Shine in every day to counteract the frizzies (think Newt when Ripley finds her in \\&quot;Aliens\\&quot;), I put two and two together and stopped using this product. Now, I&#x27;m lost and confused and have frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I switched from mousse to this cream.&lt;br /&gt;It is less drying, no alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;I order 2 bottles at a time and keep it on hand.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair that ends up frizzing when the humidity is high.  I love this product and use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I live in a humid environment and while this stuff isn&#x27;t perfect, it goes a long way toward controlling the frizz in my coarse, dry hair.  And for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! We don&#x27;t use it for a frizz free shine. It&#x27;s our #1 &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; detangler!!&lt;br /&gt;We use it on my DD&#x27;s hair which is long &amp; straight. She always gets knots (rats nest) on the under side of her hair and this is the ONLY thing I&#x27;ve ever found that detangles! We&#x27;ve tried 1, 2, and several braids and ponytails. Nothing keeps it from getting knotted and nothing else has ever made it easy to comb out.&lt;br /&gt;We can&#x27;t do without it especially at the beach where her entire head of hair is beat into tangles by the surf AND at the pool where the flips and chlorine wreak havoc. I&#x27;m so so saddened that I&#x27;ve been unable to find it these past couple of weeks. I&#x27;m assuming Dove has stopped making it and I&#x27;m terribly distraught. :(:(:(</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Creams are often too think and weigh down the hair while serums are often too greasy.  This is a perfect balance of both so my hair looks great and shows no frizz.</li>
            <li> Love this product! My hair looks great &amp; isn&#x27;t weighed down &amp; oily from it. I highly recommend it to all my friends &amp; family.</li>
            <li> Styles my curls, without flatening them.  Gives me great definition in the very humid weather of a Florida summer.  I just part hair. Put a bit of the product.  Twist, pin and an hour or next day later, I shake the hair. That&#x27;s my Friday or emergency go out look.  Best part is that it&#x27;s easy to comb the hair out afterwards.  I&#x27;ve used a good number of sprays, etc, but had to be willing to lose too much hair later on as it would be too stiff.  This product, is much more forgiving and smells really great.</li>
            <li> i love the smell it gives my hair. I guess its alright as far as frizz goes but not great.</li>
            <li> Very greasy and weighs down my hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent on my 3 year old&#x27;s fine curly blonde hair! Saw this product and figured why not? I&#x27;ve spend lots of money buying products to knock out the frizz of the ends and leaves her curls set and soft. The best product and the price cannot be beat.</li>
            <li> Love this when hair is wet!!</li>
            <li> Best defrizz item I&#x27;ve used! This is my second bottle already! I naturally have big spirally, curly, thick hair that&#x27;s hard to deal with without conditioning. So, I had to try this when looking for something to tame it, since I also die my hair. This is AMAZING! It transforms my hair! All I do is shampoo, condition, brush it, and rub it in and brush it again once it&#x27;s dry and it totally straightens my hair and makes it soft and tames those flyaways. But, if ur hair is a little greasy, put it in while wet/damp.</li>
            <li> This stuff is like magic. I was surprised how well this works. My hair was damaged because of the first few months of my son being born I just tied my hair up in a knot and didn&#x27;t do anything to it. After I had it colored it was like straw and this helped tremendously (with other items in use also). Great product and it is a definite must have!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad that the major retailers don&#x27;t carry this product.  It is the best body creme and frizz free shine product on the market.</li>
            <li> Not greasy and works well to smooth out hair but I don&#x27;t like artificial scent at all</li>
