            <li>I think that is good or maybe not....</li>
            <li>It smell very good smoothly.</li>
            <li>A great scent, I love it and</li>
            <li>This is good if you love iris, not so good if you don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>This smells amazing.  </li>
            <li>It is really a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s on your own...</li>
            <li>This gives the lavender a sweetness and a depth that is unusual and excellent.</li>
            <li>I was given a sample of this product in a Pharmacy in the country of Panama and liked it.  </li>
            <li>Rather, it is a feminine one marketed as being so unique in that Dior could market it successfully to men, despite the fact it is SO feminine.  </li>
            <li>It was delivered and sealed not to break which is very important.  </li>
            <li>Oh my goodness I love this stuff..</li>
            <li>I tried Neiman&#x27;s and they were more helpful but did not have it either.  </li>
            <li>Love every Dior product and this is one more on the list</li>
            <li>So, reformulation for sure.</li>
            <li>My husband love this gift</li>
            <li>and I think I love it on him better than anything he&#x27;s worn in years.  </li>
            <li>Dior Homme is one of my top 5 favorite men&#x27;s fragrances.</li>
            <li>I love the way this smells on my skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a quality fragrance, a fantastic buy!</li>
            <li>It is interesting to compare it to La Nuit, by YSL.</li>
            <li>Probably not the best choice as a daily use cologne, especially in hot climates.</li>
            <li>My all time favorite.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t smell like that.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>very unique (you&#x27;re not going to smell anything else like it--except for Dior Homme</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>Sure, if you are confident in your metrosexuality this will be fine for you.  </li>
            <li>What you will get is this this magnificent &amp; gentle scent-bubble of pure bliss (&amp; envy).</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing smelling cologne I had ever smelled, if you enjoy a light yet bold smelling scent that will have the women in your office looking at you</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s something more from the original formulation, circa 2005.</li>
            <li>This was a Christams present for my husband and he loved it!  </li>
            <li>The best part of this fragrance is the drydown when my skin starts getting a little more oily at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>I recieved my purchase in less than 3 days during the Christmas holiday season; very awesome.  </li>
            <li>Personally, although I love when women love what I wear, I have to love it as well, and in this case, I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;Men who can wear this are those who love it and don&#x27;t care what others think, or those who have a strong feminine side.  </li>
            <li>Smooth, but starts out with a rather \\&quot;loud\\&quot; opening.</li>
            <li>But the imaginative part, and really the reason to buy the fragrance, is the pairing of this lavender with cocoa.</li>
            <li>The scent is well formulated, smooth, and quite rich.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>wearing this and Eau sauvage for good amount of time to witness that it&#x27;s a great and subtle scent, not in your face like.&lt;br /&gt;More</li>
            <li>Smells like the original.</li>
            <li>I asked at the men&#x27;s fragrance counter at Nordstrom&#x27;s where it was originally purchased and they said they didn&#x27;t carry it anymore, and it may not be manufactured anymore.  </li>
            <li>Rich stuff though.</li>
            <li>However, for in door and higher class use, there is none better in this price range.</li>
            <li>Taking its place is a clean, rich lavender.</li>
            <li>While there are many lavender scents on the market, this is a very high quality lavender.</li>
            <li>when I&#x27;m wearing it get several compliments on how good I smell.</li>
            <li>Everthing it&#x27;s ok , arrive just in time in my local, the package don&#x27;t have any troubble and the price is so cheap for that reason a buy more</li>
            <li>But not a bad thing.</li>
            <li>This one smelled fresh and clean without smelling too soapy or flowery.</li>
            <li>Not that some ladies couldn&#x27;t love this on you, because women do love memories, only this memory may be of applying makeup.  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried it the woman really enjoyed smelling me stating, &amp;#34;you smell REALLY good&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Right?</li>
            <li>Dior Homme is less popular than its flanker, Dior Homme Intense, but is, in my view, the better fragrance.</li>
            <li>It starts with very strong iris that is reminiscent of the scent used in makeup and lipstick.</li>
            <li>Nothing Dior makes is really \\&quot;cheap\\&quot;, and this holds true for Dior Homme.</li>
            <li>After reading several review pages this one was consistently on the top 10 list, but rarely #1.  </li>
            <li>Very very dense fragrance.</li>
            <li>Seller was able to deliver to africa since the package was priority shipped and above all insured.</li>
            <li>Just a solid compliment-getter, for sure.</li>
            <li>Stays with you very well!</li>
            <li>Based on that, I bought this - my first fragrance in years.</li>
            <li>Try it first.</li>
            <li>This is my current favorite.  </li>
            <li>(I imagine [[ASIN:B001SK2FEU Dior Homme Intense]] to be much more dark and smooth).</li>
            <li>Many compliments over the years from wearing this cologne, but it&#x27;s always only when they get real close...  </li>
            <li>I just love the smell of the cologne and it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>After the fragrance dries down, it comes into its own.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a gourmand fragrance, the cocoa is very much in the background, but it definitely colors the lavender to make for a unique experience.</li>
            <li>Quite strong at first, it takes at least an hour before the high note (reminds me mostly of cinnamon)</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Intense of course).</li>
            <li>This a gift for my husband, he  likes so much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mature, but exotic enough to be racy.</li>
            <li>The notes: mainly amber and cacao; I don&#x27;t get much of that iris/\\&quot;lipstick\\&quot;-vibe</li>
            <li>becomes a softer (more bearable), slightly musky, spice.</li>
            <li>Smells like something a lot older than I would wear.</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, the perfume snobs tell me the most recent reformulation (mine) is the closest to earlier versions.</li>
            <li>If you have ever smelled the interior of an older ladies purse, you know this scent.</li>
            <li>Is not a fragrance for the night because its smell is not so high and deeper for party nights, however it could be used for it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend  this fragrance.</li>
            <li>I said that it was a new cologne and why would it be deleted from manufacturing.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve smelled the new scent.</li>
            <li>I prefer use it for casual occasions when a kinda sweet smell is appropriate...</li>
            <li>Amazon said no returns due to special packaging or something.</li>
            <li>Your advertised picture shows the silver stem original formulation; but i received the black stem 2011 reformulation.  </li>
            <li>The result is a earthy, woody, and spicy concoction that is mature, but don&#x27;t worry--</li>
            <li>Personally, I&#x27;d rather not wear it much; I prefer something fresher.    </li>
            <li>As a young woman I can tell you</li>
            <li>For me, this was far too feminine to even consider.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve been snatching up as much of this as possible.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about the smell, thought it would be more like Casual Friday but still in my rotation and not over powering.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not smelled the original, but my understanding is that there is little difference between the two.</li>
            <li>Dior Homme is one that actually did not suffer (too much) after several reformulations.</li>
            <li>Unlike those scents, the iris here is more subtle and it changes rapidly after the initial spray.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended fragrance, lasts a long time doesn&#x27;t fade like others.</li>
            <li>(generally, my recommendation for this stuff: one to the chest and one to the wrist--you don&#x27;t need to spray both, just touch the wrists together; your ears too, if you like, touch them).</li>

            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend  this fragrance.</li>
            <li> I said that it was a new cologne and why would it be deleted from manufacturing.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve smelled the new scent.</li>
            <li> I prefer use it for casual occasions when a kinda sweet smell is appropriate...</li>
            <li> Amazon said no returns due to special packaging or something.</li>
            <li> Your advertised picture shows the silver stem original formulation; but i received the black stem 2011 reformulation.  </li>
            <li> The result is a earthy, woody, and spicy concoction that is mature, but don&#x27;t worry--</li>
            <li> Personally, I&#x27;d rather not wear it much; I prefer something fresher.    </li>
            <li> As a young woman I can tell you</li>
            <li> For me, this was far too feminine to even consider.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve been snatching up as much of this as possible.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the smell, thought it would be more like Casual Friday but still in my rotation and not over powering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not smelled the original, but my understanding is that there is little difference between the two.</li>
            <li> Dior Homme is one that actually did not suffer (too much) after several reformulations.</li>
            <li> Unlike those scents, the iris here is more subtle and it changes rapidly after the initial spray.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended fragrance, lasts a long time doesn&#x27;t fade like others.</li>
            <li> (generally, my recommendation for this stuff: one to the chest and one to the wrist--you don&#x27;t need to spray both, just touch the wrists together; your ears too, if you like, touch them).</li>
            <li> Sent the NEW VERSION with BLACK stem, NOT THIS VERSION with silver stem.</li>
            <li> a much older - and dirtier! :\ - man would wear...</li>
            <li> Long lasting essence, and my wife loves it too.</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t blind buy this, it isn&#x27;t cheap enough to do so.</li>
            <li> : This is not a masculine cologne.</li>
            <li> Amazon and Scentiments are a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> Try something: have someone spray it on, wait a few hours, have them walk by you, in the opposite direction, and sniff the air.</li>
            <li> no thanks.</li>
            <li> Not very feminine at all, but it was a thicker smell.</li>
            <li> that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s an old man&#x27;s cologne.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a very long time on my skin and has average projection.</li>
            <li> hints of Iris appear during dry down.  </li>
            <li> But seriously, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Rather spicy and sharp for my taste.</li>
            <li> I smell other guys&#x27; cologne and think, &amp;</li>
            <li> Also, came in a dark tinted color. . .</li>
            <li> wish it were the real deal, but unfortunately the one I got is not.</li>
            <li> As new male era colognes go it&#x27;s comfortably numb in the hairy chested man category.&lt;br</li>
            <li> 1.7oz (50mL) or less--</li>
            <li> Black stem too.</li>
            <li> As with any scent, don&#x27;t go overboard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit expensive which is the only downside.</li>
            <li> Not suitable for \\&quot;Guy&#x27;s night\\&quot; smoking cigars and drinking beer</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I hear they&#x27;re changing the formula slightly</li>
            <li> Powdery and subtle.  </li>
            <li> I tried it, compared it to one that I currently use, had my wife smell it on and off me, and we all agreed it was stale, sour, and just bad.</li>
            <li> I tried it a couple of days, had other&#x27;s smell it on and off me, and ALL agreed it was stale, sour , and just BAD.</li>
            <li> Because of the polarizing nature of the iris, this is not a safe blind buy.</li>
            <li> Not happy!</li>
            <li> I blindly bought this for my husband for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Does not project like crazy as I feared, but a close to the body scent zone.  </li>
            <li> Bad</li>
            <li> Ugly</li>
            <li> , you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one!!</li>

            <li> This product was NOT as described. I tried it a couple of days, had other&#x27;s smell it on and off me, and ALL agreed it was stale, sour , and just BAD. Amazon said no returns due to special packaging or something. So I am out $65+- for garbage !!! Not happy! I have ordered fragrances from discount online retailers like Fragrancex with great results. Amazon and Scentiments are a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> This did not smell like the bottle my fiancé had before. It seemed it had spoiled</li>
            <li> I blindly bought this for my husband for Christmas. It is really a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is actually a piece of gold, something that every man must have in their closet. Is not a fragrance for the night because its smell is not so high and deeper for party nights, however it could be used for it. It&#x27;s on your own... I prefer use it for casual occasions when a kinda sweet smell is appropriate... I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars because when I receive it the box was a damaged in one of the bottom corners, however the glass was perfect</li>
            <li> great product. Seller was able to deliver to africa since the package was priority shipped and above all insured. Smells like the original.</li>
            <li> My husband wears this and I LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> Think frankicense, cardamom, and cedar.  The result is a earthy, woody, and spicy concoction that is mature, but don&#x27;t worry--that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s an old man&#x27;s cologne.  It isn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s mature, but exotic enough to be racy.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and I love the smell!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness I love this stuff.. Can&#x27;t keep my hands off my hubbie!  Highly recommended fragrance, lasts a long time doesn&#x27;t fade like others.</li>
            <li> I am wear this perfume since I got it. It smell very good smoothly. I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I had gotten this cologne about two years ago for a Christmas present and was finally out of the product.  I asked at the men&#x27;s fragrance counter at Nordstrom&#x27;s where it was originally purchased and they said they didn&#x27;t carry it anymore, and it may not be manufactured anymore.  I said that it was a new cologne and why would it be deleted from manufacturing. They were clueless.  I tried Neiman&#x27;s and they were more helpful but did not have it either.  I knew the cologne was still being manufactured and checked with Amazon.  Eh Voila!  The rest is history.  I recieved my purchase in less than 3 days during the Christmas holiday season; very awesome.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it. Rather spicy and sharp for my taste. Smells like something a lot older than I would wear. Quite strong at first, it takes at least an hour before the high note (reminds me mostly of cinnamon) becomes a softer (more bearable), slightly musky, spice. I&#x27;ll have to see how the girls like it. Personally, I&#x27;d rather not wear it much; I prefer something fresher.    I recommend you try a smaller bottle-- 1.7oz (50mL) or less-- before committing.</li>
            <li> Long lasting essence, and my wife loves it too. Great responses from people around me who ask, &amp;#34;What cologne are you wearing?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love every Dior product and this is one more on the list</li>
            <li> This product was NOT as described. I tried it, compared it to one that I currently use, had my wife smell it on and off me, and we all agreed it was stale, sour, and just bad.</li>
            <li> Very very dense fragrance. Smooth, but starts out with a rather \\&quot;loud\\&quot; opening. Rich stuff though. Can cause headaches. Use sparingly. The balance is exquisite. The blend: very unique (you&#x27;re not going to smell anything else like it--except for Dior Homme Intense of course). But seriously, a little goes a long way (generally, my recommendation for this stuff: one to the chest and one to the wrist--you don&#x27;t need to spray both, just touch the wrists together; your ears too, if you like, touch them). Don&#x27;t overdo it in the summer--if you plan on wearing this fragrance during the summer. Yes, part of the beauty of Dior Homme is its versatility. You can wear this fragrance anytime, anywhere. But wear it at night and you become \\&quot;amazing\\&quot;. The notes: mainly amber and cacao; I don&#x27;t get much of that iris/\\&quot;lipstick\\&quot;-vibe everyone&#x27;s talking about. That&#x27;s something more from the original formulation, circa 2005. I checked my batch code: it&#x27;s from June 2013. So, reformulation for sure. Black stem too. But not a bad thing. I did my research. Dior Homme is one that actually did not suffer (too much) after several reformulations. As a matter of fact, the perfume snobs tell me the most recent reformulation (mine) is the closest to earlier versions. So good. Right? This fragrance screams of class and Paris and french perfumes and Jude Law and Robert Pattison and tuxedos and super-model women and fashion and high-class. Just a solid compliment-getter, for sure. Smells very different up close too (ie: while you are wearing it). Try something: have someone spray it on, wait a few hours, have them walk by you, in the opposite direction, and sniff the air. What you will get is this this magnificent &amp; gentle scent-bubble of pure bliss (&amp; envy). You&#x27;ll get your compliments. I guarantee it. (I imagine [[ASIN:B001SK2FEU Dior Homme Intense]] to be much more dark and smooth). Works best on textiles though. Depending on your skin, you can get maybe 7-12 hours. Your tux? Go ahead and spray that! Just don&#x27;t overdo it.! Just don&#x27;t overdo it.</li>
            <li> Best Eau de toilette to charm the ladies.&lt;br /&gt;Been wearing this and Eau sauvage for good amount of time to witness that it&#x27;s a great and subtle scent, not in your face like.&lt;br /&gt;More of a &amp;#34;if you come close enough you will be taken under my spell&amp;#34; type.&lt;br /&gt;Buy the deodorant and you are in. Whatever you do. In.</li>
            <li> A great scent, I love it and when I&#x27;m wearing it get several compliments on how good I smell. YES!</li>
            <li> This is  one of the best available colognes for men anywhere at any price. I just love the smell of the cologne and it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is the MOST sensuous fragrance I&#x27;ve ever smelled!! Stays with you very well!</li>
            <li> This a gift for my husband, he  likes so much and I like too.My grandson also has been using  for years since the stores began distributing.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t purchased cologne in years, and the last brand I bought is no longer made.  After reading several review pages this one was consistently on the top 10 list, but rarely #1.  The first time I tried it the woman really enjoyed smelling me stating, &amp;#34;you smell REALLY good&amp;#34;.  I highly recommend this product.  As with any scent, don&#x27;t go overboard.</li>
            <li> Best smell on the planet</li>
            <li> My husband love this gift</li>
            <li> I always smell the scent ads in magazines. Based on that, I bought this - my first fragrance in years. This one smelled fresh and clean without smelling too soapy or flowery. But after getting it and wearing it for a few days, I don&#x27;t really care for it. The smell sort of makes me nauseous.</li>
            <li> This was a Christams present for my husband and he loved it!  The fragrance is very nice and I think I love it on him better than anything he&#x27;s worn in years.  It was delivered and sealed not to break which is very important.  I would definitely order from them again</li>
            <li> Dior Homme is one of my top 5 favorite men&#x27;s fragrances. I love the way this smells on my skin.  It&#x27;s a bit expensive which is the only downside.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, smell like a winner.</li>
            <li> Absolutely gorgeous fragrance. It lasts a very long time on my skin and has average projection. The best part of this fragrance is the drydown when my skin starts getting a little more oily at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> The product is really awesome, match all the expectations. It&#x27;s a quality fragrance, a fantastic buy! I recommend for all.</li>
            <li> Smells great!!!! He loves it and a great price. I highly recommend  this fragrance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s close to a perfectly crafted fragrance. This scent is built around lavender, iris, and cocoa. The opening drives some people nuts. It starts with very strong iris that is reminiscent of the scent used in makeup and lipstick. Unlike those scents, the iris here is more subtle and it changes rapidly after the initial spray. I rather like the smell, but I can see how it would not appeal to everyone. After the fragrance dries down, it comes into its own. The iris is pushed to the sideline, though it is still noticeable. Taking its place is a clean, rich lavender. While there are many lavender scents on the market, this is a very high quality lavender. But the imaginative part, and really the reason to buy the fragrance, is the pairing of this lavender with cocoa. This gives the lavender a sweetness and a depth that is unusual and excellent. It&#x27;s not a gourmand fragrance, the cocoa is very much in the background, but it definitely colors the lavender to make for a unique experience. Dior Homme projects well throughout its 6-7 hour lifespan. Note: Because of the polarizing nature of the iris, this is not a safe blind buy. Try it first. It is interesting to compare it to La Nuit, by YSL. Both are lavender based but where La Nuit relies on spicy cardamom to set off the lavender, Dior Homme goes in a softer direction. Dior Homme is less popular than its flanker, Dior Homme Intense, but is, in my view, the better fragrance. The version on sale at O.co is the reformulation. I&#x27;ve not smelled the original, but my understanding is that there is little difference between the two. In any event, this version is a first-rate fragrance.</li>
            <li> As a young woman I can tell you I&#x27;d never want my man to wear this, it smells like cigarette smoke and also smells like something a much older - and dirtier! :\ - man would wear... no thanks.</li>
            <li> My goodness! This is the most amazing smelling cologne I had ever smelled, if you enjoy a light yet bold smelling scent that will have the women in your office looking at you like you&#x27;re a white Bengal tiger then this is the product for you!</li>
            <li> The Good: Nothing Dior makes is really \\&quot;cheap\\&quot;, and this holds true for Dior Homme. The scent is well formulated, smooth, and quite rich.&lt;br /&gt;The Bad: This is not a masculine cologne. Rather, it is a feminine one marketed as being so unique in that Dior could market it successfully to men, despite the fact it is SO feminine.  Sure, if you are confident in your metrosexuality this will be fine for you.  It is closer to feminine on the unisex scale.&lt;br /&gt;The Ugly: There is quite a bit of iris in this EDT.  This is good if you love iris, not so good if you don&#x27;t.  What does Iris smell like?  Ladies lipstick.  If you have ever smelled the interior of an older ladies purse, you know this scent. For me, this was far too feminine to even consider.  My sister said it smelled like the feminine aisle in a dept store.  Not that some ladies couldn&#x27;t love this on you, because women do love memories, only this memory may be of applying makeup.  Personally, although I love when women love what I wear, I have to love it as well, and in this case, I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;Men who can wear this are those who love it and don&#x27;t care what others think, or those who have a strong feminine side.  Not suitable for \\&quot;Guy&#x27;s night\\&quot; smoking cigars and drinking beer (unless you want to be ribbed by your buddies).&lt;br /&gt;I can only say--try it, if you like it, buy it.  But don&#x27;t blind buy this, it isn&#x27;t cheap enough to do so.</li>
            <li> The Aroma Does not last for a 12 hours on my body.</li>
            <li> Your advertised picture shows the silver stem original formulation; but i received the black stem 2011 reformulation.  In any case, a delightful EDT.  Does not project like crazy as I feared, but a close to the body scent zone.  Sweet/gourmand opening then hints of Iris appear during dry down.  This is my current favorite.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Everthing it&#x27;s ok , arrive just in time in my local, the package don&#x27;t have any troubble and the price is so cheap for that reason a buy more</li>
            <li> This smells amazing.  My wife bought it for me after we recieved a sample in the mail. She loves it, and i get complements all the time.</li>
            <li> The product does NOT smell like Dior.  Also, came in a dark tinted color. . . wish it were the real deal, but unfortunately the one I got is not.</li>
            <li> One of the best smelling colognes ever made. Not very feminine at all, but it was a thicker smell. Probably not the best choice as a daily use cologne, especially in hot climates. However, for in door and higher class use, there is none better in this price range.</li>
            <li> My all time favorite. Unfortunately I hear they&#x27;re changing the formula slightly and I&#x27;ve smelled the new scent. It is different and I do not like it so I&#x27;ve been snatching up as much of this as possible.</li>
            <li> RaJuR real deep kool on the web and YOUTUBE!!!  Sent the NEW VERSION with BLACK stem, NOT THIS VERSION with silver stem.</li>
            <li> I am impressed with Amazon services and will continue ordering from them.  I was given a sample of this product in a Pharmacy in the country of Panama and liked it.  That was 5 years ago.  I ordered it recently and still like it.</li>
            <li> Great price, great scent, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one!! I got it for my boyfriend but I occasionally wear it too! yuuummm</li>
            <li> As new male era colognes go it&#x27;s comfortably numb in the hairy chested man category.&lt;br /&gt;Metro maleness move over to I&#x27;m in my red mood Angie Dickenson police woman toughness. Yea! Angie had that commercial for whatever years ago!&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s face it one can wear what they want- but do you want to saunter up to the bar or float there?</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Smells wonderful and lasts a long time.  It&#x27;s the only cologne I use that always gets a response form the people around me.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the smell, thought it would be more like Casual Friday but still in my rotation and not over powering. Wife like it, she notes that it makes me smell like a banker. I think that is good or maybe not....</li>
            <li> Powdery and subtle.  Many compliments over the years from wearing this cologne, but it&#x27;s always only when they get real close...  I smell other guys&#x27; cologne and think, &amp;#34;Wow, I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t smell like that.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I recommend excellent perfume smells good and the scent lasts 5 stars</li>
