            <li>This stuff is great.  </li>
            <li>oil is great for hair too.  </li>
            <li>I just found out about this great product called Argan oil</li>
            <li>(though oils like this do a great job for me of removing eye makeup).  </li>
            <li>Definitely a win.</li>
            <li>Great on my face and hands.</li>
            <li>My skin feels great, looks great and radiant.  </li>
            <li>GREAT for skin and hair</li>
            <li>A great oil.</li>
            <li>I know there are a lot of great benefits to using argan oil, it&#x27;s just too oily for me.</li>
            <li>and this product is great.</li>
            <li>Fell in love with this oil!!</li>
            <li>Very nice product.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product and I wish I had found it sooner!</li>
            <li>This product is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>Simply amazing product!  </li>
            <li>This oil is amazing!  </li>
            <li>To be honest it smells like manure!  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I use it as my night cream!  </li>
            <li>Excellent product with so many benefits and uses.</li>
            <li>and I am loving it!</li>
            <li>I have  always used good cosmetics, but this stuff is fantastic!!!  </li>
            <li>However... the argan oil by itself does not have a pleasant fragrance - the scent reminds me of motor oil.</li>
            <li>And because of this, the aroma can vary greatly, from neutral to a very potent earthy or nutty aroma.  </li>
            <li>Because of Acure my skin and hair are gorgeous.</li>
            <li>Smells good and makes my skin glow.  </li>
            <li>Loved this from the start.</li>
            <li>It feels good.  </li>
            <li>It seems to do a good job of moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>Good price and good product.  </li>
            <li>I have used leave in oils and pastes before and loved them... but not this one.  </li>
            <li>I am hoping this oil is good for aging skin, but can&#x27;t tell yet.</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>Smells good too.</li>
            <li>I would say to everyone that it is best if you keep it in the box to keep the light away from it.</li>
            <li>the price was really good</li>
            <li>Good price too.</li>
            <li>i thought it would smell good</li>
            <li>Good purchase.</li>
            <li>does a good job taming it.</li>
            <li>so I can use their (superior) dropper.</li>
            <li>Tried this brand and LOVED it.</li>
            <li>This Argan oil is very nice, great for keeping winter skin protected and it was a much more affordable price than some of the leading brands.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a great product, but the smellâ€¦ I didn&#x27;t like the smell the oil gave, after using it for about 2 times on my face, I stopped using it.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, works great</li>
            <li>Does a great job keeping static and fly-aways under control in winter.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month now and my skin has never looked better!</li>
            <li>Skin is noticeably softer &amp; smooth.&lt;br /&gt;You will love this item!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>and then you have smooth beautiful skin.</li>
            <li>I love this oil, it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>I really love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love the Acure brand!</li>
            <li>and I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I bought this product because it is organic... and am I ever glad I did!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>There is no comparison: the Watt brand is so much better!  </li>
            <li>I love this oil!</li>
            <li>I love this oil for your face!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love that its organic and helps keep wrinkles at bay!</li>
            <li>I would like to find one that smelled a bit more pleasant though.</li>
            <li>Amazing stuff</li>
            <li>Amazing.  </li>
            <li>It is an amazing product that I use each night before I go to bed.  </li>
            <li>This oil makes my face feel amazing.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel amazing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing product that every mommy should have.</li>
            <li>Nice oil, using it on my eczema, hair, and nails.</li>
            <li>After I apply it to my face, I&#x27;ll often put some in my hair as well - a nice &#x27;gloss&#x27; alternative.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, nicely packaged.</li>
            <li>I liked this.</li>
            <li>Absorbs into my skin nicely.  </li>
            <li>This is really nice stuff.</li>
            <li>The feel of it is really nice on your skin.</li>
            <li>Great oil, perfect for blending with essential oils</li>
            <li>Catching up on reviews.</li>
            <li>glass packaging is a nice touch and it came on time.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;dry skin, then pat w/ rose water&lt;br /&gt;massage</li>
            <li>* rose water helps the oil absorb into skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly, three days since I&#x27;ve started using it</li>
            <li>Nice product, but too smelly.</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that I&#x27;m putting good product on my face and not break out.  </li>
            <li>This is gentle and perfect!</li>
            <li>Nice packaging.</li>
            <li>The Oil is very good, and express was very efficient!</li>
            <li>After the first night it had incredibly shrunk.</li>
            <li>The new pump sprayer was an excellent idea for your product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this product - great for skin and hair!</li>
            <li>Moisturizes and nourishes your skin - love that it is organic and so healthy!</li>
            <li>The Acure certified organic Argan Oil is the most amazing thing I&#x27;ve ever put on my face.</li>
            <li>Either way, it&#x27;s misleading for Acure to label this oil as being suitable for all skin types</li>
            <li>The Argan oil works best for me when I apply it to my face, neck and chest directly after cleansing at night.</li>
            <li>I would recommend buying a good sunscreen (I use MyChelle Sunshield SPF 28, great stuff) because the argan oil is good for moisturizing only and you have to protect your skin.</li>
            <li>Best moisturizer Ive ever used on my sensitive combination skin.</li>
            <li>It absorbs into your skin flawlessly and leaves your skin feeling soft and supple and glowy.</li>
            <li>Best oil ever and love the new pump</li>
            <li>Is the best oil I have tried on my skin, it does not give you the sticky sensation but instead leave my dry skin beautiful, specially during winter time when it gets dryer.</li>
            <li>Additionally, it would certainly be more effective to consume healthy foods which already contain these beneficial ingredients.</li>
            <li>First bottle was great.</li>
            <li>Very light and non greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>Very light, non-greasy.</li>
            <li>I use it in combination with lotion as a body moisturizer and am enjoying using it.</li>
            <li>Simple has always worked best for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>LOVE ðŸ’›</li>
            <li>and I love them both.</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>This oil is simply fabulous!</li>
            <li>Love this oil for my face.</li>
            <li>I love this as a night time moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I love this argan oil.</li>
            <li>, most products break me out, and if they don&#x27;t, my skin is begging for moisture.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried jojoba oil and that was okay</li>
            <li>The smell is ok.</li>
            <li>I will buy more of this.</li>
            <li>I love Argan oil.</li>
            <li>it, you will love it.</li>
            <li>I love the oil.</li>
            <li>I love the satiny way my skin looks when using it.</li>
            <li>and I love the results.</li>
            <li>I wonder whether it is the authentic Argan oil.</li>
            <li>It absorbs evenly and my skin has never been better.</li>
            <li>so I was a bit weary about putting MORE oil on my face</li>
            <li>but I am so glad I took a risk with this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not disgusting</li>
            <li>I do love the way it feels on my skin though.</li>
            <li>Love this oil</li>
            <li>Love using this product on my face, neck and chest.  </li>
            <li>So I am rating it OK.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this stuff.</li>
            <li>This stuff does not smell particularly lovely,  it reminded me of rancid olive oil</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this argan oil for 4 days or so, and most of the issues i had is gone.</li>
            <li>Love, love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love argan oil, and have used it for years.</li>
            <li>wanted something without all the chemicals and that was more affordable.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Glad I went with this.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Goes on nice and smooth, soaks into the skin and starts healing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like putting 100 chemicals on my face like in most of the creams on the market.</li>
            <li>I did like the moisture that this oil gave me, but it also gave me way too many blackheads.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Argan oil (for my hair and skin).</li>
            <li>more reviews check out pimples and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I gave it a shot and within a week my skin got better.  </li>
            <li>This is one of those less-is-more situations, for sure.  </li>
            <li>I truly love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin smooth and helps with my rosacea too!  </li>
            <li>how smoothly it goes on... and how it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all!  </li>
            <li>and i am so glad i did</li>
            <li>Pura is currently my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love this oil, it works well for me.</li>
            <li>mostly vitamin E oil ...</li>
            <li>During the winter months there is nothing better  : )</li>
            <li>I love that this product has no added chemicals, fragrance, or silicones.</li>
            <li>I even love the smell.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle transformation, but it moisturizes my skin and makes it look a bit better.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many including Josie Maran.  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s organic.</li>
            <li>so I can put more of this on.</li>
            <li>love this as a moisturizer for under my eyes .</li>
            <li>Just a six month update - I still love the stuff.  </li>
            <li>I distribute it more fully with a detangling brush.  </li>
            <li>gives my hair a lovely shine and helps combat dryness at the ends of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I use it after I mist rose water on my skin,while its still wet,for deeper penetration,it makes my skin silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>I use this oil every day all over my face as serum in winter and in summer more under eyes as cream.</li>
            <li>The oil soaks in the skin and makes the skin more supple.</li>
            <li>Bio Oil is a much better option to keep your skin hydrated.</li>
            <li>I love Argan Oil and had been using Josie Maran&#x27;s Argan Oil.  </li>
            <li>It makes my face feel and look more youthful.  </li>
            <li>I love this oil and.  </li>
            <li>The best part about this oil is that it&#x27;s light and fragrance free, making it a great oil to use with other oils - I use it with lavender to put on my face and neck.</li>
            <li>I feel soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li>If my face is particularly dry, I put the argan oil under my face cream - best!</li>
            <li>Sure, it doesn&#x27;t smell like strawberries, but it&#x27;s not too strong and goes away after you put it on.</li>
            <li>I have found the product to be excellent on my face and hands for eliminating dry skin.</li>
            <li>It feels nice on my face and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>Especially good for people who get dry skin in the winter like I do.</li>
            <li>It was especially nice in the winter when the dry air can affect your skin.  </li>
            <li>I also break out very easily and heavy creams are not the best for my skin type.</li>
            <li>Acure is a great line for people who want cruelty free, organic, and effective facial products.</li>
            <li>A great oil, but completely crappy dispensing mechanism.</li>
            <li>No, they don&#x27;t produce miracles but they are far the most gentle on my skin with the best results.</li>
            <li>okay, my soles are becoming smooth</li>
            <li>And, when I do bother to put on make up, it goes on so smooth and lovely</li>
            <li>Pure argan oil  absorbs quickly into the skin and provides great benefits.  </li>
            <li>For the price that cosmetic companies establish for their argan oil and considering that all argan oils are marked as pure 100% argan, this one is the best quality at the lowest price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried 3 other brands and Acure is the best.</li>
            <li>I used some if this at my best friend&#x27;s house after hearing other friends rave about it.  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>However, the oil from this company had a strong manure smell.</li>
            <li>I even had a friend in high school tactfully suggest that I use conditioner (I was faithfully using conditioner, but it didn&#x27;t seem to do much good).  </li>
            <li>I also use an oil-free primer that has sunscreen, for an extra layer of protection (for oily skin, I would recommend Hourglass Veil Mineral Primer, it makes your skin feel silky smooth and helps against oil buildup).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great product but make sure to use sunscreen over this.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect that it would work for dark circles, but I&#x27;ve been a wonderful improvement.  </li>
            <li>When first applied, it felt nice...</li>
            <li>Hands down, the best skin health investment I have ever made.</li>
            <li>Absolutely pure, fantastic argan oil!!</li>
            <li>Reduces fine lines, adds clarity.</li>
            <li>your make up will stay on just fine.  </li>
            <li>It seems to reduce the fine lines .</li>
            <li>I love that this oil absorbs so quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m new to argan oil &amp; wow is this oil awesome!  </li>
            <li>I blow dry and straighten my hair almost every day, and this oil does a great job keeping my hair looking and feeling healthy.  </li>
            <li>A little too oily, but works perfectly for moisture.</li>
            <li>I can see a HUGE improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>No replacement was available.</li>
            <li>Her skin was so smooth I decided to try it myself.</li>
            <li>Absorbs without being greasy and leaves the cuticle smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face overnight, primarily.</li>
            <li>True, I use a salicylic wash, and Retin A at night (which is my routine for the past 10 years), but as a moisturizer, this works wonderfully :)</li>
            <li>I use this on my face daily and it works great.</li>
            <li>My skin is so velvety and free of breakouts.</li>
            <li>Fabulous stuff.</li>
            <li>but I use it every night or when I go make up free.</li>
            <li>After applying it to my face at nights you wake up to smooth looking skin.</li>
            <li>this product is really light and hydrating.</li>
            <li>That said, I cannot stress enough how great Argan oil is for moisturizing and does not break me out.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t buy oils in plastic anymore: it shows cheap production and a lack of concern for oil</li>
            <li>No annoying smell either.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, fabulous stuff.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for several years, great stuff</li>
            <li>Switched to a different manufacturer and am happy with the oil I received now.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough how great this is.</li>
            <li>So far so good...</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>It smelled old - and the oil wasn&#x27;t as good as others I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this argan oil and so far so good.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>it is a ok product, make&#x27;s my face breakout and does not seem to help with wrinkles, but is good for dry skin.</li>
            <li>I rarely have to wear foundation because my completion improved!</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t noticed a significant difference in appearance, but she did, so</li>
            <li>Originally I used this brand of argan firming serum (with added beneficial oils).</li>
            <li>This is a really great face oil, very non-irritating, sinks in, imparts a nice glow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this is rotten.</li>
            <li>I love this oil, I&#x27;ve tried other Argan oil and this one by far is the best!!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, in regards to cost, one of our commitments as a company is to provide not only safe &amp; effective products, but products that are affordable to the consumer.  </li>

            <li>I am in love with this oil my face and hands are really soft and my skin tone is much better</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>my face feels soft, moisturised and is definitely more even-toned now which matters the most to me.</li>
            <li>great find for dry skin an hair</li>
            <li>With the very first use, I saw a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>oil is a much better price than your average moisturizer, and it is much more effective.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff; I really have seen a significant improvement in my skinâ€™s dryness and lines.</li>
            <li>and this seems to be the best oil and does not cost as much as some of the other oils.</li>
            <li>there nothing special about it.</li>
            <li>and this is a nice, clean and natural smell.</li>
            <li>Love this oil and its price; very high quality oil.</li>
            <li>Nothing has given me that glowing healthy look that I experienced when using this oil in the past.  </li>
            <li>I would discourage purchasing this again unless a fresh replacement was made available to me.</li>
            <li>Need to appy it for a longer period of time before I can make a true assessment.</li>
            <li>I use a drop or two at night and in the am,  in  moisturizer,  daily and have seen  good  </li>
            <li>I had a co-worker ask last week if I&#x27;d changed my skin routine because my skin looked really good.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this.  </li>
            <li>I really love this oily, I don&#x27;t really know what it does...</li>
            <li>I am sure my skin is much healthier for this product.</li>
            <li>It is so important to look at the chemicals and toxins that you are putting on/in your body as they are absorbed into the skin hence into the blood stream.  </li>
            <li>I suffer from acne scars and the beautiful dark circles under my eyes ( 3kids)</li>
            <li>I have read good things about argan oil, but I had yet to purchase it since I didn&#x27;t think I had a specific need.  </li>
            <li>so will probably return for a full refund and stick to Josie.</li>
            <li>I have rosacea, and this oil does not badly affect this condition.  </li>
            <li>A good alternative for someone looking for a facial moisturizer that is not chalk full of chemicals.</li>
            <li>Good thing I live with my brother and cats--the smell fades after two minutes and they don&#x27;t really care.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works perfect on my winter dry 41 year old skin and wrinkles too.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not oily or greasy and it soaks right into the skin leaving it feeling smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>I have been having issues with feeling super dryness and even raw/burning around my eyes and under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>24 F w/ mild acne scars/redness.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Luckily the smell dissipates quickly</li>
            <li>leaving this as a 1 star review since I read only 1 star and 5 star, never 3, and I think it&#x27;s useful to know what it&#x27;s good for and</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and does not leave an oily feel on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I was really impressed by Acure Organics, I&#x27;ll definetly be buying it again in the future my bottle seems to be lasting quite awhile.</li>
            <li>Not greasy or oily; absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I have been loyal to Josie Maran Argan oil for quite a while, but its price has me searching for some cheaper alternatives.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and does not leave skin feeling oily.</li>
            <li>Not greasy, super moisturize.</li>
            <li>It also disappears quickly, I smell it when I apply it</li>
            <li>Super duper bummed.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to the results after several months usage and this wonderful product will definitely be a permanent part of my skin care regime.</li>
            <li>People have to understand that the more chemicals you gonna use the older</li>
            <li>Just about four drops on my face at night after a very gentle cleanser, and my skin is fantastic 24 hours a day.</li>
            <li>IS A WINNING COMPANY FOR ITS NATURAL PRODUCTS!!</li>
            <li>will add that the smell goes away pretty quickly which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used Argan oil, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>I also believe Acure released  this oil infused with different scents along with the original (Rose, Citrus and Coconut)</li>
            <li>I do not understand why you would choose to pay for expense face lotions when a few drops of this oil massaged into skin nightly is all you&#x27;ll ever need for beautiful skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different argan oils before including a batch my old boss brought back from Israel (that was the best).</li>
            <li>It is good with my husbands dry cracked hands.</li>
            <li>This is the second bottle of this oil, it is fabulous!!</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin healthy looking and soft!</li>
            <li>I actually put it on dry hair (just the length, not the roots, though you will have to experiment to determine what method of application works best for you).  </li>
            <li>More of a natural earthy smell, not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>I love it so much I&#x27;d pay a lot more for it, but glad the price is much less now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any break-outs and my skin seems a little smoother.</li>
            <li>No chemicals, nothing unnatural, just 100% organic argan oil that has managed to erase fine lines and leave my skin feeling soft and smooth, not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a really great, totally natural moisturizer to keep your skin balanced all day long (and help with blemishes and tone), order this product right now!</li>
            <li>The lines on my face haven&#x27;t really faded yet, but my face feels fantastic.</li>
            <li>I even put it on my eczema to calm it.  </li>
            <li>argan oil thought it was worth trying.  </li>
            <li>The oil I received was fresh and arrived promptly.</li>
            <li>I have spent lots of money of good quality moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>good product  work as expected</li>
            <li>Love it for my mature skin.  </li>
            <li>Will buy again and its useful.  </li>
            <li>A friend of mine recommended it after learning that I used a cheap Target facial moisturizer and my goodness I am so glad I switched over.</li>
            <li>the results are glowing golden skin.  </li>
            <li>honestly can&#x27;t say anything about how well it works because I just can&#x27;t stand the smell enough to put it on my face or hair.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>They are worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is odorless and fast absorbing.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the natural properties of Argan oil.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out (in spite of the fact that I have a sensitive complexion), so if I can find a use for it, I will gladly add it to my line-up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update if I have any success with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my favorite oil thus far.  </li>
            <li>I am 68 years old and if the oil can make my face look more youthful everyone of all ages should use it.  </li>
            <li>The consistency is perfect in that it is not too thin, and rubs right into the skin.</li>
            <li>I had to buy another bottle because she used the first one so quickly.  </li>
            <li>Now that its getting colder, I use a little more, but its still soaking in quickly and my makeup wears well over top.  </li>
            <li>It smells rancid and went right into the trash.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t seem right putting oil on it.  </li>
            <li>This is not oily on skin but settles right in.  </li>
            <li>So now, in order to solve this problem, every time I use it, I have to unscrew the frickin&#x27; top, and use the plastic hose part of the top that extends down into the oil, to wipe the oil on my skin.</li>
            <li>Refinery29 did an entire blog on the best beauty products a few months back, which is where I discovered this AMAZING skincare gem.</li>
            <li>gave it four stars because of the smell,  which obviously makes it a less than perfect product.</li>
            <li>This is the first product I have tried from their line and given the success I will try</li>
            <li>I add a few drops to my moisturizer at night and my skin looks and feels amazing!</li>
            <li>Great product I usually buy it from mothers.  </li>
            <li>, just didn&#x27;t leave the nice moisturizing effect for long, like argan does.</li>
            <li>I use this right after the acure facial cleanser for combo to oily skin, these are the only two products I have been using and my skin is looking great.</li>
            <li>I sometimes take a tiny drop, rub it in my hands, and run it through my (very fine, color treated, split end prone) hair after a wash.</li>
            <li>(I never got many anyway, but still), and my skin seems to be a little more even in terms of tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Using anti-blemish products of any kind can often leave your skin dry and irritated.  </li>
            <li>The item came fairly quickly but really seemed lacking in the quality area.</li>
            <li>I have normal skin that can get slightly oily during the day so this routine is working great for this time of year.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product very highly!</li>
            <li>Great - especially for the prove .recommend as I&#x27;ve bought facial oils for $60 and they are only slightly better.</li>
            <li>Within 24 hours I noticed the inflammation in my skin completely decrease, acne scars began to fade, fine lines disappeared.  </li>
            <li>I used to use so many products to try to balance sensitive skin, then oily skin, then dry skin, and most of the time</li>
            <li>so I have no doubts that it&#x27;s fresh and pure.</li>
            <li>After using it for only couple of weeks I could see more evenness in my skin tone.</li>
            <li>My first time with this oil.</li>
            <li>it arrived fast!</li>
            <li>Been using this a couple weeks now, and my skin feels smooth and soft</li>
            <li>Leaves it soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This has happened to me many times, but I&#x27;ve learned to use the back of my hand to wipe off excess oil there before combing my bangs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you use a small pea amount it will absorb into your skin without the oily look, but if you use more of a dime size amount then it will mostly sit on the skin for a while.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I bought Argan oil and this literally smells like diarrhea.</li>
            <li>My first time purchasing.</li>
            <li>this one spells different from the authentic one.</li>
            <li>My husband said that I look like a girl from the Robert Palmer video and kept singing the lyrics to &amp;#34;addicted to love.&amp;#34; Funny, but</li>
            <li>I love their products, will buy shampoo and condish next.</li>
            <li>I never write reviews because lez be real, ain&#x27;t nobody got time for that!</li>
            <li>Now, granted I have pretty oily, acne-prone skin</li>
            <li>Argan oil absorbs pretty well into your skin and it didn&#x27;t make me break out at all.</li>
            <li>I am sure this product should not have such a nauseating smells.</li>
            <li>Smells kinda funny at first but goes away after applied.</li>
            <li>Instead I see better skin tone and my pores appear smaller.  </li>
            <li>I discovered after some research that argan oil should never be packaged in a clear bottle because light can make it deteriorate.</li>
            <li>It might be stored in a hot place and the oil has changed.</li>
            <li>True Argan oil, has a light nutty fragrance and the label should only have 100% Argan Oil on the ingredients.</li>
            <li>In short, I love it</li>
            <li>Many women I talk to express the same fears about trying Argan oil.</li>
            <li>and I most definitely was going out on a limb trying it.</li>
            <li>This one is supposed to be used on the skin, but it stays very greasy and does not get absorbed, like the Watt does.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t love about it (which made me hover over that 4-star rating) is that is seems to bother my eyes a bit.</li>
            <li>my oil has no smell and actually smells lovely........</li>
            <li>I have used argan oil for years,however the first time I have used this brand  </li>
            <li>it absorbs quick and leaves a soft, fresh glow.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is also important to know that although our oils are housed in clear bottles so that you can enjoy the beautiful color of the oils, they are UV etched, meaning they are indeed protected from UV light, which can ultimately cause a breakdown of the essential fatty acids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>NOT ALL ARGAN OILS ARE CREATED EQUALLY, and this is pure, top grade stuff.</li>
            <li>I use it in combination with other products and it has done amazingly well.</li>
            <li>I just want health skin that is soft and if the product hides a few fine lines - all the better!  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical about putting straight oil onto my oily face, but this is a wonderful product.  </li>
            <li>It does smell a bit strange, but it isn&#x27;t strong and dissipates once it has been absorbed.</li>
            <li>a little goes along way blown away by how fast I received it very very pleased</li>
            <li>So obviously, wanting to treat my skin better, I decided to research more simple, organic, natural, and healthier ways to moisturize my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin looks more vibrant and I have no dry skin (and we live at 7,000 feet!)</li>
            <li>That combo has made my skin super soft, and supple.</li>
            <li>Also it seems less effective as the 1st bottle I bought from store.  </li>
            <li>I pop this on my finger, 1 drop in the morning and 2 drops in the night, rub them, and apply it around my nose and the mouth &amp; between eyebrows as they tend to get most dry.</li>
            <li>Pure and organic.</li>
            <li>Then I ordered just the pure argan oil.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s pure.  </li>
            <li>This product is pure argan oil;</li>
            <li>adult acne (which I&#x27;ve had constantly for the past 12 years) is gone and my skin is perfectly balanced.  </li>
            <li>I have combination skin, and thought it might leave the oilier spots too oily, but it&#x27;s effectively saturated the dry and oilier spots evenly--making my whole face soft and blemish free.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This facial oil helps to decrease fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It worked fine, but as it starting to get warmer my skin oilier.</li>
            <li>But this product is scentless, and is of very high quality.</li>
            <li>My skin has filled fine lines in and my sunspots have almost disappeared(I had some very dark ones).  </li>
            <li>, i use many pure oils on my face but this one has topped them all, my skin feels like silk and my pores looks smaller, it gives me that dewy glow that im always trying to achieve naturally.</li>
            <li>and I always got real argan oil.</li>
            <li>I was really upset I paid for it.</li>
            <li>My skin feels moisturized and much softer.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!  </li>
            <li>It thins your skin and you have to be a lot more careful about sun-exposure, etc.</li>
            <li>A bottle can often go for $17 at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>But surprisingly enough it is light and absorbs well.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is absolutely</li>
            <li>really helps with acne.</li>
            <li>and this stuff really helps.</li>
            <li>I switched to this from the Emu oil since the Emu oil wasn&#x27;t doing much for my skin anymore, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li>Really.</li>
            <li>This smell is really distracting and makes me not want to use the product.</li>
            <li>I bought this from a Whole Foods store, so not Amazon this time.</li>
            <li>I have very oily acne prone skin</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I used to buy this from Whole Foods but for convenience, I bought it online this time.  </li>
            <li>This soaks in very well</li>
            <li>Very well priced.</li>
            <li>Perfect for keeping your skin moisturized in this freezing cold weather.</li>
            <li>What else could one ask for, really.</li>
            <li>I put this on my face and really like that it absorbs in and is not greasy and</li>
            <li>This is the real deal, 100% argan oil.</li>
            <li>I can really get on board with an organic/natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It really gives me a glow when I wake in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I used to have very oily skin...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>1 bottle lasts me a whole season.</li>
            <li>Non-greasy and doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell.</li>
            <li>Pump it gently though to avoid it squirting</li>
            <li>This is no miracle cure, and it does take some time to see any result, but if I run out of it, I can tell after a week or so that I really need to buy more.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable, also.</li>
            <li>This is very affordable for argan oil.  </li>
            <li>It really soothes and moisturizes your skin.  </li>
            <li>If I could I would buy this for my whole body</li>
            <li>I bought mine at Whole foods.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t justify paying twice as much for Josie Maran&#x27;s oil even though I don&#x27;t like the smell of this one.</li>
            <li>any kind that is 100% organic argan oil and there are quite a few out there.  </li>
            <li>All I use now is Simple Micellar water to cleanse, Acure&#x27;s Rose &amp; Red Tea Toner, and this powerhouse oil to seal in moisture.</li>
            <li>Given that I cannot ascertain any meaningful difference between the two, I&#x27;ll be buying this oil in the near future.</li>
            <li>I am pregnant and my skin has been super dry.</li>
            <li>If you use just the right amount, then the results are silky, non-frizzy hair without the help of a professional stylist.  </li>
            <li>: When using, make sure the bottle is straight upright and catch the bursts in your other hand.</li>
            <li>And for those who cannot wait for results, it makes your skin very soft after first application.</li>
            <li>If you tried the other brands, try Acure, it&#x27;s so much better.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair healthy, shinny without any other products.</li>
            <li>I purchased it to use as a moisturizer but have enjoyed other benefits as well.</li>
            <li>I was excited to use this initially because of the price point and it was USDA organic.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this and will be repurchasing again from this seller if possible, shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li>I live in CO where the air is very dry and skin shrivels up pretty easily, so for people in my area, this is a must have.  </li>
            <li>Logic tells me that while it may have good properties for treating such a condition (EFA&#x27;s and vitamin E, etc.), if skin is still dry shortly after use, this increases the likely hood of fine lines, thus being counter-intuitive.</li>
            <li>It is easily absorbable and has no particular smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was also worried by negative reviews I saw, so I wrote to Acure to see what they&#x27;d say in response to the most common issues I saw reviewers had: the cost (too cheap for what it is), bottling (clear bottle not an effective way to protect the product), manufacturing (is this pure oil, or does it go through a chemical process), and smell (doesn&#x27;t smell nutty like Argan oil is supposed</li>
            <li>Makes skin smooth, helps to dry skin.</li>
            <li>I like how it helps smooth out my dry skin.</li>
            <li>pm, it aborbs well and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy (with all oils less is more, I use one pump).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that quality Argan oil is always sold in darker bottles to maintain the integrity of the products, but I&#x27;m sure those brands are probably more expensive.</li>
            <li>I use mainly around my eyes but also spread to the rest of my face and in areas that are damaged from sun.  </li>
            <li>As far as a wrinkle-fighting oil, I can&#x27;t really comment on that since I don&#x27;t really have that problem....</li>
            <li>I originally bought this product to use on the ends of my long stick-thin hair, but upon doing some research, I decided to try it on my skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this prodcut</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I am on my first bottle of this and will be buying a second when I run out, which is saying a lot because I usually don&#x27;t re-purchase face products for moisturizing as I haven&#x27;t found anything I loved and that didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and I certainly would not recommend it for sensitive skins.</li>
            <li>Not sure what I can describe it as, just to say that I am very easily offended by smells,</li>
            <li>Spend a little more on another brand</li>
            <li>That worked a little better, but not much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is important because when undergoing heat processing (commonly when processed by machinery) most of the precious essential fatty acids and vitamin E are lost.  </li>
            <li>Really makes hair soft, feels healthier.  </li>
            <li>my heels feel real soft.</li>
            <li>My skin type is combination, very prone to acne and sensitive to chemical.</li>
            <li>my mature skin is much smoother, tighter, and lines are diminishing.  </li>
            <li>My scars appear less dramatic and I have received so many compliments on how good my complexion</li>
            <li>I used my moms for a few days and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I follow with a normal moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m left with glowing, fresh- looking skin that belies my age.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, like all the Acure Organics products I have tired.</li>
            <li>I have had argan oil from other companies and it smelled fine.</li>
            <li>I had a bottle of Acure Organics Argan Facial Oil in my cupboard that I actually bought for my hair but was too scared to use it on my face since I breakout so easily.</li>
            <li>I also find it works well in hair to tame frizz, but don&#x27;t use too much...certainly better than silicone-based serums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This argan oil is fine for the price, but I find that it does not absorb as well as Josie Maran (which is more expensive) and sits atop the skin.</li>
            <li>She wanted me to test out a new product (EpiDuo) which is a retinol with benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li>ever since i moved to new york</li>
            <li>I picked up this line at a health food store in upstate New York.</li>
            <li>And be on the lookout for the launch of our new site that will have treatment reviews, spa reviews and product reviews.</li>
            <li>See you at pimples and wrinkles!ur new site that will have treatment reviews, spa reviews and product reviews.</li>
            <li>but when I needed a new bottle they were out of it.</li>
            <li>I have definitely noticed my hair looks better, is more manageable (less frizzy), and my scalp flakes less.  </li>
            <li>know an ounce doesn&#x27;t sound like a lot, but with the dropper, and only needing about 3 drops, this will last a while, and save me lots of money!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve definitely noticed that it has decreased the scarring and redness on my face as well.&lt;br /&gt;All around a great product.</li>
            <li>Iâ€™ve tried doing it more slowly, but it doesnâ€™t help much.</li>
            <li>It seems cheap and water down, not thick at all like what some of the reviews said.  </li>
            <li>I have combination skin that is very sensitive and prone to hormonal acne along my jawline.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft and glowy.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin with pores and acne scars.  </li>
            <li>And thus, because we include argan oil in almost every single one of our formulations, we purchase the oil in such large quantities that we receive a significant discount, which in turn, is passed on to the consumer in the form of affordable pricing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>And thus, because we include argan oil in almost every single one of our formulations, we purchase the oil in such large quantities that we receive a significant discount, which in turn, is passed on to the consumer in the form of affordable pricing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t use any of my normal products which are all formulated for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>product was exactly what I needed and I haven&#x27;t looked back.</li>
            <li>I am excited to try their other products.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know if the contents are exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>I only put it on after hot showers.  </li>
            <li>I have seen slight improvement around my eyes where I had fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the Josie Maran argan oil for the past year and love it.</li>
            <li>I received my first order from this brand and it has white stuff floating around.</li>
            <li>Both are amazing on the skin, feel silky, not greasy, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>My scars are so much less pronounced and smooth.</li>
            <li>I really like this product, but I&#x27;m not sure how to fit it in my skincare regimen.  </li>
            <li>The first bottle I purchased had no scent at all, and it was clear with a tint of yellow.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, mature skin and</li>
            <li>And the little bottle will last you for about 4 months or even more because you just need a small amount I love this product</li>
            <li>Some of the other reviews characterized it as a sweet, nutty smell, but mine smelled rancid, like rotten nuts or briny olives.</li>
            <li>I even added pure jasmine essential oil,  </li>
            <li>The scent is very light, and faintly floral, and the oil is easily absorbed.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t say there have been any dramatic changes, but I&#x27;ve noticed that my make-up is easier to apply and I&#x27;ve experienced fewer dry patches.</li>
            <li>If you are looking to avoid artificial ingredients, this argan oil is a great choice.  </li>
            <li>I want to make it clear too, that this doesn&#x27;t seem to be a problem with some sort of defectiveness in one unit, but in the fundamental way these are made.</li>
            <li>A few drops at night after cleansing are all you need for soft, smooth, glowing skin in the morning.  </li>
            <li>My skin&#x27;s never been so clear or soft.</li>
            <li>I tried the Sensitive skin face wash from Burt&#x27;s bees and this caused an allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li>Sensitive skin&lt;</li>
            <li>So far no complaints.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s has no preservatives or additives, it&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li>If you use too much of this product, then you can overdo it to the point where your hair will actually look oily.  </li>
            <li>However, argan oil has absolutely changed my entire routine.  </li>
            <li>I apply it directly to my skin--face, neck, hands, wherever.  </li>
            <li>and I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I bought this oil because I heard that it serves as a non-greasy, natural and organic moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This leaves your skin soft and supple not oily as I would have thought.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s just the natural scent of the oil.</li>
            <li>Even in Lake Tahoe snow it kept my face soft and the dryness at bay.</li>
            <li>so I recommend using an organic facial lotion as a carrier substance so you can adjust how much your skin can absorb.</li>
            <li>This oil is improving my skin and it feels really soft.</li>
            <li>I put a teeny tiny amount on my palm, and rub it very well into my face.  </li>
            <li>it smells like old tires or something.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Its been 2 week so far</li>
            <li>Keeps my acne at bay, tightened my skin, provided youthful glow, helped my skin look and feel young again.</li>
            <li>I replace my night cream with it once in a while and wake up with a brighter, soft and fresh-looking skin with some imperfections muted.</li>
            <li>an nearly 50 years old,</li>
            <li>So far I like this stuff</li>
            <li>Our local Whole Foods store had the 2oz Acure Argan Oil on sale for $20.24.  </li>
            <li>my 86 year old mother uses it on her face every day.  </li>
            <li>This product makes my face so soft and supple, but does not cause breakouts.</li>
            <li>The oil makes my face feel so soft, not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried some in my hair yesterday and my hair feels so soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m probably just going to start pouring this oil into my old Josie Maran bottle</li>
            <li>This one works just as well at moisturizing as the synthetic creams do, but is all natural and has added benefits.  </li>
            <li>It moisturizes, it improves the condition of your skin, hair, and scalp; and it&#x27;s all natural.  </li>
            <li>I use this to replace night time lotion and it has completely turned around my skin.</li>
            <li>This is one of the better hair oils I have used lately.  </li>
            <li>Do not put on your skin if yo have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have always dealt with adult acne prone, combo skin</li>
            <li>I am type a person who loves everything natural not chemicals or parabens.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive combination/oily skin(dark)</li>
            <li>I wake up with soft, plump skin.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is not nearly as dry (particularly in winter weather).</li>
            <li>I cut it with jojoba and rose hip oil from time to time to extend its use and to approximate a serum of sorts.</li>
            <li>In protest, I&#x27;m going to try other Argan oils to try to find BOTH an oil I love and someone who actually spent some time trying to think of the customer who is trying to use the damn bottle so they don&#x27;t wind up with oil all over the place.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it will do me better in the spring/summer after cleansing since my skin is less dry during that time of year.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s oily and dry at the same time with mild acne.</li>
            <li>, I completely went off other moisturizers to make sure it was this product and not a combination of other factors.  </li>
            <li>My face is so moisturized and the redness is the most subtle it has ever been.  </li>
            <li>While it goes on slightly oily it quickly absorbs and does not leave your skin feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>I picked up this particular brand at my local grocery and on day 4 (today) all signs of irritation are gone.  </li>
            <li>It is 100% pure and does go on thick but soaks in fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>I pump a few pumps out, rub my hands together, and then pat through my hair with a special focus on the ends.  </li>
            <li>My face feels smooth and moisturized even in the winter when its usually dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first time I put it in my wet hair before blow drying (like I always do) and it made it so oily -</li>
            <li>I wish the dropper of the Acure oil was a little more like the JM dropper though - the end is not tapered, but flat, so sometimes a drop or two extra comes out.</li>
            <li>I love the simplicity of a 1 ingredient product and hope the other purported benefits are even half true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>IT REALLY HELP DRY SKIN.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I would recommend it for someone suffering from acne, but for dry problem skin it&#x27;s been very healing and brightening.  </li>
            <li>At first it has a strange scent, but I&#x27;m starting to see</li>
            <li>29 yr old female, sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>Not sure which of the Acure products to give the most credit to: the Argan Oil, the Brightening Facial Scrub or the Facial Cleansing Creme.</li>
            <li>but I recommend trying it (for the price you really have nothing to loose)........</li>
            <li>Incredibly rich in Vitamin E, Essential Fatty Acids, and Proteins, Argan Oil is said to help fight lines, repair imperfections, minimize scars + stretch marks, restore texture, elasticity and tone, and reduce inflammation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Argan Oil is 100% pure, unrefined and unprocessed.  </li>
            <li>Please rest assured it is indeed 100% pure USDA certified organic Argan Oil, and is unrefined and unprocessed.  </li>
            <li>Please rest assured it is indeed 100% pure USDA certified organic Argan Oil, and is unrefined and unprocessed.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time ordering from Acure Organics, and while I like the oil, I&#x27;m not enjoying the particular smell it has.</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s also highly affordable compared to some more complicated hair treatments on the market.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s prob good stuff, but beware it is extremely greasy on your face , and the smell is strong and pretty horrific .</li>
            <li>My skin has been AMAZING for 8 months now, and I will never consider using an expensive product line again.  </li>
            <li>The anti-inflammatory properties of the Argan Oil have minimized break outs and if I do get a blemish it generally disappears overnight.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t really like is the smell, it&#x27;s strange, but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it, and I will continue to use it for the results it gives me.</li>
            <li>what it is that seens to be in facial cleansers even if they are natural or organic.  </li>
            <li>As an adult, I&#x27;ve had my hair highlighted here and there, but have basically left it alone.  </li>
            <li>So far it hasn&#x27;t clogged my pores, and I only use it at night along with witch hazel toner, AHA souffle, and hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li>Its the only one i have tried as far as Argan Oil</li>
            <li>Use with Acure sensitive skin facial wash.</li>
            <li>My face use to be very greasy and my pores very big, after starting to use it oil is under control and pores seem to be smaller.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and look younger after I use t the product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m taking it back and contacting Acure directly to find out why.</li>
            <li>I use it at night and also in the morning under my sheer, natural Dr. Hauschka makeup.  </li>
            <li>I am a big fan of natural products and decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li>It feels really thin and stays on top of my skin unlike the others I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am now on my second bottle, and have to say I wouldn&#x27;t want to live without it in my facial skincare routine.  </li>
            <li>My light scars have dissipated, my skin is dewy and aglow all day long, my skin tone has evened out (which was my main issue), and I hardly break out anymore.</li>
            <li>a semi-deep wrinkle on my check has decreased significantly that I actually have to really look for it to see any trace of it.  </li>
            <li>A year ago Acure sold their oil for $29, now it&#x27;s $15 other places for some reason, $15 at Whole Foods and Vitamin cottage.</li>
            <li>The body is not made for chemicals check all the people who live in different countries that dont have access  to these expensive chemical products they look better than those who does.</li>
            <li>Even though I have naturally oily/combination skin, the Argan oil actually helped to moisturize my skin while not creating extra oil.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive and dry skin with some redness.  </li>
            <li>Light or plastic bottles degrade the product and it is far too tedious of a product to make for a true company to waste with improper packaging.</li>
            <li>While it has had the same effects as Josie Maran&#x27;s Argan Oil, it has a very odd and distinct smell to it that Josie Maran&#x27;s oil does not.</li>
            <li>but this was not a good fit for us.</li>
            <li>My aesthetician recommended finding a basic organic gentle cleanser and getting rid of all other product, and then adding argan oil as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>After doing much research I decided to give Argan Oil a try, in one night it gave my skin moisture, my acne went down along with my eczema.</li>
            <li>Argan Oil, much like other crops, such as wine and cheese, does vary depending on things such as seasonality and climate.  </li>
            <li>So even without chlorinated swimming pools or peroxide highlights, my hair remained dry and damaged looking unless I had it professionally styled at a salon.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive, oily acne prone skin that gets dry, flaky from treatments.</li>
            <li>Thus far, I&#x27;ve used it on my hands which have been dry during the winter months.</li>
            <li>I hve extremely dry sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical of this stuff at first, but after researching and reading so many reviews, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I assumed that maybe I just used too much and tried it again today with much less and got the same result.</li>
            <li>It seems that most people with very thick hair also have very dry, coarse hair.  </li>
            <li>Since this is a small bottle, I carry in my handbag and rub it onto my face whenever it&#x27;s feeling super dry.</li>
            <li>It is less expensive than some other brands, but is just as effective and pure of a product.</li>
            <li>I use a very small amount after I wash my face at night &amp; in the morning, it rubs in quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This stuff is great.  </li>
            <li> oil is great for hair too.  </li>
            <li> I just found out about this great product called Argan oil</li>
            <li> (though oils like this do a great job for me of removing eye makeup).  </li>
            <li> Definitely a win.</li>
            <li> Great on my face and hands.</li>

            <li> GREAT for skin and hair</li>
            <li> A great oil.</li>
            <li> I know there are a lot of great benefits to using argan oil, it&#x27;s just too oily for me.</li>
            <li> and this product is great.</li>
            <li> Fell in love with this oil!!</li>
            <li> Very nice product.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product and I wish I had found it sooner!</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Simply amazing product!  </li>
            <li> This oil is amazing!  </li>
            <li> To be honest it smells like manure!  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I use it as my night cream!  </li>
            <li> Excellent product with so many benefits and uses.</li>
            <li> and I am loving it!</li>
            <li> I have  always used good cosmetics, but this stuff is fantastic!!!  </li>
            <li> However... the argan oil by itself does not have a pleasant fragrance - the scent reminds me of motor oil.</li>
            <li> And because of this, the aroma can vary greatly, from neutral to a very potent earthy or nutty aroma.  </li>
            <li> Because of Acure my skin and hair are gorgeous.</li>
            <li> Smells good and makes my skin glow.  </li>
            <li> Loved this from the start.</li>
            <li> It feels good.  </li>
            <li> It seems to do a good job of moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> Good price and good product.  </li>
            <li> I have used leave in oils and pastes before and loved them... but not this one.  </li>
            <li> I am hoping this oil is good for aging skin, but can&#x27;t tell yet.</li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> Smells good too.</li>
            <li> I would say to everyone that it is best if you keep it in the box to keep the light away from it.</li>
            <li> the price was really good</li>
            <li> Good price too.</li>
            <li> i thought it would smell good</li>
            <li> Good purchase.</li>
            <li> does a good job taming it.</li>
            <li> so I can use their (superior) dropper.</li>
            <li> Tried this brand and LOVED it.</li>
            <li> This Argan oil is very nice, great for keeping winter skin protected and it was a much more affordable price than some of the leading brands.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a great product, but the smellâ€¦ I didn&#x27;t like the smell the oil gave, after using it for about 2 times on my face, I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, works great</li>
            <li> Does a great job keeping static and fly-aways under control in winter.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month now and my skin has never looked better!</li>
            <li> Skin is noticeably softer &amp; smooth.&lt;br /&gt;You will love this item!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> and then you have smooth beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> I love this oil, it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love the Acure brand!</li>
            <li> and I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it is organic... and am I ever glad I did!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> There is no comparison: the Watt brand is so much better!  </li>
            <li> I love this oil!</li>
            <li> I love this oil for your face!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love that its organic and helps keep wrinkles at bay!</li>
            <li> I would like to find one that smelled a bit more pleasant though.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff</li>
            <li> Amazing.  </li>
            <li> It is an amazing product that I use each night before I go to bed.  </li>
            <li> This oil makes my face feel amazing.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel amazing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product that every mommy should have.</li>
            <li> Nice oil, using it on my eczema, hair, and nails.</li>
            <li> After I apply it to my face, I&#x27;ll often put some in my hair as well - a nice &#x27;gloss&#x27; alternative.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, nicely packaged.</li>
            <li> I liked this.</li>
            <li> Absorbs into my skin nicely.  </li>
            <li> This is really nice stuff.</li>
            <li> The feel of it is really nice on your skin.</li>
            <li> Great oil, perfect for blending with essential oils</li>
            <li> Catching up on reviews.</li>
            <li> glass packaging is a nice touch and it came on time.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;dry skin, then pat w/ rose water&lt;br /&gt;massage</li>
            <li> * rose water helps the oil absorb into skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Honestly, three days since I&#x27;ve started using it</li>
            <li> Nice product, but too smelly.</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that I&#x27;m putting good product on my face and not break out.  </li>
            <li> This is gentle and perfect!</li>
            <li> Nice packaging.</li>
            <li> The Oil is very good, and express was very efficient!</li>
            <li> After the first night it had incredibly shrunk.</li>
            <li> The new pump sprayer was an excellent idea for your product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product - great for skin and hair!</li>
            <li> Moisturizes and nourishes your skin - love that it is organic and so healthy!</li>
            <li> The Acure certified organic Argan Oil is the most amazing thing I&#x27;ve ever put on my face.</li>
            <li> Either way, it&#x27;s misleading for Acure to label this oil as being suitable for all skin types</li>
            <li> The Argan oil works best for me when I apply it to my face, neck and chest directly after cleansing at night.</li>
            <li> I would recommend buying a good sunscreen (I use MyChelle Sunshield SPF 28, great stuff) because the argan oil is good for moisturizing only and you have to protect your skin.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer Ive ever used on my sensitive combination skin.</li>
            <li> It absorbs into your skin flawlessly and leaves your skin feeling soft and supple and glowy.</li>
            <li> Best oil ever and love the new pump</li>
            <li> Is the best oil I have tried on my skin, it does not give you the sticky sensation but instead leave my dry skin beautiful, specially during winter time when it gets dryer.</li>
            <li> Additionally, it would certainly be more effective to consume healthy foods which already contain these beneficial ingredients.</li>
            <li> First bottle was great.</li>
            <li> Very light and non greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Very light, non-greasy.</li>
            <li> I use it in combination with lotion as a body moisturizer and am enjoying using it.</li>
            <li> Simple has always worked best for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> LOVE ðŸ’›</li>
            <li> and I love them both.</li>
            <li> Love</li>
            <li> This oil is simply fabulous!</li>
            <li> Love this oil for my face.</li>
            <li> I love this as a night time moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love this argan oil.</li>
            <li> , most products break me out, and if they don&#x27;t, my skin is begging for moisture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried jojoba oil and that was okay</li>
            <li> The smell is ok.</li>
            <li> I will buy more of this.</li>
            <li> I love Argan oil.</li>
            <li> it, you will love it.</li>
            <li> I love the oil.</li>
            <li> I love the satiny way my skin looks when using it.</li>
            <li> and I love the results.</li>
            <li> I wonder whether it is the authentic Argan oil.</li>
            <li> It absorbs evenly and my skin has never been better.</li>
            <li> so I was a bit weary about putting MORE oil on my face</li>
            <li> but I am so glad I took a risk with this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not disgusting</li>
            <li> I do love the way it feels on my skin though.</li>
            <li> Love this oil</li>
            <li> Love using this product on my face, neck and chest.  </li>
            <li> So I am rating it OK.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this stuff.</li>
            <li> This stuff does not smell particularly lovely,  it reminded me of rancid olive oil</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this argan oil for 4 days or so, and most of the issues i had is gone.</li>
            <li> Love, love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love argan oil, and have used it for years.</li>
            <li> wanted something without all the chemicals and that was more affordable.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Glad I went with this.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Goes on nice and smooth, soaks into the skin and starts healing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like putting 100 chemicals on my face like in most of the creams on the market.</li>
            <li> I did like the moisture that this oil gave me, but it also gave me way too many blackheads.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Argan oil (for my hair and skin).</li>
            <li> more reviews check out pimples and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I gave it a shot and within a week my skin got better.  </li>
            <li> This is one of those less-is-more situations, for sure.  </li>
            <li> I truly love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin smooth and helps with my rosacea too!  </li>
            <li> how smoothly it goes on... and how it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all!  </li>
            <li> and i am so glad i did</li>
            <li> Pura is currently my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love this oil, it works well for me.</li>
            <li> mostly vitamin E oil ...</li>
            <li> During the winter months there is nothing better  : )</li>
            <li> I love that this product has no added chemicals, fragrance, or silicones.</li>
            <li> I even love the smell.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle transformation, but it moisturizes my skin and makes it look a bit better.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many including Josie Maran.  </li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s organic.</li>
            <li> so I can put more of this on.</li>
            <li> love this as a moisturizer for under my eyes .</li>
            <li> Just a six month update - I still love the stuff.  </li>
            <li> I distribute it more fully with a detangling brush.  </li>
            <li> gives my hair a lovely shine and helps combat dryness at the ends of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I use it after I mist rose water on my skin,while its still wet,for deeper penetration,it makes my skin silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> I use this oil every day all over my face as serum in winter and in summer more under eyes as cream.</li>
            <li> The oil soaks in the skin and makes the skin more supple.</li>
            <li> Bio Oil is a much better option to keep your skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> I love Argan Oil and had been using Josie Maran&#x27;s Argan Oil.  </li>
            <li> It makes my face feel and look more youthful.  </li>
            <li> I love this oil and.  </li>
            <li> The best part about this oil is that it&#x27;s light and fragrance free, making it a great oil to use with other oils - I use it with lavender to put on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> I feel soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li> If my face is particularly dry, I put the argan oil under my face cream - best!</li>
            <li> Sure, it doesn&#x27;t smell like strawberries, but it&#x27;s not too strong and goes away after you put it on.</li>
            <li> I have found the product to be excellent on my face and hands for eliminating dry skin.</li>
            <li> It feels nice on my face and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> Especially good for people who get dry skin in the winter like I do.</li>
            <li> It was especially nice in the winter when the dry air can affect your skin.  </li>
            <li> I also break out very easily and heavy creams are not the best for my skin type.</li>
            <li> Acure is a great line for people who want cruelty free, organic, and effective facial products.</li>
            <li> A great oil, but completely crappy dispensing mechanism.</li>
            <li> No, they don&#x27;t produce miracles but they are far the most gentle on my skin with the best results.</li>
            <li> okay, my soles are becoming smooth</li>
            <li> And, when I do bother to put on make up, it goes on so smooth and lovely</li>
            <li> Pure argan oil  absorbs quickly into the skin and provides great benefits.  </li>
            <li> For the price that cosmetic companies establish for their argan oil and considering that all argan oils are marked as pure 100% argan, this one is the best quality at the lowest price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 3 other brands and Acure is the best.</li>
            <li> I used some if this at my best friend&#x27;s house after hearing other friends rave about it.  </li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> However, the oil from this company had a strong manure smell.</li>
            <li> I even had a friend in high school tactfully suggest that I use conditioner (I was faithfully using conditioner, but it didn&#x27;t seem to do much good).  </li>
            <li> I also use an oil-free primer that has sunscreen, for an extra layer of protection (for oily skin, I would recommend Hourglass Veil Mineral Primer, it makes your skin feel silky smooth and helps against oil buildup).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great product but make sure to use sunscreen over this.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect that it would work for dark circles, but I&#x27;ve been a wonderful improvement.  </li>
            <li> When first applied, it felt nice...</li>
            <li> Hands down, the best skin health investment I have ever made.</li>
            <li> Absolutely pure, fantastic argan oil!!</li>
            <li> Reduces fine lines, adds clarity.</li>
            <li> your make up will stay on just fine.  </li>
            <li> It seems to reduce the fine lines .</li>
            <li> I love that this oil absorbs so quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m new to argan oil &amp; wow is this oil awesome!  </li>
            <li> I blow dry and straighten my hair almost every day, and this oil does a great job keeping my hair looking and feeling healthy.  </li>
            <li> A little too oily, but works perfectly for moisture.</li>
            <li> I can see a HUGE improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> No replacement was available.</li>
            <li> Her skin was so smooth I decided to try it myself.</li>
            <li> Absorbs without being greasy and leaves the cuticle smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face overnight, primarily.</li>
            <li> True, I use a salicylic wash, and Retin A at night (which is my routine for the past 10 years), but as a moisturizer, this works wonderfully :)</li>
            <li> I use this on my face daily and it works great.</li>
            <li> My skin is so velvety and free of breakouts.</li>
            <li> Fabulous stuff.</li>
            <li> but I use it every night or when I go make up free.</li>
            <li> After applying it to my face at nights you wake up to smooth looking skin.</li>
            <li> this product is really light and hydrating.</li>
            <li> That said, I cannot stress enough how great Argan oil is for moisturizing and does not break me out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t buy oils in plastic anymore: it shows cheap production and a lack of concern for oil</li>
            <li> No annoying smell either.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, fabulous stuff.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for several years, great stuff</li>
            <li> Switched to a different manufacturer and am happy with the oil I received now.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough how great this is.</li>
            <li> So far so good...</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> It smelled old - and the oil wasn&#x27;t as good as others I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this argan oil and so far so good.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> it is a ok product, make&#x27;s my face breakout and does not seem to help with wrinkles, but is good for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I rarely have to wear foundation because my completion improved!</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t noticed a significant difference in appearance, but she did, so</li>
            <li> Originally I used this brand of argan firming serum (with added beneficial oils).</li>
            <li> This is a really great face oil, very non-irritating, sinks in, imparts a nice glow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this is rotten.</li>
            <li> I love this oil, I&#x27;ve tried other Argan oil and this one by far is the best!!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, in regards to cost, one of our commitments as a company is to provide not only safe &amp; effective products, but products that are affordable to the consumer.  </li>

            <li> I am in love with this oil my face and hands are really soft and my skin tone is much better</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> my face feels soft, moisturised and is definitely more even-toned now which matters the most to me.</li>
            <li> great find for dry skin an hair</li>
            <li> With the very first use, I saw a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> oil is a much better price than your average moisturizer, and it is much more effective.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff; I really have seen a significant improvement in my skinâ€™s dryness and lines.</li>
            <li> and this seems to be the best oil and does not cost as much as some of the other oils.</li>
            <li> there nothing special about it.</li>
            <li> and this is a nice, clean and natural smell.</li>
            <li> Love this oil and its price; very high quality oil.</li>
            <li> Nothing has given me that glowing healthy look that I experienced when using this oil in the past.  </li>
            <li> I would discourage purchasing this again unless a fresh replacement was made available to me.</li>
            <li> Need to appy it for a longer period of time before I can make a true assessment.</li>
            <li> I use a drop or two at night and in the am,  in  moisturizer,  daily and have seen  good  </li>
            <li> I had a co-worker ask last week if I&#x27;d changed my skin routine because my skin looked really good.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this.  </li>
            <li> I really love this oily, I don&#x27;t really know what it does...</li>
            <li> I am sure my skin is much healthier for this product.</li>
            <li> It is so important to look at the chemicals and toxins that you are putting on/in your body as they are absorbed into the skin hence into the blood stream.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from acne scars and the beautiful dark circles under my eyes ( 3kids)</li>
            <li> I have read good things about argan oil, but I had yet to purchase it since I didn&#x27;t think I had a specific need.  </li>
            <li> so will probably return for a full refund and stick to Josie.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea, and this oil does not badly affect this condition.  </li>
            <li> A good alternative for someone looking for a facial moisturizer that is not chalk full of chemicals.</li>
            <li> Good thing I live with my brother and cats--the smell fades after two minutes and they don&#x27;t really care.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works perfect on my winter dry 41 year old skin and wrinkles too.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not oily or greasy and it soaks right into the skin leaving it feeling smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> I have been having issues with feeling super dryness and even raw/burning around my eyes and under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> 24 F w/ mild acne scars/redness.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Luckily the smell dissipates quickly</li>
            <li> leaving this as a 1 star review since I read only 1 star and 5 star, never 3, and I think it&#x27;s useful to know what it&#x27;s good for and</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and does not leave an oily feel on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I was really impressed by Acure Organics, I&#x27;ll definetly be buying it again in the future my bottle seems to be lasting quite awhile.</li>
            <li> Not greasy or oily; absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I have been loyal to Josie Maran Argan oil for quite a while, but its price has me searching for some cheaper alternatives.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and does not leave skin feeling oily.</li>
            <li> Not greasy, super moisturize.</li>
            <li> It also disappears quickly, I smell it when I apply it</li>
            <li> Super duper bummed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to the results after several months usage and this wonderful product will definitely be a permanent part of my skin care regime.</li>
            <li> People have to understand that the more chemicals you gonna use the older</li>
            <li> Just about four drops on my face at night after a very gentle cleanser, and my skin is fantastic 24 hours a day.</li>
            <li> IS A WINNING COMPANY FOR ITS NATURAL PRODUCTS!!</li>
            <li> will add that the smell goes away pretty quickly which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used Argan oil, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> I also believe Acure released  this oil infused with different scents along with the original (Rose, Citrus and Coconut)</li>
            <li> I do not understand why you would choose to pay for expense face lotions when a few drops of this oil massaged into skin nightly is all you&#x27;ll ever need for beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different argan oils before including a batch my old boss brought back from Israel (that was the best).</li>
            <li> It is good with my husbands dry cracked hands.</li>
            <li> This is the second bottle of this oil, it is fabulous!!</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin healthy looking and soft!</li>
            <li> I actually put it on dry hair (just the length, not the roots, though you will have to experiment to determine what method of application works best for you).  </li>
            <li> More of a natural earthy smell, not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I love it so much I&#x27;d pay a lot more for it, but glad the price is much less now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced any break-outs and my skin seems a little smoother.</li>
            <li> No chemicals, nothing unnatural, just 100% organic argan oil that has managed to erase fine lines and leave my skin feeling soft and smooth, not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a really great, totally natural moisturizer to keep your skin balanced all day long (and help with blemishes and tone), order this product right now!</li>
            <li> The lines on my face haven&#x27;t really faded yet, but my face feels fantastic.</li>
            <li> I even put it on my eczema to calm it.  </li>
            <li> argan oil thought it was worth trying.  </li>
            <li> The oil I received was fresh and arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> I have spent lots of money of good quality moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> good product  work as expected</li>
            <li> Love it for my mature skin.  </li>
            <li> Will buy again and its useful.  </li>
            <li> A friend of mine recommended it after learning that I used a cheap Target facial moisturizer and my goodness I am so glad I switched over.</li>
            <li> the results are glowing golden skin.  </li>
            <li> honestly can&#x27;t say anything about how well it works because I just can&#x27;t stand the smell enough to put it on my face or hair.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> They are worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I love that it is odorless and fast absorbing.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the natural properties of Argan oil.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out (in spite of the fact that I have a sensitive complexion), so if I can find a use for it, I will gladly add it to my line-up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update if I have any success with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my favorite oil thus far.  </li>
            <li> I am 68 years old and if the oil can make my face look more youthful everyone of all ages should use it.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is perfect in that it is not too thin, and rubs right into the skin.</li>
            <li> I had to buy another bottle because she used the first one so quickly.  </li>
            <li> Now that its getting colder, I use a little more, but its still soaking in quickly and my makeup wears well over top.  </li>
            <li> It smells rancid and went right into the trash.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t seem right putting oil on it.  </li>
            <li> This is not oily on skin but settles right in.  </li>
            <li> So now, in order to solve this problem, every time I use it, I have to unscrew the frickin&#x27; top, and use the plastic hose part of the top that extends down into the oil, to wipe the oil on my skin.</li>
            <li> Refinery29 did an entire blog on the best beauty products a few months back, which is where I discovered this AMAZING skincare gem.</li>
            <li> gave it four stars because of the smell,  which obviously makes it a less than perfect product.</li>
            <li> This is the first product I have tried from their line and given the success I will try</li>
            <li> I add a few drops to my moisturizer at night and my skin looks and feels amazing!</li>
            <li> Great product I usually buy it from mothers.  </li>
            <li> , just didn&#x27;t leave the nice moisturizing effect for long, like argan does.</li>
            <li> I use this right after the acure facial cleanser for combo to oily skin, these are the only two products I have been using and my skin is looking great.</li>
            <li> I sometimes take a tiny drop, rub it in my hands, and run it through my (very fine, color treated, split end prone) hair after a wash.</li>
            <li> (I never got many anyway, but still), and my skin seems to be a little more even in terms of tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Using anti-blemish products of any kind can often leave your skin dry and irritated.  </li>
            <li> The item came fairly quickly but really seemed lacking in the quality area.</li>
            <li> I have normal skin that can get slightly oily during the day so this routine is working great for this time of year.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product very highly!</li>
            <li> Great - especially for the prove .recommend as I&#x27;ve bought facial oils for $60 and they are only slightly better.</li>
            <li> Within 24 hours I noticed the inflammation in my skin completely decrease, acne scars began to fade, fine lines disappeared.  </li>
            <li> I used to use so many products to try to balance sensitive skin, then oily skin, then dry skin, and most of the time</li>
            <li> so I have no doubts that it&#x27;s fresh and pure.</li>
            <li> After using it for only couple of weeks I could see more evenness in my skin tone.</li>
            <li> My first time with this oil.</li>
            <li> it arrived fast!</li>
            <li> Been using this a couple weeks now, and my skin feels smooth and soft</li>
            <li> Leaves it soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This has happened to me many times, but I&#x27;ve learned to use the back of my hand to wipe off excess oil there before combing my bangs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you use a small pea amount it will absorb into your skin without the oily look, but if you use more of a dime size amount then it will mostly sit on the skin for a while.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I bought Argan oil and this literally smells like diarrhea.</li>
            <li> My first time purchasing.</li>
            <li> this one spells different from the authentic one.</li>
            <li> My husband said that I look like a girl from the Robert Palmer video and kept singing the lyrics to &amp;#34;addicted to love.&amp;#34; Funny, but</li>
            <li> I love their products, will buy shampoo and condish next.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews because lez be real, ain&#x27;t nobody got time for that!</li>
            <li> Now, granted I have pretty oily, acne-prone skin</li>
            <li> Argan oil absorbs pretty well into your skin and it didn&#x27;t make me break out at all.</li>
            <li> I am sure this product should not have such a nauseating smells.</li>
            <li> Smells kinda funny at first but goes away after applied.</li>
            <li> Instead I see better skin tone and my pores appear smaller.  </li>
            <li> I discovered after some research that argan oil should never be packaged in a clear bottle because light can make it deteriorate.</li>
            <li> It might be stored in a hot place and the oil has changed.</li>
            <li> True Argan oil, has a light nutty fragrance and the label should only have 100% Argan Oil on the ingredients.</li>
            <li> In short, I love it</li>
            <li> Many women I talk to express the same fears about trying Argan oil.</li>
            <li> and I most definitely was going out on a limb trying it.</li>
            <li> This one is supposed to be used on the skin, but it stays very greasy and does not get absorbed, like the Watt does.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t love about it (which made me hover over that 4-star rating) is that is seems to bother my eyes a bit.</li>
            <li> my oil has no smell and actually smells lovely........</li>
            <li> I have used argan oil for years,however the first time I have used this brand  </li>
            <li> it absorbs quick and leaves a soft, fresh glow.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is also important to know that although our oils are housed in clear bottles so that you can enjoy the beautiful color of the oils, they are UV etched, meaning they are indeed protected from UV light, which can ultimately cause a breakdown of the essential fatty acids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> NOT ALL ARGAN OILS ARE CREATED EQUALLY, and this is pure, top grade stuff.</li>
            <li> I use it in combination with other products and it has done amazingly well.</li>
            <li> I just want health skin that is soft and if the product hides a few fine lines - all the better!  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about putting straight oil onto my oily face, but this is a wonderful product.  </li>
            <li> It does smell a bit strange, but it isn&#x27;t strong and dissipates once it has been absorbed.</li>
            <li> a little goes along way blown away by how fast I received it very very pleased</li>
            <li> So obviously, wanting to treat my skin better, I decided to research more simple, organic, natural, and healthier ways to moisturize my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin looks more vibrant and I have no dry skin (and we live at 7,000 feet!)</li>
            <li> That combo has made my skin super soft, and supple.</li>
            <li> Also it seems less effective as the 1st bottle I bought from store.  </li>
            <li> I pop this on my finger, 1 drop in the morning and 2 drops in the night, rub them, and apply it around my nose and the mouth &amp; between eyebrows as they tend to get most dry.</li>
            <li> Pure and organic.</li>
            <li> Then I ordered just the pure argan oil.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s pure.  </li>
            <li> This product is pure argan oil;</li>
            <li> adult acne (which I&#x27;ve had constantly for the past 12 years) is gone and my skin is perfectly balanced.  </li>
            <li> I have combination skin, and thought it might leave the oilier spots too oily, but it&#x27;s effectively saturated the dry and oilier spots evenly--making my whole face soft and blemish free.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This facial oil helps to decrease fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It worked fine, but as it starting to get warmer my skin oilier.</li>
            <li> But this product is scentless, and is of very high quality.</li>
            <li> My skin has filled fine lines in and my sunspots have almost disappeared(I had some very dark ones).  </li>
            <li> , i use many pure oils on my face but this one has topped them all, my skin feels like silk and my pores looks smaller, it gives me that dewy glow that im always trying to achieve naturally.</li>
            <li> and I always got real argan oil.</li>
            <li> I was really upset I paid for it.</li>
            <li> My skin feels moisturized and much softer.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend!  </li>
            <li> It thins your skin and you have to be a lot more careful about sun-exposure, etc.</li>
            <li> A bottle can often go for $17 at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> But surprisingly enough it is light and absorbs well.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely</li>
            <li> really helps with acne.</li>
            <li> and this stuff really helps.</li>
            <li> I switched to this from the Emu oil since the Emu oil wasn&#x27;t doing much for my skin anymore, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Really.</li>
            <li> This smell is really distracting and makes me not want to use the product.</li>
            <li> I bought this from a Whole Foods store, so not Amazon this time.</li>
            <li> I have very oily acne prone skin</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this from Whole Foods but for convenience, I bought it online this time.  </li>
            <li> This soaks in very well</li>
            <li> Very well priced.</li>
            <li> Perfect for keeping your skin moisturized in this freezing cold weather.</li>
            <li> What else could one ask for, really.</li>
            <li> I put this on my face and really like that it absorbs in and is not greasy and</li>
            <li> This is the real deal, 100% argan oil.</li>
            <li> I can really get on board with an organic/natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It really gives me a glow when I wake in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I used to have very oily skin...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> 1 bottle lasts me a whole season.</li>
            <li> Non-greasy and doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell.</li>
            <li> Pump it gently though to avoid it squirting</li>
            <li> This is no miracle cure, and it does take some time to see any result, but if I run out of it, I can tell after a week or so that I really need to buy more.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable, also.</li>
            <li> This is very affordable for argan oil.  </li>
            <li> It really soothes and moisturizes your skin.  </li>
            <li> If I could I would buy this for my whole body</li>
            <li> I bought mine at Whole foods.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t justify paying twice as much for Josie Maran&#x27;s oil even though I don&#x27;t like the smell of this one.</li>
            <li> any kind that is 100% organic argan oil and there are quite a few out there.  </li>
            <li> All I use now is Simple Micellar water to cleanse, Acure&#x27;s Rose &amp; Red Tea Toner, and this powerhouse oil to seal in moisture.</li>
            <li> Given that I cannot ascertain any meaningful difference between the two, I&#x27;ll be buying this oil in the near future.</li>
            <li> I am pregnant and my skin has been super dry.</li>
            <li> If you use just the right amount, then the results are silky, non-frizzy hair without the help of a professional stylist.  </li>
            <li> : When using, make sure the bottle is straight upright and catch the bursts in your other hand.</li>
            <li> And for those who cannot wait for results, it makes your skin very soft after first application.</li>
            <li> If you tried the other brands, try Acure, it&#x27;s so much better.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair healthy, shinny without any other products.</li>
            <li> I purchased it to use as a moisturizer but have enjoyed other benefits as well.</li>
            <li> I was excited to use this initially because of the price point and it was USDA organic.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this and will be repurchasing again from this seller if possible, shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li> I live in CO where the air is very dry and skin shrivels up pretty easily, so for people in my area, this is a must have.  </li>
            <li> Logic tells me that while it may have good properties for treating such a condition (EFA&#x27;s and vitamin E, etc.), if skin is still dry shortly after use, this increases the likely hood of fine lines, thus being counter-intuitive.</li>
            <li> It is easily absorbable and has no particular smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was also worried by negative reviews I saw, so I wrote to Acure to see what they&#x27;d say in response to the most common issues I saw reviewers had: the cost (too cheap for what it is), bottling (clear bottle not an effective way to protect the product), manufacturing (is this pure oil, or does it go through a chemical process), and smell (doesn&#x27;t smell nutty like Argan oil is supposed</li>
            <li> Makes skin smooth, helps to dry skin.</li>
            <li> I like how it helps smooth out my dry skin.</li>
            <li> pm, it aborbs well and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy (with all oils less is more, I use one pump).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that quality Argan oil is always sold in darker bottles to maintain the integrity of the products, but I&#x27;m sure those brands are probably more expensive.</li>
            <li> I use mainly around my eyes but also spread to the rest of my face and in areas that are damaged from sun.  </li>
            <li> As far as a wrinkle-fighting oil, I can&#x27;t really comment on that since I don&#x27;t really have that problem....</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product to use on the ends of my long stick-thin hair, but upon doing some research, I decided to try it on my skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this prodcut</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I am on my first bottle of this and will be buying a second when I run out, which is saying a lot because I usually don&#x27;t re-purchase face products for moisturizing as I haven&#x27;t found anything I loved and that didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and I certainly would not recommend it for sensitive skins.</li>
            <li> Not sure what I can describe it as, just to say that I am very easily offended by smells,</li>
            <li> Spend a little more on another brand</li>
            <li> That worked a little better, but not much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is important because when undergoing heat processing (commonly when processed by machinery) most of the precious essential fatty acids and vitamin E are lost.  </li>
            <li> Really makes hair soft, feels healthier.  </li>
            <li> my heels feel real soft.</li>
            <li> My skin type is combination, very prone to acne and sensitive to chemical.</li>
            <li> my mature skin is much smoother, tighter, and lines are diminishing.  </li>
            <li> My scars appear less dramatic and I have received so many compliments on how good my complexion</li>
            <li> I used my moms for a few days and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> I follow with a normal moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m left with glowing, fresh- looking skin that belies my age.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, like all the Acure Organics products I have tired.</li>
            <li> I have had argan oil from other companies and it smelled fine.</li>
            <li> I had a bottle of Acure Organics Argan Facial Oil in my cupboard that I actually bought for my hair but was too scared to use it on my face since I breakout so easily.</li>
            <li> I also find it works well in hair to tame frizz, but don&#x27;t use too much...certainly better than silicone-based serums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This argan oil is fine for the price, but I find that it does not absorb as well as Josie Maran (which is more expensive) and sits atop the skin.</li>
            <li> She wanted me to test out a new product (EpiDuo) which is a retinol with benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li> ever since i moved to new york</li>
            <li> I picked up this line at a health food store in upstate New York.</li>
            <li> And be on the lookout for the launch of our new site that will have treatment reviews, spa reviews and product reviews.</li>
            <li> See you at pimples and wrinkles!ur new site that will have treatment reviews, spa reviews and product reviews.</li>
            <li> but when I needed a new bottle they were out of it.</li>
            <li> I have definitely noticed my hair looks better, is more manageable (less frizzy), and my scalp flakes less.  </li>
            <li> know an ounce doesn&#x27;t sound like a lot, but with the dropper, and only needing about 3 drops, this will last a while, and save me lots of money!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve definitely noticed that it has decreased the scarring and redness on my face as well.&lt;br /&gt;All around a great product.</li>
            <li> Iâ€™ve tried doing it more slowly, but it doesnâ€™t help much.</li>
            <li> It seems cheap and water down, not thick at all like what some of the reviews said.  </li>
            <li> I have combination skin that is very sensitive and prone to hormonal acne along my jawline.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft and glowy.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin with pores and acne scars.  </li>
            <li> And thus, because we include argan oil in almost every single one of our formulations, we purchase the oil in such large quantities that we receive a significant discount, which in turn, is passed on to the consumer in the form of affordable pricing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> And thus, because we include argan oil in almost every single one of our formulations, we purchase the oil in such large quantities that we receive a significant discount, which in turn, is passed on to the consumer in the form of affordable pricing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use any of my normal products which are all formulated for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> product was exactly what I needed and I haven&#x27;t looked back.</li>
            <li> I am excited to try their other products.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know if the contents are exactly the same.  </li>
            <li> I only put it on after hot showers.  </li>
            <li> I have seen slight improvement around my eyes where I had fine lines.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the Josie Maran argan oil for the past year and love it.</li>
            <li> I received my first order from this brand and it has white stuff floating around.</li>
            <li> Both are amazing on the skin, feel silky, not greasy, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My scars are so much less pronounced and smooth.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, but I&#x27;m not sure how to fit it in my skincare regimen.  </li>
            <li> The first bottle I purchased had no scent at all, and it was clear with a tint of yellow.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, mature skin and</li>
            <li> And the little bottle will last you for about 4 months or even more because you just need a small amount I love this product</li>
            <li> Some of the other reviews characterized it as a sweet, nutty smell, but mine smelled rancid, like rotten nuts or briny olives.</li>
            <li> I even added pure jasmine essential oil,  </li>
            <li> The scent is very light, and faintly floral, and the oil is easily absorbed.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say there have been any dramatic changes, but I&#x27;ve noticed that my make-up is easier to apply and I&#x27;ve experienced fewer dry patches.</li>
            <li> If you are looking to avoid artificial ingredients, this argan oil is a great choice.  </li>
            <li> I want to make it clear too, that this doesn&#x27;t seem to be a problem with some sort of defectiveness in one unit, but in the fundamental way these are made.</li>
            <li> A few drops at night after cleansing are all you need for soft, smooth, glowing skin in the morning.  </li>
            <li> My skin&#x27;s never been so clear or soft.</li>
            <li> I tried the Sensitive skin face wash from Burt&#x27;s bees and this caused an allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li> Sensitive skin&lt;</li>
            <li> So far no complaints.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s has no preservatives or additives, it&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li> If you use too much of this product, then you can overdo it to the point where your hair will actually look oily.  </li>
            <li> However, argan oil has absolutely changed my entire routine.  </li>
            <li> I apply it directly to my skin--face, neck, hands, wherever.  </li>
            <li> and I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I bought this oil because I heard that it serves as a non-greasy, natural and organic moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This leaves your skin soft and supple not oily as I would have thought.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s just the natural scent of the oil.</li>
            <li> Even in Lake Tahoe snow it kept my face soft and the dryness at bay.</li>
            <li> so I recommend using an organic facial lotion as a carrier substance so you can adjust how much your skin can absorb.</li>
            <li> This oil is improving my skin and it feels really soft.</li>
            <li> I put a teeny tiny amount on my palm, and rub it very well into my face.  </li>
            <li> it smells like old tires or something.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Its been 2 week so far</li>
            <li> Keeps my acne at bay, tightened my skin, provided youthful glow, helped my skin look and feel young again.</li>
            <li> I replace my night cream with it once in a while and wake up with a brighter, soft and fresh-looking skin with some imperfections muted.</li>
            <li> an nearly 50 years old,</li>
            <li> So far I like this stuff</li>
            <li> Our local Whole Foods store had the 2oz Acure Argan Oil on sale for $20.24.  </li>
            <li> my 86 year old mother uses it on her face every day.  </li>
            <li> This product makes my face so soft and supple, but does not cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> The oil makes my face feel so soft, not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried some in my hair yesterday and my hair feels so soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m probably just going to start pouring this oil into my old Josie Maran bottle</li>
            <li> This one works just as well at moisturizing as the synthetic creams do, but is all natural and has added benefits.  </li>
            <li> It moisturizes, it improves the condition of your skin, hair, and scalp; and it&#x27;s all natural.  </li>
            <li> I use this to replace night time lotion and it has completely turned around my skin.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better hair oils I have used lately.  </li>
            <li> Do not put on your skin if yo have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have always dealt with adult acne prone, combo skin</li>
            <li> I am type a person who loves everything natural not chemicals or parabens.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive combination/oily skin(dark)</li>
            <li> I wake up with soft, plump skin.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is not nearly as dry (particularly in winter weather).</li>
            <li> I cut it with jojoba and rose hip oil from time to time to extend its use and to approximate a serum of sorts.</li>
            <li> In protest, I&#x27;m going to try other Argan oils to try to find BOTH an oil I love and someone who actually spent some time trying to think of the customer who is trying to use the damn bottle so they don&#x27;t wind up with oil all over the place.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it will do me better in the spring/summer after cleansing since my skin is less dry during that time of year.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s oily and dry at the same time with mild acne.</li>
            <li> , I completely went off other moisturizers to make sure it was this product and not a combination of other factors.  </li>
            <li> My face is so moisturized and the redness is the most subtle it has ever been.  </li>
            <li> While it goes on slightly oily it quickly absorbs and does not leave your skin feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I picked up this particular brand at my local grocery and on day 4 (today) all signs of irritation are gone.  </li>
            <li> It is 100% pure and does go on thick but soaks in fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> I pump a few pumps out, rub my hands together, and then pat through my hair with a special focus on the ends.  </li>
            <li> My face feels smooth and moisturized even in the winter when its usually dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first time I put it in my wet hair before blow drying (like I always do) and it made it so oily -</li>
            <li> I wish the dropper of the Acure oil was a little more like the JM dropper though - the end is not tapered, but flat, so sometimes a drop or two extra comes out.</li>
            <li> I love the simplicity of a 1 ingredient product and hope the other purported benefits are even half true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> IT REALLY HELP DRY SKIN.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I would recommend it for someone suffering from acne, but for dry problem skin it&#x27;s been very healing and brightening.  </li>
            <li> At first it has a strange scent, but I&#x27;m starting to see</li>
            <li> 29 yr old female, sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Not sure which of the Acure products to give the most credit to: the Argan Oil, the Brightening Facial Scrub or the Facial Cleansing Creme.</li>
            <li> but I recommend trying it (for the price you really have nothing to loose)........</li>
            <li> Incredibly rich in Vitamin E, Essential Fatty Acids, and Proteins, Argan Oil is said to help fight lines, repair imperfections, minimize scars + stretch marks, restore texture, elasticity and tone, and reduce inflammation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Argan Oil is 100% pure, unrefined and unprocessed.  </li>
            <li> Please rest assured it is indeed 100% pure USDA certified organic Argan Oil, and is unrefined and unprocessed.  </li>
            <li> Please rest assured it is indeed 100% pure USDA certified organic Argan Oil, and is unrefined and unprocessed.  </li>
            <li> This was my first time ordering from Acure Organics, and while I like the oil, I&#x27;m not enjoying the particular smell it has.</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s also highly affordable compared to some more complicated hair treatments on the market.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s prob good stuff, but beware it is extremely greasy on your face , and the smell is strong and pretty horrific .</li>
            <li> My skin has been AMAZING for 8 months now, and I will never consider using an expensive product line again.  </li>
            <li> The anti-inflammatory properties of the Argan Oil have minimized break outs and if I do get a blemish it generally disappears overnight.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t really like is the smell, it&#x27;s strange, but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it, and I will continue to use it for the results it gives me.</li>
            <li> what it is that seens to be in facial cleansers even if they are natural or organic.  </li>
            <li> As an adult, I&#x27;ve had my hair highlighted here and there, but have basically left it alone.  </li>
            <li> So far it hasn&#x27;t clogged my pores, and I only use it at night along with witch hazel toner, AHA souffle, and hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li> Its the only one i have tried as far as Argan Oil</li>
            <li> Use with Acure sensitive skin facial wash.</li>
            <li> My face use to be very greasy and my pores very big, after starting to use it oil is under control and pores seem to be smaller.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and look younger after I use t the product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m taking it back and contacting Acure directly to find out why.</li>
            <li> I use it at night and also in the morning under my sheer, natural Dr. Hauschka makeup.  </li>
            <li> I am a big fan of natural products and decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li> It feels really thin and stays on top of my skin unlike the others I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am now on my second bottle, and have to say I wouldn&#x27;t want to live without it in my facial skincare routine.  </li>
            <li> My light scars have dissipated, my skin is dewy and aglow all day long, my skin tone has evened out (which was my main issue), and I hardly break out anymore.</li>
            <li> a semi-deep wrinkle on my check has decreased significantly that I actually have to really look for it to see any trace of it.  </li>
            <li> A year ago Acure sold their oil for $29, now it&#x27;s $15 other places for some reason, $15 at Whole Foods and Vitamin cottage.</li>
            <li> The body is not made for chemicals check all the people who live in different countries that dont have access  to these expensive chemical products they look better than those who does.</li>
            <li> Even though I have naturally oily/combination skin, the Argan oil actually helped to moisturize my skin while not creating extra oil.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive and dry skin with some redness.  </li>
            <li> Light or plastic bottles degrade the product and it is far too tedious of a product to make for a true company to waste with improper packaging.</li>
            <li> While it has had the same effects as Josie Maran&#x27;s Argan Oil, it has a very odd and distinct smell to it that Josie Maran&#x27;s oil does not.</li>
            <li> but this was not a good fit for us.</li>
            <li> My aesthetician recommended finding a basic organic gentle cleanser and getting rid of all other product, and then adding argan oil as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> After doing much research I decided to give Argan Oil a try, in one night it gave my skin moisture, my acne went down along with my eczema.</li>
            <li> Argan Oil, much like other crops, such as wine and cheese, does vary depending on things such as seasonality and climate.  </li>
            <li> So even without chlorinated swimming pools or peroxide highlights, my hair remained dry and damaged looking unless I had it professionally styled at a salon.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive, oily acne prone skin that gets dry, flaky from treatments.</li>
            <li> Thus far, I&#x27;ve used it on my hands which have been dry during the winter months.</li>
            <li> I hve extremely dry sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical of this stuff at first, but after researching and reading so many reviews, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I assumed that maybe I just used too much and tried it again today with much less and got the same result.</li>
            <li> It seems that most people with very thick hair also have very dry, coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> Since this is a small bottle, I carry in my handbag and rub it onto my face whenever it&#x27;s feeling super dry.</li>
            <li> It is less expensive than some other brands, but is just as effective and pure of a product.</li>
            <li> I use a very small amount after I wash my face at night &amp; in the morning, it rubs in quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li> My skin has cleared up and is much less dry and looks much healthier and younger.  </li>
            <li> I like this product very much and it is very close to meeting the standards of expensive products such as Este Lauder and Shiseido.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands before and wanted an all natural version so tried this.</li>
            <li> I have to be very careful what I put on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> After 2 weeks my skin is significantly less red, less fine lines, less breakouts.</li>
            <li> The following morning, I just splash with alternating cold and warm water and blot my face dry before applying tinted mineral moisturizer and powder.</li>
            <li> If I have tangles (definitely possible, since I go to bed with semi-wet hair and my hair is long), this helps get rid of them, especially at the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used almost all different kinds of skin care on the market from cheap to expensive and I just keep coming back to acure products.</li>
            <li> This Argan oil I use on my hair which is long and processed blonde.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a million products for moisturizing at night, and none of them lasted long enough to keep my face from drying out and, as a result, overcompensating with loads of oil by morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was slow to come around to using Argan oil for the first time, so I am a latecomer to the party.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace my moisturizer but it leaves my skin dry and flaky in some areas, even with daily use for over a week.</li>
            <li> dry, broke out and red splotchy skin).</li>
            <li> the dry climate has been torturing my skin - it was dry, flaky, constantly irritated and red.</li>
            <li> I was having dry skin and acne issues and can&#x27;t use salicylic acid or anything similar.  </li>
            <li> Smells weird, makes my skin glow, absorbs easily.</li>
            <li> my make up did not stay on at all because of oiliness, but at the same time I saw patches of dry areas on my cheek.</li>
            <li> This is my only moisturizer, and it does the trick, providing all day softness and smoothness to my usually dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t use anything so harsh in quite a while and my skin was extra sensitive since I had been using Retin-A.</li>
            <li> These types of ingredients wreak havoc on those of us with sensitive skin, and also cause build up under the surface of skin, making it harder and harder for moisturizers to penetrate.</li>
            <li> This stuff will last a long, long time.</li>
            <li> However, in less than half an hour, it was completely absorbed (hooray to the non-greasy nature of argan oil!), but my face felt tight again (boo to the return of dry skin!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the seriously firming serum was much nicer to use for my face!</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin in the morning especially in the chin and my jaw area, but since using argan oil problem solved.</li>
            <li> in order to let the natural oils help my hair look less dry.  </li>
            <li> I typically have dry skin but with this oil, my skin feels soft and moist.  </li>
            <li> It stinks and this product is not 100% authentic.</li>
            <li> I usually love Acure organics products but this oil STINKS</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a lot so the bottle lasts a LONG time and your skin absorbs the oil, regardless of your skin type.</li>
            <li> she has long curly hair as well</li>
            <li> It is strange, and I&#x27;m going to return it.</li>
            <li> long range!&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> out of frustration for wasting money on produts, recently I&#x27;ve become more curious about what is actually in my \\&quot;beloved\\&quot; expensive face lotions; did my own research, to find that they&#x27;re loaded with synthetic ingredients, silicones and other plastics (the fact is that advertising as \\&quot;natural\\&quot;, \\&quot;mineral\\&quot; and \\&quot;free of fragrances and parabens\\&quot; means nothing in the cosmetic and skin-care industry, there&#x27;s plenty of other fake, filler crap to throw in your product).</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, acne prone combination skin that usually breaks out from just about everything.</li>
            <li> I only wash my hair once every other week</li>
            <li> use Acure on my face, when I am in the shower, I mix it with my soap, and at times when my hair is a little dry, I have mixed it with my shampoo and conditioner to give my hair it extra moisture and shine without dreading it getting too oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wonder if the problem is what several others have mentioned that the oil is in a clear bottle and that causes it to go bad so quickly</li>
            <li> Anyone who has dry skin</li>
            <li> This oil is my go-to for the dry winter air in Utah.  </li>
            <li> My face doesn&#x27;t get oily overnight, and my skin doesn&#x27;t dry out during the day.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin</li>
            <li> I am on chemotherapy and my hands and face had been extremely dry but the Argan oil solved the problem and moisturized my skin.</li>
            <li> I can use it on my dry skin and on my child&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve used this on my face - winter air is dry</li>
            <li> My skin gets soooo dry in the winter.  </li>
            <li> and I wanted a moisturizers and smoothing agent for after blow dry.  </li>
            <li> if your skin is dry / acne prone / high-pigmentation scarred, def give this a go.</li>
            <li> My skin has been so dry this winter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy who has dry skin issues in the winter, and I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of moisturizing products.  </li>
            <li> makes my hair actually dry out.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this oil for use on my face to see if it would help with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find this product to be helpful for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I use it every single night.  </li>
            <li> I really hate to give this product a bad review since I&#x27;m a huge fan of Acure, but this isn&#x27;t a great product.</li>
            <li> This is not normal, and it is not the &amp;#34;nutty&amp;#34; smell from argan oil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super strong and it goes away once you rub it in, but it is weird.</li>
            <li> I would think if you&#x27;re going to use it on your hair, you&#x27;d have to use sparingly as it&#x27;ll likely weigh down your hair and give it a &amp;#34;I</li>
            <li> This has made my skin smoother, with smaller pores, softer and less acne.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t leave reviews but had to for this because its made such a big difference on my skin.</li>
            <li> Just a drop or 2 on your hand then rub into your ends either wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> I have the Daily Oil Control cream from Acure, as well as the night cream, so I&#x27;m not sure where this facial oil should go.  </li>
            <li> While argan oil doesn&#x27;t erase the acne scars, it has definitely made them less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I woke up Sunday morning with a dry, itchy, inflamed chin - origin unknown.  </li>
            <li> I have eczema on my arms and very dry skin.</li>
            <li> and sometimes my skin gets very dry.</li>
            <li> I use this in the winter under my daily moisturizer because I live in a cold, dry, urban area and a moisturizer alone isn&#x27;t enough.</li>
            <li> This is obviously a scam, no argan oil should ever be kept in anything other than a dark glass bottle.</li>
            <li> Before his hair turned gray, it was a light-to-medium brown color that was very thick, and unlike my sister&#x27;s hair or my hair, very silky, regardless of what brand of shampoos or conditioners he used.  </li>
            <li> Either way, I&#x27;ve stopped using it on my face, and have relegated it to elbows, ankles, cuticles and other dry patches.</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t agree with this product, or perhaps I just had bad timing: too many blemishes.</li>
            <li> All products are free from animal testing, parabens, sulfates, phthalates, synthetic fragrances, harmful preservatives and artificial colors.</li>
            <li> I always have a few Argan oils for back up.  </li>
            <li> Helps my acne and rough skin.</li>
            <li> and I am usually not very picky with the way things smell.</li>
            <li> not really the look</li>
            <li> I Wear it after washing my face while it&#x27;s still wet, it is not greasy at all, my skin absorbs everything.  </li>
            <li> Avoid applying it wet hair.  </li>
            <li> I did not return it only because I find it&#x27;s just a waste of my time.  </li>
            <li> This multipurpose product can be used underneath your eyes and on other delicate facial skin areas, but I prefer to use it on my very dry, coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> have very dry skin that tends to get extremely oily if I don&#x27;t keep it well moisturized.</li>
            <li> It helps cure bumps, dark spots, and dry skin.</li>
            <li> The first one I bought didnt, the second and third smelled so bad I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> Both oils have a similar smell (the Josie Maran oil smells a little less nutty),</li>
            <li> A little bit of this oil goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Also, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> this oil, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Everyone else recommended tea tree oil but for some reason it&#x27;s VERY hard to find that where I live.</li>
            <li> I had to keep reapplying it to get rid of that dry, tight feeling.</li>
            <li> Also, after purchasing the oil, I read that high-quality argan oil should come in a dark blue or black glass bottle, because exposure to light causes the oil to go bad.</li>
            <li> I think that the years of soap use along with other things has caused this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try other cleansers that weren&#x27;t soap to lessen the harshness on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I buy this every time I run out and have yet to experience a &amp;#34;foul smelling&amp;#34; one like other users.</li>
            <li> I like that the glass bottle can be recycled, but I do not know what to do with the pump afterwards other than to toss it, which is a shame.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As soon as I stopped using it and went back to my usual moisturizer my skin cleared up.</li>
            <li> not sure why others have such problems with the smell.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of the Acure argan oil a while back and just started using it two weeks ago as my usual skincare regiment wasn&#x27;t working anymore (</li>
            <li> I have to agree with some of the other reviews...</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not able to use it on my face, especially being preggo.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem to aggravate it / something almost all other moisturizers seem to do.</li>
            <li> I bought this argan oil from a health food store after trying argan oils from different brands in the past.</li>
            <li> I also want to respond to the other reviews about the smell.........</li>
            <li> My sister on the other hand loves it.</li>
            <li> I still sometimes have dryness around my eyes but it seems to be if there is hot or cold air blowing on my face or after long hours of looking at the computer.  </li>
            <li> You will need a little less in the summer than in the winter, but a bottle lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I also use a drop or two when my hands/cuticles are dry and on my hair to help tame frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way with this product, and it is incredibly heavy.  </li>
            <li> The annoying red broken blood vessel splotches on my cheeks have gone down almost completely and the tone and appearance of my skin has improved significantly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to be in a dark glass bottle.</li>
            <li> Its also great knowing that I am putting natural stuff on my face and not all the nasty ingredients that could be in expensive</li>
            <li> only complaint is the pump.</li>
            <li> I spend all this money on a product, just to be unable to get some out of the bottle and onto my skin, and no matter HOW gently I press the dispenser, the damn thing shoots out oil all over the counter.</li>
            <li> Argan oil should be sold in a dark bottle&#x27; this is not.</li>
            <li> It has healing properties that assist with clearin up acne dark spots etc.</li>
            <li> , it just doesn&#x27;t smell like the average fragranced cream.  </li>
            <li> I researched and found that argan oil should be sold in dark containers.</li>
            <li> and this has helped reverse the scars and lighten up the dark spots and circles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already gone through 2 bottles of this, and though it does last forever, I find myself needing at least 3 pumps to cover my face and neck.</li>
            <li> It is not easily absorbed as described.</li>
            <li> reason I even gave it 3 stars is because their products are usually so good and organic but this product is awful!</li>
            <li> Now I have finally found a product that will give my very thick, dry, wavy hair the illusion of silkiness.  </li>
            <li> So, I decided to apply it after patting my face down with water, or after a shower.</li>
            <li> Forget about all the other stuff!  </li>
            <li> Recommend this product for moisture, very little scent, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I also had some pretty terrible stretch marks from having a giant baby, and started to apply a few drops to my stomach and rub it in well, wow!</li>
            <li> I adore the seriously firming facial oil by this company and will never be without it.</li>
            <li> But it does have a slightly odd smell to it.</li>
            <li> In the past, I have been an avid user of expensive face care products but what prompted me to switch was turning 30.</li>
            <li> and previously I would never dream of putting oil on my skin.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, argan oil has a slight smell of manure.</li>
            <li> I could not understand why this oil was nearly half the price.</li>
            <li> I initially was using Josie maran argan oil but thought the price was ridiculous after a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even used it on slight burns, wounds, and as a massage oil for sore muscles; and it seemed to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is cold pressed by hand, first pressing of the nut and is sourced from a womens co-op in Morocco.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair that has a lot of wave to it</li>
            <li> the tight feeling went away and it wasn&#x27;t overly greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use about three to four drops a day in my thick, dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Argan Oil should be stored in a dark container and this is in a clear one making it go bad - gross.</li>
            <li> Looking for  something to  heal  scars on face and  after  doing a  little  reading  about  </li>
            <li> I showed this to my little sister and she swears by it and uses it both day and night.</li>
            <li> I do sometimes put a little on during the day too.</li>
            <li> It is also a lot thicker or &amp;#34;greasier&amp;#34; than other Argan oils that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I was a little unsure because I have oily skin on my T zone</li>
            <li> Little</li>
            <li> I am always sad after a week of trying something new that I even left behind something I know works so well.</li>
            <li> No extra unnecessary ingredients either.</li>
            <li> I had my concerns that it might be too heavy.</li>
            <li> I was putting all these harsh chemicals all over my body that my dermatologist prescribed, she would always say i have to wait 2-6 weeks to see results.</li>
            <li> I also use a few drops in organic leave-in conditioner for my hair.  </li>
            <li> One of the few brands I could find that was 100% Arran oil as well.</li>
            <li> Itâ€™s not a smooth pump when you want to dispense the oil.</li>
            <li> thing I do is put it on heavy at night before I go to bed</li>
            <li> I just turned 30 and was getting a few lines on my forehead.</li>
            <li> Heals the dried skin.</li>
            <li> I use this product almost everyday.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday on my face, I had consistence breakouts that have dissapeared.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> It does moisturize but leaves a heavy residue feeling, as if you&#x27;ve put cooking oil on your skin without the greasy feel.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through a few bottles</li>
            <li> (It also doesn&#x27;t have preservatives, so you would want to keep it at room temperature or below and use within a few months.)  </li>
            <li> and it literally healed my breakouts in a few days.</li>
            <li> I do put a night cream on after I let the oil sink in for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not a huge deal.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend also uses it as beard oil and in his hair, and he is not a huge fan of the scent (which I must admit I have not noticed).</li>
            <li> Since using the oil on face, no more black heads on nose area.</li>
            <li> my skin has little pimples everywhere and its just not &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; like it usually does.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The oil has worked wonders on my cuticles and a few small scars on my hands.</li>
            <li> I just started a doctor prescribed medication that is making my dry skin even worse (it was for acne).</li>
            <li> Anything designed for acne would dry my skin out and my face would look worse.  </li>
            <li> A little goes farther than you think it will!</li>
            <li> I use a little in my hair as I have thick, wiry hair that leaves the kids calling me Mufasa.</li>
            <li> Bottle is small.</li>
            <li> Not sure if all argan oils are stinky</li>
            <li> My husband uses this everyday on this beard!</li>
            <li> never go back to expensive, silicone-ridden products again!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I usually use a mosturizer with SPF during the day, and this when I&#x27;m not going to be wearing any oily makeup that might interact with this and at night.</li>
            <li> I usually put it on and then wait about 10 minutes before I put my make up on</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it claims that, and not sure how an oil like this would.</li>
            <li> Not sure if mentioning that I also use Koji San soap makes a difference.</li>
            <li> There are too many companies that choose the WORST bottles, dispensers!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to get past that.  </li>
            <li> so I am not sure how it should smell like.  </li>
            <li> I am not one to buy expensive miracle products to make you look 10 years younger, etc.  </li>
            <li> and you expect to end up with an oil slick on your face - not the case.  </li>
            <li> Not sure it lives up to what is says.</li>
            <li> I find it unbelievable</li>
            <li> I usually mix a drop or two in with my morning sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small bottle</li>
            <li> I also apply a small amount to the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> This oil has not caused a breakout and has kept my belly and face moisturized without feeling like an oil slick.</li>
            <li> I usually use this product at night time, before removing make up and washing my face, and it leaves my skin well moisturized and a bit glowing in the morning.</li>
            <li> the new bottle is dark yellow and smells disgusting.</li>
            <li> The oil is very heavy</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin...made even worse by dry, cold weather.</li>
            <li> i do not live in US so unfortunately</li>
            <li> (I know that that must sound terribly unhygienic!)</li>
            <li> I have acne scars and am still prone to break outs in my late 30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I just recently bought this product but am not that crazy about it.  </li>
            <li> Some people, however, have both thick and silky hair.  </li>
            <li> I also think it is not as thick and feels almost watery.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 4 because I just bought a new bottle today and it stinks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m living in a cold climate which makes my skin very dry and irritable, and cold temperatures combined with windchill result in peeling, red and chapped skin.</li>
            <li> It definitely has an unpleasant odor</li>
            <li> However, after applying a very small amount and rubbing it in, my skin doesn&#x27;t appear oily.  </li>
            <li> I saw that this was much less expensive and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> This is a must for me in the winter when it&#x27;s dry and cold where I am.  </li>
            <li> Second bottle arrived and I have never smelled anything so bad.</li>
            <li> I used another organic Argan oil before, with not nearly as good results.</li>
            <li> Plus the price is hard to beat!</li>
            <li> was also born with a small broken blood-vessel area on the bridge of my nose, and it&#x27;s fading!</li>
            <li> I have never written a review a for any facial product because I have always been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I have had terrible luck with other facial oils like marajuca.</li>
            <li> It is VERY hard to find products that work for me.</li>
            <li> it hasnt broken me out yet either.</li>
            <li> I use it to take off my eye makeup (a replacement for the unhealthy baby oil</li>
            <li> I am 25 and have hormonal acne that is made much worse with pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I figured it wouldn&#x27;t make it worse either way.</li>
            <li> Seriously Acure!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not even that bad to begin with, and youget used to the slight earthy smell.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Terrible smell, smth like rancid butter, even worse, i am afraid it is really &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; or spoilt!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few products by Acure and have never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> By no means is it unpleasant as some reviewers have complained about</li>
            <li> I swam competitively while growing up (absolutely hated it, but that&#x27;s another story for another day), and the chlorinated pool water just compounded my problems with my already dry, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed to have spend my money on this so called facial serum.</li>
            <li> Did not notice a bad odor that others have complained of.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, the Rx sample gave me a chemical burn.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always considered my skin high-maintenance because I&#x27;ve had (short-lived) \\&quot;success\\&quot; with products that are expensive and over-rated, which after about a month or 2, just stop moisturizing my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately all three bottles that I ordered had gone rancid.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t understand why Amazon still has the expensive price.</li>
            <li> Every one in my family is obsessed with Acure Argan oil.</li>
            <li> What is wrong?</li>
            <li> It also has an awful smell that you don&#x27;t want on your facial.</li>
            <li> Ever since I used this, I&#x27;ve been obsessed.</li>
            <li> I would purchase this over any expensive moisturizer any day of the week.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This argan oil also has a weird smell.</li>
            <li> I had heard about argan oil on a home shopping network program and wanted to try it, but the advertised price was rather expensive.  </li>
            <li> Having not bought Argan Oil before, I didn&#x27;t know the manure smell was wrong and passed any point of return.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but thought for this price....</li>
            <li> I have eczema, and the products I was using caused my skin to literally peel off, I know its peeling off all the bad skin, but I was unable to wear makeup</li>
            <li> I was desperate and my face needing something moisturizing, inert, anti-inflammatory and wouldn&#x27;t break me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use a meager 2 drops every night before I apply Retin-A or up to 4 drops when my skin is extra-dry.</li>
            <li> and I was desperate to find something that would help.</li>
            <li> I thought she was crazy for recommending oil for an oily skin issue.  </li>
            <li> It smells like dirty dish water.  </li>
            <li> (even non-Harvard feeder preschools are expensive!)</li>
            <li> This product has an unpleasant smell also.</li>
            <li> but this one smells really bad, like rancid.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s why my skin had a bad reaction.</li>
            <li> That may be why mine smells bad... would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Something in this smells so bad</li>
            <li> we got a bad bottle</li>
            <li> oil arrived and was BAD.</li>
            <li> and I keep getting sick</li>
            <li> Why does the argan oil I use in my hair smell like a vacation, and this smells like a dirty diaper?!</li>
            <li> This smelled like horse poo...:( so disappointed.</li>
            <li> , cannot return it :-(((</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed and would not purchase from this brand again.</li>
            <li> It smells like crap.</li>
            <li> Bad smell!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed by this.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to use on my skin and it made me break out terribly.  </li>
            <li> Also, it smells terrible.</li>
            <li> However it smells horrible.  </li>
            <li> but it smelled horribly.</li>
            <li> I have terrible combination skin</li>
            <li> Smells terrible.  </li>
            <li> The smell is awful!</li>
            <li> Smelled HORRIBLE.</li>
            <li> horrible</li>
            <li> Smells absolutely horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many expensive moisturizers, oils, and serums, and none compare to this product. I was initially worried that because it&#x27;s an oil, my face might break out (as it does with olive or coconut oil--yes, I&#x27;ve tried everything!), but it&#x27;s actually done the opposite. My skin&#x27;s never been so clear or soft. I have combination skin, and thought it might leave the oilier spots too oily, but it&#x27;s effectively saturated the dry and oilier spots evenly--making my whole face soft and blemish free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also worried by negative reviews I saw, so I wrote to Acure to see what they&#x27;d say in response to the most common issues I saw reviewers had: the cost (too cheap for what it is), bottling (clear bottle not an effective way to protect the product), manufacturing (is this pure oil, or does it go through a chemical process), and smell (doesn&#x27;t smell nutty like Argan oil is supposed to).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a response within an hour of writing to them. Here&#x27;s what they said:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Our Argan Oil is 100% pure, unrefined and unprocessed.  It is cold pressed by hand, first pressing of the nut and is sourced from a womens co-op in Morocco. This is important because when undergoing heat processing (commonly when processed by machinery) most of the precious essential fatty acids and vitamin E are lost.  Argan Oil, much like other crops, such as wine and cheese, does vary depending on things such as seasonality and climate.  And because of this, the aroma can vary greatly, from neutral to a very potent earthy or nutty aroma.  While the aroma can vary, this does not change the potency or effectiveness of the oil in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also important to know that although our oils are housed in clear bottles so that you can enjoy the beautiful color of the oils, they are UV etched, meaning they are indeed protected from UV light, which can ultimately cause a breakdown of the essential fatty acids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, in regards to cost, one of our commitments as a company is to provide not only safe &amp; effective products, but products that are affordable to the consumer.  This means that we offer every product in our line under $30, and choose to pass any savings we receive to the consumer rather than ourselves.  And thus, because we include argan oil in almost every single one of our formulations, we purchase the oil in such large quantities that we receive a significant discount, which in turn, is passed on to the consumer in the form of affordable pricing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this answers your concerns regarding our Argan Oil.  Please rest assured it is indeed 100% pure USDA certified organic Argan Oil, and is unrefined and unprocessed.  If you have any additional questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to us.&amp;#34;a company is to provide not only safe &amp; effective products, but products that are affordable to the consumer.

            <li> It stinks and this product is not 100% authentic. I always bought it on their website and I always got real argan oil. I was really upset I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and it is easy to use.I use it in combination with lotion as a body moisturizer and am enjoying using it.</li>
            <li> I have been having issues with feeling super dryness and even raw/burning around my eyes and under my eyes.  For years I have used Trader Joes brand of Tea Tree Oil soap on my face followed up by Organic Coconut Oil as a moisturizer.  I think that the years of soap use along with other things has caused this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try other cleansers that weren&#x27;t soap to lessen the harshness on my skin.  I tried the Sensitive skin face wash from Burt&#x27;s bees and this caused an allergic reaction.  I also tried Acure&#x27;s scrub and my skin became irritated as well.  I&#x27;ve had this issue before which was why I was using the soap.  There is something I am allergic to and I have no idea what it is that seens to be in facial cleansers even if they are natural or organic.  Simple has always worked best for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try the Argan oil as a face moisturizer and stay with my tea tree oil soap.  I bought the argan oil and actually decided to try washing my face with oil.  I researched it and started washing with the coconut oil and following it up with the Argan Oil.  So far so good...a semi-deep wrinkle on my check has decreased significantly that I actually have to really look for it to see any trace of it.  My skin feels moisturized and much softer.  I still sometimes have dryness around my eyes but it seems to be if there is hot or cold air blowing on my face or after long hours of looking at the computer.  I have only been using this for a week so I will update my review after about 8 wks to see where I am.</li>
            <li> Acure is a great line for people who want cruelty free, organic, and effective facial products. A little bit of this oil goes a long way. My skin is nourished, hydrated and glowing. It&#x27;s also great for nails and hair. I highly recommend!  Plus you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Oil was rancid, I returned the purchase. No replacement was available. I would discourage purchasing this again unless a fresh replacement was made available to me.</li>
            <li> I start with this Argan oil Morning and Night, then serums and then my creams.  I always have a few Argan oils for back up.  Anyone who has dry skin this is a must.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after seeing my friend who&#x27;d been using it for several months. Her skin was so smooth I decided to try it myself. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and have already received compliments on my skin. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> LOVE ðŸ’›ðŸ’šthe entire Acure line of products!! This Argan oil I use on my hair which is long and processed blonde. Absorbs without being greasy and leaves the cuticle smooth and shiny. I adore the seriously firming facial oil by this company and will never be without it. Because of Acure my skin and hair are gorgeous. The price for the level of quality cannot be beat. No extra unnecessary ingredients either. Pure and organic. I have the clarifying body wash and the facial wash and I love them both. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> The Oil is very good, and express was very efficient!</li>
            <li> This oil is my go-to for the dry winter air in Utah.  It doesn&#x27;t make me break out, but improves the look of my skin.  Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my face, around my eyes and on my cuticles.</li>
            <li> My skin type:&lt;br /&gt;- Hormonal/cystic acne&lt;br /&gt;- A lot of hyper pigmentation&lt;br /&gt;- Sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;- Fair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Retin-A as prescribed by my dermatologist. She wanted me to test out a new product (EpiDuo) which is a retinol with benzoyl peroxide. I hadn&#x27;t use anything so harsh in quite a while and my skin was extra sensitive since I had been using Retin-A. It thins your skin and you have to be a lot more careful about sun-exposure, etc. Needless to say, the Rx sample gave me a chemical burn. I couldn&#x27;t use any of my normal products which are all formulated for sensitive skin. I had a bottle of Acure Organics Argan Facial Oil in my cupboard that I actually bought for my hair but was too scared to use it on my face since I breakout so easily. I was desperate and my face needing something moisturizing, inert, anti-inflammatory and wouldn&#x27;t break me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was exactly what I needed and I haven&#x27;t looked back. I use a meager 2 drops every night before I apply Retin-A or up to 4 drops when my skin is extra-dry. I also use a drop or two when my hands/cuticles are dry and on my hair to help tame frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are considering a cheaper Argan Oil, I would stick with this brand. My boyfriends mom gave me a bottle of an off-brand that wasn&#x27;t organic. I used it for 2 days and started breaking out. Now I just use that one for my hair and stick to the organic for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Amazon is great source.  A bottle can often go for $17 at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> Helps my acne and rough skin.</li>
            <li> Perfect for spot treatment.  Bottle is small.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this oil my face and hands are really soft and my skin tone is much better</li>
            <li> So far no complaints.  Need to appy it for a longer period of time before I can make a true assessment.</li>
            <li> This oil is simply fabulous! I had my concerns that it might be too heavy. But surprisingly enough it is light and absorbs well.  After using it for only couple of weeks I could see more evenness in my skin tone. And for those who cannot wait for results, it makes your skin very soft after first application. It&#x27;s has no preservatives or additives, it&#x27;s all natural and it&#x27;s all your skin needs. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Looking for  something to  heal  scars on face and  after  doing a  little  reading  about  argan oil thought it was worth trying.  I use a drop or two at night and in the am,  in  moisturizer,  daily and have seen  good  results in a weeks time.  Been very  happy with the two Acure products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Love this oil for my face.</li>
            <li> This multipurpose product can be used underneath your eyes and on other delicate facial skin areas, but I prefer to use it on my very dry, coarse hair.  It seems that most people with very thick hair also have very dry, coarse hair.  Some people, however, have both thick and silky hair.  My sister-in-law and I joke that even my brother&#x27;s gray hair is silky.  Before his hair turned gray, it was a light-to-medium brown color that was very thick, and unlike my sister&#x27;s hair or my hair, very silky, regardless of what brand of shampoos or conditioners he used.  I swam competitively while growing up (absolutely hated it, but that&#x27;s another story for another day), and the chlorinated pool water just compounded my problems with my already dry, wavy hair.  I even had a friend in high school tactfully suggest that I use conditioner (I was faithfully using conditioner, but it didn&#x27;t seem to do much good).  As an adult, I&#x27;ve had my hair highlighted here and there, but have basically left it alone.  So even without chlorinated swimming pools or peroxide highlights, my hair remained dry and damaged looking unless I had it professionally styled at a salon.  I only wash my hair once every other week (I know that that must sound terribly unhygienic!) in order to let the natural oils help my hair look less dry.  Now I have finally found a product that will give my very thick, dry, wavy hair the illusion of silkiness.  If you use too much of this product, then you can overdo it to the point where your hair will actually look oily.  If you use just the right amount, then the results are silky, non-frizzy hair without the help of a professional stylist.  I want to try Acure shampoo and conditioner in the future to see if those products will further help create the illusion of silky hair.</li>
            <li> Thoroughly wonderful for winter use! Face  and neck!</li>
            <li> I love this as a night time moisturizer. I have oily skin and this product does not break me out. I buy this every time I run out and have yet to experience a &amp;#34;foul smelling&amp;#34; one like other users.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to be in a dark glass bottle. Spend a little more on another brand</li>
            <li> PRODUCT.  I USE IT ALL THE TIME FOR FACE, HANDS, ELBOWS &amp; A TINY BIT FOR HAIR!  IT REALLY HELP DRY SKIN.</li>
            <li> This product did not appear to have the same texture as the Josie Marin Argan Oil that I purchased from my local retailer, i will use the remainder of the product since i purchased it, however I will go back to using Josie Marin.</li>
            <li> I love this argan oil. It is less expensive than some other brands, but is just as effective and pure of a product. I use it on my face overnight, primarily. I cut it with jojoba and rose hip oil from time to time to extend its use and to approximate a serum of sorts. I sometimes take a tiny drop, rub it in my hands, and run it through my (very fine, color treated, split end prone) hair after a wash. I like that the glass bottle can be recycled, but I do not know what to do with the pump afterwards other than to toss it, which is a shame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: When using, make sure the bottle is straight upright and catch the bursts in your other hand.</li>
            <li> The Acure certified organic Argan Oil is the most amazing thing I&#x27;ve ever put on my face. I have acne scars and am still prone to break outs in my late 30&#x27;s. The anti-inflammatory properties of the Argan Oil have minimized break outs and if I do get a blemish it generally disappears overnight. My scars appear less dramatic and I have received so many compliments on how good my complexion looks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After years of damage from battling acne I am so grateful for this product. I can tell that my skin is healing and it is also benefiting my neck and chest. I feel soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very dry skin that tends to get extremely oily if I don&#x27;t keep it well moisturized. I&#x27;ve tried a million products for moisturizing at night, and none of them lasted long enough to keep my face from drying out and, as a result, overcompensating with loads of oil by morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff changed all that. Just about four drops on my face at night after a very gentle cleanser, and my skin is fantastic 24 hours a day. My face doesn&#x27;t get oily overnight, and my skin doesn&#x27;t dry out during the day. I haven&#x27;t had a pimple since I started using this stuff (I never got many anyway, but still), and my skin seems to be a little more even in terms of tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend this stuff highly enough! If you&#x27;re looking for a really great, totally natural moisturizer to keep your skin balanced all day long (and help with blemishes and tone), order this product right now!</li>
            <li> I was putting all these harsh chemicals all over my body that my dermatologist prescribed, she would always say i have to wait 2-6 weeks to see results. I have eczema, and the products I was using caused my skin to literally peel off, I know its peeling off all the bad skin, but I was unable to wear makeup, I had red flakey skin all over and I was using my prescribed products for well over a year. After doing much research I decided to give Argan Oil a try, in one night it gave my skin moisture, my acne went down along with my eczema. I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month now and my skin has never looked better! I rarely have to wear foundation because my completion improved! This is a miracle!</li>
            <li> My first time with this oil. Came fresh (no smell) as others complained. Nice oil, using it on my eczema, hair, and nails. So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I never dreamed I would put oil on my skin, as it is combination oily/dry.  However, argan oil has absolutely changed my entire routine.  I apply it directly to my skin--face, neck, hands, wherever.  I also use a few drops in organic leave-in conditioner for my hair.  It is non-greasy, leaves no residue or excess oily spots.  Skin is noticeably softer &amp; smooth.&lt;br /&gt;You will love this item!</li>
            <li> Great oil. Wrinkles disappeared in a couple days.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace my moisturizer but it leaves my skin dry and flaky in some areas, even with daily use for over a week. This product has an unpleasant smell also. The product doesn&#x27;t expire for well over a year so I&#x27;m assuming this is just how it smells.</li>
            <li> Skin is hydrated without any adverse effects. I will continue to buy it. The oil I received was fresh and arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> Why does the argan oil I use in my hair smell like a vacation, and this smells like a dirty diaper?! I had to go rewash my face to get rid of the stench, I couldn&#x27;t sleep! I wish I didn&#x27;t throw out the package, this would be going back!</li>
            <li> This smelled like horse poo...:( so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling wonderful.</li>
            <li> Not sure if all argan oils are stinky but this one smells really bad, like rancid. The first one I bought didnt, the second and third smelled so bad I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> Great product and it arrived fast!</li>
            <li> Smells good and makes my skin glow.  I have used it in my hair and noticed it does soften the ends.&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin and it does not add to my breakouts. Winner!!</li>
            <li> This Acure Argan oil caused tiny red bumps all over my face after only a couple of days using it, so basically a rash or an allergic reaction. As soon as I stopped using it and went back to my usual moisturizer my skin cleared up. I wonder if the problem is what several others have mentioned that the oil is in a clear bottle and that causes it to go bad so quickly and that&#x27;s why my skin had a bad reaction. I&#x27;ve noticed that quality Argan oil is always sold in darker bottles to maintain the integrity of the products, but I&#x27;m sure those brands are probably more expensive. Either way, it&#x27;s misleading for Acure to label this oil as being suitable for all skin types and I certainly would not recommend it for sensitive skins.</li>
            <li> I am using this on my elbows and face.  I haven&#x27;t seen any difference yet, however, I like how it feels when I am applying it.  Also, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I do not understand why you would choose to pay for expense face lotions when a few drops of this oil massaged into skin nightly is all you&#x27;ll ever need for beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this everyday on this beard!</li>
            <li> Yet, another great product... I no longer buy the $20 face creams from L&#x27;Or&amp;eacute;al.... This just took is place!  Best moisturizer and not at all greasy! I use it daily... Morning and night.</li>
            <li> A friend turned me on this and I am a happy Argan oil user.  After I apply it to my face, I&#x27;ll often put some in my hair as well - a nice &#x27;gloss&#x27; alternative.  If my face is particularly dry, I put the argan oil under my face cream - best!</li>
            <li> Been using this a couple weeks now, and my skin feels smooth and soft, I completely went off other moisturizers to make sure it was this product and not a combination of other factors.  True, I use a salicylic wash, and Retin A at night (which is my routine for the past 10 years), but as a moisturizer, this works wonderfully :)</li>
            <li> Pure argan oil  absorbs quickly into the skin and provides great benefits.  Unscented.  Arrived quickly, nicely packaged. Would buy again!</li>
            <li> I use this on my face daily and it works great. Very light and non greasy feeling. One of the few brands I could find that was 100% Arran oil as well.</li>
            <li> I used another organic Argan oil before, with not nearly as good results. I have very sensitive, acne prone combination skin that usually breaks out from just about everything. This has made my skin smoother, with smaller pores, softer and less acne. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 22 and I have really sensitive skin, most products break me out, and if they don&#x27;t, my skin is begging for moisture. I&#x27;ve always considered my skin high-maintenance because I&#x27;ve had (short-lived) \\&quot;success\\&quot; with products that are expensive and over-rated, which after about a month or 2, just stop moisturizing my skin.&lt;br /&gt;So out of frustration for wasting money on produts, recently I&#x27;ve become more curious about what is actually in my \\&quot;beloved\\&quot; expensive face lotions; did my own research, to find that they&#x27;re loaded with synthetic ingredients, silicones and other plastics (the fact is that advertising as \\&quot;natural\\&quot;, \\&quot;mineral\\&quot; and \\&quot;free of fragrances and parabens\\&quot; means nothing in the cosmetic and skin-care industry, there&#x27;s plenty of other fake, filler crap to throw in your product). These types of ingredients wreak havoc on those of us with sensitive skin, and also cause build up under the surface of skin, making it harder and harder for moisturizers to penetrate. So obviously, wanting to treat my skin better, I decided to research more simple, organic, natural, and healthier ways to moisturize my skin. I&#x27;ve tried jojoba oil and that was okay, just didn&#x27;t leave the nice moisturizing effect for long, like argan does. I was a little skeptical of this stuff at first, but after researching and reading so many reviews, I decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m so glad I did! My skin is so velvety and free of breakouts. Doesn&#x27;t feel oily either.&lt;br /&gt;I know an ounce doesn&#x27;t sound like a lot, but with the dropper, and only needing about 3 drops, this will last a while, and save me lots of money! I want to try using this on my hair, and just as an all over body lotion! It&#x27;s great and my skin approves! I&#x27;m using this with an alcohol-free witch hazel toner, and it&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure why others have such problems with the smell. Sure, it doesn&#x27;t smell like strawberries, but it&#x27;s not too strong and goes away after you put it on. It&#x27;s not even that bad to begin with, and youget used to the slight earthy smell.&lt;br /&gt;Will never go back to expensive, silicone-ridden products again!&lt;br /&gt;I was also born with a small broken blood-vessel area on the bridge of my nose, and it&#x27;s fading! (Been using this stuff for about a week now.) Very pleased! Purchasing again! Thank you, Acure!</li>
            <li> 24 F w/ mild acne scars/redness.&lt;br /&gt;This the ONLY moisturizing product I use on my face because anything else makes me break out! This stuff causes zero breakouts and if used sparingly does not leave your skin feeling greasy. I have been without it for 2 weeks and boy can you tell... my skin has little pimples everywhere and its just not &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; like it usually does.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve definitely noticed that it has decreased the scarring and redness on my face as well.&lt;br /&gt;All around a great product. I usually don&#x27;t leave reviews but had to for this because its made such a big difference on my skin.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin GLOW!! I put this on at night, and when I wake up in the morning I have such supple skin! Even my friends noticed when I use this! I usually use a mosturizer with SPF during the day, and this when I&#x27;m not going to be wearing any oily makeup that might interact with this and at night. I showed this to my little sister and she swears by it and uses it both day and night. Its also great knowing that I am putting natural stuff on my face and not all the nasty ingredients that could be in expensive moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy another nighttime moisturizer again. This is sticking with me for life.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff; I really have seen a significant improvement in my skinâ€™s dryness and lines. The smell is ok. The oil itself absorbs well, and is not greasy or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the pump. Itâ€™s not a smooth pump when you want to dispense the oil. It sticks and then the oil shoots everywhere. Iâ€™ve tried doing it more slowly, but it doesnâ€™t help much. Might just be my bottle, though.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to use on my skin and it made me break out terribly.  I am going to try it on my hair and cuticles and see how it works for that.</li>
            <li> I liked this. Put it on my face at night.. I have sensitive, oily acne prone skin that gets dry, flaky from treatments. This does not irritate my skin or aggravate me acne. Leaves it soft and smooth. Did not notice a bad odor that others have complained of. More of a natural earthy smell, not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!!!!</li>
            <li> This oil is not too oily; does not cause break outs.  I think it has helped my skin tone and moisturizes.  I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but I just had to with this product. I received a sample of the Acure argan oil a while back and just started using it two weeks ago as my usual skincare regiment wasn&#x27;t working anymore (dry, broke out and red splotchy skin). I can see a HUGE improvement in my skin. The annoying red broken blood vessel splotches on my cheeks have gone down almost completely and the tone and appearance of my skin has improved significantly. Even my husband noticed. It&#x27;s only been two weeks but I am hooked. Especially since this costs under $15. Craziness.</li>
            <li> It cam just as described. I think it is great! really helps with acne. I recommend this product very highly!</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin and this stuff really helps. And the best part is it doesn&#x27;t make me break out like everything else seems too.</li>
            <li> Loved this from the start. A great night treatment for skin. Reduces fine lines, adds clarity. I will buy more of this.</li>
            <li> I have spent lots of money of good quality moisturizers.  But about a year or two ago, I decided to start washing my face with coconut oil and using Argan oil as my moisturizer.  I have very sensitive and dry skin with some redness.  This regimen has been THE BEST one I have ever used.  My face is so moisturized and the redness is the most subtle it has ever been.  It soaks into your skin enough that you can put your make up on after using it and your make up will stay on just fine.  I usually put it on and then wait about 10 minutes before I put my make up on but it does not feel greasy.</li>
            <li> Great product. I use this in the winter under my daily moisturizer because I live in a cold, dry, urban area and a moisturizer alone isn&#x27;t enough. This is also organic and cheaper than the name brand ones at Sephora by the ounce.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately all three bottles that I ordered had gone rancid.</li>
            <li> I have found the product to be excellent on my face and hands for eliminating dry skin. I am on chemotherapy and my hands and face had been extremely dry but the Argan oil solved the problem and moisturized my skin. I had purchased the Savannh&#x27;s Argon Oil but found it too runny compared to the Acure Organics product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  You don&#x27;t even have to buy acure argan oil but any kind that is 100% organic argan oil and there are quite a few out there.  It does not feel greasy at all, your skin soaks it up.  I use it on my face (does not cause breakouts and maybe even helps acne), my hands, feet, legs.  It is also great on hair.  Just a drop or 2 on your hand then rub into your ends either wet or dry.  Really makes hair soft, feels healthier.  I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love Argan oil. I&#x27;ve tried 3 other brands and Acure is the best. It&#x27;s thicker than most.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on oily looking, but soaks in soon and then you have smooth beautiful skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year and I have much younger looking skin.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand why Amazon still has the expensive price. A year ago Acure sold their oil for $29, now it&#x27;s $15 other places for some reason, $15 at Whole Foods and Vitamin cottage. I love it so much I&#x27;d pay a lot more for it, but glad the price is much less now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have bangs, keep in mind the oil might still be on your forehead and get your hair greasy. This has happened to me many times, but I&#x27;ve learned to use the back of my hand to wipe off excess oil there before combing my bangs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I do is put it on heavy at night before I go to bed and my skin looks perfect in the  morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the summer I have \\&quot;age spots\\&quot;, this has not gotten rid of the spots, or blotchiness. I&#x27;m not sure it claims that, and not sure how an oil like this would. Just so you know that didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it, you will love it. If you tried the other brands, try Acure, it&#x27;s so much better.</li>
            <li> This is the only argan oil that I&#x27;ve purchased before, but I intend to stick with this one. It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling smooth. The oil has worked wonders on my cuticles and a few small scars on my hands. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Fell in love with this oil!! I use it in combination with other products and it has done amazingly well. At first it has a strange scent, but I&#x27;m starting to see that&#x27;s just what Argan oil smells like. I switched to this from the Emu oil since the Emu oil wasn&#x27;t doing much for my skin anymore, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. If you use a small pea amount it will absorb into your skin without the oily look, but if you use more of a dime size amount then it will mostly sit on the skin for a while. So far it hasn&#x27;t clogged my pores, and I only use it at night along with witch hazel toner, AHA souffle, and hyaluronic acid. That combo has made my skin super soft, and supple. I don&#x27;t think I will be changing that routine anytime soon. Not sure if mentioning that I also use Koji San soap makes a difference.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I bought Argan oil and this literally smells like diarrhea. I&#x27;m not exaggerating when I say this. It smells like crap. Really.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil because I heard that it serves as a non-greasy, natural and organic moisturizer. I&#x27;m living in a cold climate which makes my skin very dry and irritable, and cold temperatures combined with windchill result in peeling, red and chapped skin. This oil is supposed to be nourishing without being greasy. I found it to not be too greasy, but after using it for about two weeks i didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my skin. Also, it smells terrible. Some of the other reviews characterized it as a sweet, nutty smell, but mine smelled rancid, like rotten nuts or briny olives. This smell is really distracting and makes me not want to use the product. Also, after purchasing the oil, I read that high-quality argan oil should come in a dark blue or black glass bottle, because exposure to light causes the oil to go bad. That may be why mine smells bad... would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I was slow to come around to using Argan oil for the first time, so I am a latecomer to the party. Not sure which of the Acure products to give the most credit to: the Argan Oil, the Brightening Facial Scrub or the Facial Cleansing Creme. The combined use of the three has drastically improved the look, texture and glow of my skin in the last three weeks. The Argan oil works best for me when I apply it to my face, neck and chest directly after cleansing at night. The following morning, I just splash with alternating cold and warm water and blot my face dry before applying tinted mineral moisturizer and powder. I have normal skin that can get slightly oily during the day so this routine is working great for this time of year.</li>
            <li> I love this oil, it&#x27;s amazing! I can use it on my dry skin and on my child&#x27;s face. Works wonders</li>
            <li> I bought this from a Whole Foods store, so not Amazon this time. My first time purchasing. I love the oil. The consistency is perfect in that it is not too thin, and rubs right into the skin. I love the satiny way my skin looks when using it. I use it on my neck and arms. BUT, WHY??? WHY WHY WHY? There are too many companies that choose the WORST bottles, dispensers!! I spend all this money on a product, just to be unable to get some out of the bottle and onto my skin, and no matter HOW gently I press the dispenser, the damn thing shoots out oil all over the counter. So now, in order to solve this problem, every time I use it, I have to unscrew the frickin&#x27; top, and use the plastic hose part of the top that extends down into the oil, to wipe the oil on my skin. Seriously Acure! Did you even TRY this bottle before buying tens of thousands of them??!! Whoever is in charge of purchasing the bottles in your company needs to be fired! A great oil, but completely crappy dispensing mechanism. I want to make it clear too, that this doesn&#x27;t seem to be a problem with some sort of defectiveness in one unit, but in the fundamental way these are made. In protest, I&#x27;m going to try other Argan oils to try to find BOTH an oil I love and someone who actually spent some time trying to think of the customer who is trying to use the damn bottle so they don&#x27;t wind up with oil all over the place. Geez.</li>
            <li> Great for every day use. I would give it five stars if it had sunscreen.</li>
            <li> good product  work as expected</li>
            <li> This leaves your skin soft and supple not oily as I would have thought.  I would recommend this product to help improve skin texture</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. I just turned 30 and was getting a few lines on my forehead. I used this oil 1 time before bed and the lines were gone. I have been using it for about a week and I love the results. This is going to be a must have for me. I am excited to try their other products.</li>
            <li> I have very oily acne prone skin and I was desperate to find something that would help. I read about argan oil and decided to give it a try. Let me just tell you.. I have not had one zit since using it, I am amazed! My skin looks beautiful and it&#x27;s not oily at all anymore, I can go all throughout the day without having to blot. Also my acne scars are almost invisible. This is an amazing product and I wish I had found it sooner! Plus the price is hard to beat!</li>
            <li> It feels good.  It seems to do a good job of moisturizing.  Its the only one i have tried as far as Argan Oil so i don&#x27;t know if its the best.</li>
            <li> I have been using the argan oil for years now. this one spells different from the authentic one. I wonder whether it is the authentic Argan oil.</li>
            <li> Fabulous stuff. I put it on every night before I go to bed and I wake up to a softer face. I like it. I do sometimes put a little on during the day too. I also put it in my hair.. great stuff.. this is totally LIQUID GOLD!!</li>
            <li> This is the second bottle of this oil, it is fabulous!! I apply it nightly to my cleansed face and neck. It absorbs evenly and my skin has never been better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind this oil.  It feels nice on my face and absorbs quickly.  However it smells horrible.  To be honest it smells like manure!  Luckily the smell dissipates quickly but if I still had the box I&#x27;d return it.  I can&#x27;t imagine it&#x27;s supposed to be like this.</li>
            <li> This Argan oil is very nice, great for keeping winter skin protected and it was a much more affordable price than some of the leading brands.  Same quality!</li>
            <li> Every one in my family is obsessed with Acure Argan oil.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle.  Love it for my mature skin.  Absorbs into my skin nicely.  I use it under my nighttime moisturizer.  Like the results!</li>
            <li> Moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t clog pores. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s prob good stuff, but beware it is extremely greasy on your face , and the smell is strong and pretty horrific .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few products by Acure and have never been disappointed. I use the argan oil not only for my skin by my hair as well. Leaves my hair healthy, shinny without any other products.</li>
            <li> It definitely has an unpleasant odor and I am usually not very picky with the way things smell. It is also a lot thicker or &amp;#34;greasier&amp;#34; than other Argan oils that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Wife likes the stuff.... all I got.</li>
            <li> Something in this smells so bad I cannot use it. It feels great but the smell has to be masked with some essential oils. What is wrong? I have had argan oil from other companies and it smelled fine.</li>
            <li> This is really nice stuff. I used my moms for a few days and fell in love with it. The feel of it is really nice on your skin. I use it on my face and neck before bed. A little goes farther than you think it will!</li>
            <li> Good price and good product.  No problem with it at all.  Will buy again and its useful.  Thank you for this item</li>
            <li> I really hate to give this product a bad review since I&#x27;m a huge fan of Acure, but this isn&#x27;t a great product. I&#x27;ve used other brands before and wanted an all natural version so tried this. The first time I put it in my wet hair before blow drying (like I always do) and it made it so oily - like I hadn&#x27;t showered in days. I assumed that maybe I just used too much and tried it again today with much less and got the same result. My husband said that I look like a girl from the Robert Palmer video and kept singing the lyrics to &amp;#34;addicted to love.&amp;#34; Funny, but not really the look I&#x27;m going for. My hair is soft but looks so greasy and like it&#x27;s still wet. It might work well for moisturizing skin so I&#x27;ll try that, but this shouldn&#x27;t be used on your hair, which is specifically what I bought it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve used this on my face - winter air is dry and I keep getting sick so my face was roughed up from blowing my nose all the time. It works great for moisturizing my face. While it&#x27;s literally putting oil on my face which tends to already be oily, it somehow doesn&#x27;t look oily. I had a co-worker ask last week if I&#x27;d changed my skin routine because my skin looked really good. I hadn&#x27;t noticed a significant difference in appearance, but she did, so I guess it&#x27;s improving my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m leaving this as a 1 star review since I read only 1 star and 5 star, never 3, and I think it&#x27;s useful to know what it&#x27;s good for and what it&#x27;s not. I&#x27;d still give it 1 star for hair but 5 stars for face.</li>
            <li> Originally I used this brand of argan firming serum (with added beneficial oils). Then I ordered just the pure argan oil. Both are amazing on the skin, feel silky, not greasy, and a little goes a long way. However... the argan oil by itself does not have a pleasant fragrance - the scent reminds me of motor oil. You can&#x27;t go wrong with either product, but this time I&#x27;ll go back to the firming serum with the added oils since it smells so much better.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing. I use it on face, body, and hair. Highly recommended. I love their products, will buy shampoo and condish next.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product but it smelled horribly. I don&#x27;t know if everyone smells like mine or if I was an anomaly,  but if you dislike the smell of poop I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews because lez be real, ain&#x27;t nobody got time for that! But this, trust me ladies (and fellas), you will want to make time for this. This product is AMAZING! A friend of mine recommended it after learning that I used a cheap Target facial moisturizer and my goodness I am so glad I switched over. It does a smell a bit &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; but you&#x27;ll get used to it over time. You don&#x27;t need a lot so the bottle lasts a LONG time and your skin absorbs the oil, regardless of your skin type. Now, granted I have pretty oily, acne-prone skin so I was a bit weary about putting MORE oil on my face but I am so glad I took a risk with this product. Argan oil absorbs pretty well into your skin and it didn&#x27;t make me break out at all. I would recommend buying a good sunscreen (I use MyChelle Sunshield SPF 28, great stuff) because the argan oil is good for moisturizing only and you have to protect your skin. I also use an oil-free primer that has sunscreen, for an extra layer of protection (for oily skin, I would recommend Hourglass Veil Mineral Primer, it makes your skin feel silky smooth and helps against oil buildup).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great product but make sure to use sunscreen over this.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with some of the other reviews... this product does in fact smell funky. It&#x27;s not disgusting but I&#x27;m not able to use it on my face, especially being preggo. I would have to describe it as a musky smell. There&#x27;s no cloudiness or discoloration in the bottle so I have no doubts that it&#x27;s fresh and pure. I think it&#x27;s just the natural scent of the oil. Next time I will purchase their scented oil. I do love the way it feels on my skin though. It&#x27;s not oily or greasy and it soaks right into the skin leaving it feeling smooth and silky. I&#x27;ve been using it on my belly and hips to avoid stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will add that the smell goes away pretty quickly which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> My skin gets soooo dry in the winter.  This was recommended to me by a friend to use over my moisturizer.  It did the trick.  Even in Lake Tahoe snow it kept my face soft and the dryness at bay. Recommend this product for moisture, very little scent, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t agree with this product, or perhaps I just had bad timing: too many blemishes. Either way, I&#x27;ve stopped using it on my face, and have relegated it to elbows, ankles, cuticles and other dry patches.</li>
            <li> I am sure this product should not have such a nauseating smells. Argan oil should be sold in a dark bottle&#x27; this is not. It smells rancid and went right into the trash.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin espically my heels feel real soft. Heals the dried skin.</li>
            <li> This purchase was to replenish my supply.  My friend gave me a bottle of this oil for Christmas.  It is a treatment that shows immediate results.  When I used all she had given me I shopped locally for Argan oil.  I bought some, although it was a different brand.  It did not have the same results.  Now, I have the Acure again and what a difference.  I strongly recommend this product.  If you are even considering it...buy it, you will like it.</li>
            <li> Smells kinda funny at first but goes away after applied. After 2 weeks my skin is significantly less red, less fine lines, less breakouts. Amazing stuff and I will continue to buy again! Use with Acure sensitive skin facial wash.</li>
            <li> Great - especially for the prove .recommend as I&#x27;ve bought facial oils for $60 and they are only slightly better.</li>
            <li> I have been using this at night and I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is not nearly as dry (particularly in winter weather).</li>
            <li> Like the feel of the oil,  but it smells like compost.  I can&#x27;t seem to get past that.  I even added pure jasmine essential oil,  and I still can&#x27;t seem to cover the smell.</li>
            <li> I never thought I&#x27;d be putting oil on my face morning and evening, but the hype sucked me in and I gave it a try...and it&#x27;s GREAT STUFF.  No chemicals, nothing unnatural, just 100% organic argan oil that has managed to erase fine lines and leave my skin feeling soft and smooth, not greasy at all.  Amazing.  I&#x27;ve started giving it as gifts.  You will need a little less in the summer than in the winter, but a bottle lasts a long time.  A great buy and a great product.</li>
            <li> I give it 4 stars because it is in fact a great moisturizer for the face and does the job well. But it does have a slightly odd smell to it. It&#x27;s not super strong and it goes away once you rub it in, but it is weird. You get used to it after you keep using it so it&#x27;s not a huge deal. I would like to find one that smelled a bit more pleasant though. Otherwise, this stuff is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Love this oil I use it on my hands face and hair  a little goes along way blown away by how fast I received it very very pleased</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m new to argan oil &amp; wow is this oil awesome!  it goes on oily but as one reviewer said it will absorb.  let&#x27;s hope this gets me through winter!</li>
            <li> Both my daughter and I use this.  I had to buy another bottle because she used the first one so quickly.  She has acne prone skin and this works well with it.  It works perfect on my winter dry 41 year old skin and wrinkles too.  I wouldn&#x27;t use it under make up since it takes a bit to drink it but I use it every night or when I go make up free.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff! I have terrible combination skin, it&#x27;s oily and dry at the same time with mild acne. I use this in the evening, just two or three drops and it makes my skin feel great!</li>
            <li> I use argan oil on my face.  It works great.  I was a little unsure because I have oily skin on my T zone and it didn&#x27;t seem right putting oil on it.  However, after applying a very small amount and rubbing it in, my skin doesn&#x27;t appear oily.  Instead I see better skin tone and my pores appear smaller.  I also use it on my hands in the winter and it helps with the dryness.  I feel my hands look younger.  It works for me!</li>
            <li> Great oil, perfect for blending with essential oils</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over three weeks and I&#x27;m very happy with it. I have combination skin that is very sensitive and prone to hormonal acne along my jawline. It is VERY hard to find products that work for me. I use this right after the acure facial cleanser for combo to oily skin, these are the only two products I have been using and my skin is looking great. It&#x27;s very soft and glowy. I use it for my face and hands. I tried it on my hair twice but it made my hair too oily. I&#x27;m not upset about that though since I bought it for my face. The only thing I don&#x27;t really like is the smell, it&#x27;s strange, but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it, and I will continue to use it for the results it gives me.</li>
            <li> Upon opening the vial, the smell was obviously rancid. I discovered after some research that argan oil should never be packaged in a clear bottle because light can make it deteriorate. I sent it back for a refund.</li>
            <li> Catching up on reviews. Bought this a while back. It smelled old - and the oil wasn&#x27;t as good as others I&#x27;ve bought. I threw it out.</li>
            <li> Love using this product on my face, neck and chest.  Moisturizes and nourishes your skin - love that it is organic and so healthy!</li>
            <li> Does it have a smell? Yes but I notice that after 10 minutes the smell is gone, no one else can smell it either. It is 100% pure and does go on thick but soaks in fairly quickly. I love the Acure brand!</li>
            <li> This is a really great face oil, very non-irritating, sinks in, imparts a nice glow. And, it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used Argan oil, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I really enjoy this product. I use it in conjunction with coconut oil as a moisturizer and it works well. The scent is very light, and faintly floral, and the oil is easily absorbed. The quality seems to be very good and I would recommend it to someone who is looking to try it for skin, or even hair, moisturizing.</li>
            <li> After buying cheaper brands for about a year I decided to go back to this one.  Nothing has given me that glowing healthy look that I experienced when using this oil in the past.  Yes,  it can be stinky like some people say,  but the smell goes away once I apply it.  Maybe I just got used to it,  maybe I don&#x27;t care because my skin looks awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it by itself at night and in the mornings I apply it before my regular daily lotion.  the results are glowing golden skin.  so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it four stars because of the smell,  which obviously makes it a less than perfect product.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this from Whole Foods but for convenience, I bought it online this time.  The smell is different.  It might be stored in a hot place and the oil has changed. But this is only the 2nd bottle I am using so I am not sure how it should smell like.  It definitely different from the one I bought in store.  Also it seems less effective as the 1st bottle I bought from store.  Though, I threw away the packaging so I don&#x27;t know if the contents are exactly the same.  Though, I have been using it and it didn&#x27;t give me issues or any allergic reactions nor dramatically improving my stretch marks.  So I am rating it OK.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this stuff. In the past, I have been an avid user of expensive face care products but what prompted me to switch was turning 30. My skin chemistry changed and nothing was working anymore. I have been using the Acure Organics Argan Oil for two years and I LOVE IT! I purchased it to use as a moisturizer but have enjoyed other benefits as well.My skin has filled fine lines in and my sunspots have almost disappeared(I had some very dark ones).  The oil is very heavy so I recommend using an organic facial lotion as a carrier substance so you can adjust how much your skin can absorb.</li>
            <li> Bought this product to use as a facial serum. As recommended. Claims to nourish skin and help with acne scarring. This product turns out to. Be, just argan oil that can be use for as a body lotion, hair conditioner etc.... It&#x27;s just argan oil and there nothing special about it. This product is sold for facial use but in the end is everything but that. It also has an awful smell that you don&#x27;t want on your facial. Very disappointed to have spend my money on this so called facial serum.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this.  I have long thick hair that has a lot of wave to it and I wanted a moisturizers and smoothing agent for after blow dry.  This stuff does not smell particularly lovely,  it reminded me of rancid olive oil and it made my hair sticky almost immediately like I had used baby oil or something similar.  I have used leave in oils and pastes before and loved them... but not this one.  I ended up giving the bottle away after trying three times to my daughter...she has long curly hair as well and she pitched it after one use.  Maybe its just our hair type or we got a bad bottle but this was not a good fit for us.</li>
            <li> ever since i moved to new york the dry climate has been torturing my skin - it was dry, flaky, constantly irritated and red. I&#x27;ve been using this argan oil for 4 days or so, and most of the issues i had is gone. my face feels soft, moisturised and is definitely more even-toned now which matters the most to me. it hasnt broken me out yet either. I pop this on my finger, 1 drop in the morning and 2 drops in the night, rub them, and apply it around my nose and the mouth &amp; between eyebrows as they tend to get most dry. I tried 3 drops at night then it felt greasy. if your skin is dry / acne prone / high-pigmentation scarred, def give this a go.</li>
            <li> I was having dry skin and acne issues and can&#x27;t use salicylic acid or anything similar.  I have been using this 2x a day with and without my regular CeraVe moisturizers for a week.  My skin has cleared up and is much less dry and looks much healthier and younger.  It does smell a bit strange, but it isn&#x27;t strong and dissipates once it has been absorbed.</li>
            <li> Smells delicious, just like argan oil should. My skin and hair look and feel great after using this product for some time.</li>
            <li> I am on my first bottle of this and will be buying a second when I run out, which is saying a lot because I usually don&#x27;t re-purchase face products for moisturizing as I haven&#x27;t found anything I loved and that didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. This soaks in very well and I like the scent. Not sure what I can describe it as, just to say that I am very easily offended by smells, and this is a nice, clean and natural smell. I am hoping this oil is good for aging skin, but can&#x27;t tell yet.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin...made even worse by dry, cold weather. Since this is a small bottle, I carry in my handbag and rub it onto my face whenever it&#x27;s feeling super dry. Instant relief!</li>
            <li> Very nice product. I have eczema on my arms and very dry skin. This oil is improving my skin and it feels really soft. I used every day.</li>
            <li> Refinery29 did an entire blog on the best beauty products a few months back, which is where I discovered this AMAZING skincare gem. I have very sensitive, mature skin and this product has become my go-to for daily moisture. All I use now is Simple Micellar water to cleanse, Acure&#x27;s Rose &amp; Red Tea Toner, and this powerhouse oil to seal in moisture. My skin has never been happier, and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Buyer beware!&#x27;n this came rancid and I have to throw it anyway immediately.</li>
            <li> Good product.  It absorbs quickly and does not leave an oily feel on my skin.  I would definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Love, love this product. I&#x27;ve been buying it on Amazon from this vendor for a while. Very well priced. Perfect for keeping your skin moisturized in this freezing cold weather. Very light, non-greasy. And I feel like my skin looks/feels great after.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I use a little in my hair as I have thick, wiry hair that leaves the kids calling me Mufasa. (Yeah, they&#x27;re like that) I also use it on my hands and arms. Great stuff. Smells good too.</li>
            <li> A little too oily, but works perfectly for moisture. I would say to everyone that it is best if you keep it in the box to keep the light away from it.</li>
            <li> Smells terrible.  I sent this back and got a refund</li>
            <li> I use this product almost everyday. It keeps my skin healthy looking and soft!</li>
            <li> great find for dry skin an hair</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Been using it for years with my moisturizer. My skin is happy.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way with this product, and it is incredibly heavy.  I live in CO where the air is very dry and skin shrivels up pretty easily, so for people in my area, this is a must have.  I put a teeny tiny amount on my palm, and rub it very well into my face.  I don&#x27;t know if I would recommend it for someone suffering from acne, but for dry problem skin it&#x27;s been very healing and brightening.  I only put it on after hot showers.  I also had some pretty terrible stretch marks from having a giant baby, and started to apply a few drops to my stomach and rub it in well, wow! My scars are so much less pronounced and smooth.</li>
            <li> Smells weird, makes my skin glow, absorbs easily. It&#x27;s organic and relatively inexpensive. What else could one ask for, really.</li>
            <li> I love argan oil, and have used it for years. This was my first time ordering from Acure Organics, and while I like the oil, I&#x27;m not enjoying the particular smell it has. Almost a rancid smokey smell. It is strange, and I&#x27;m going to return it.</li>
            <li> I really love this oily, I don&#x27;t really know what it does...but it does something to my skin. After applying it to my face at nights you wake up to smooth looking skin.</li>
            <li> I have mixed skin, problems with hormonal acne, and tried lots of different products.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted something without all the chemicals and that was more affordable.&lt;br /&gt;This product has become a staple for my facial care.&lt;br /&gt;Love it as a daily moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Glad I went with this. I use it everyday on my face, I had consistence breakouts that have dissapeared. I use a very small amount after I wash my face at night &amp; in the morning, it rubs in quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. My face feels smooth and moisturized even in the winter when its usually dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The glass packaging is a nice touch and it came on time. I was really impressed by Acure Organics, I&#x27;ll definetly be buying it again in the future my bottle seems to be lasting quite awhile.</li>
            <li> I put this on my face and really like that it absorbs in and is not greasy and the price was really good</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Been using it for years. This brand is the best quaity I have found.</li>
            <li> This is obviously a scam, no argan oil should ever be kept in anything other than a dark glass bottle. True Argan oil, has a light nutty fragrance and the label should only have 100% Argan Oil on the ingredients. Light or plastic bottles degrade the product and it is far too tedious of a product to make for a true company to waste with improper packaging.</li>
            <li> I usually love Acure organics products but this oil STINKS it smells like old tires or something.&lt;br /&gt;I honestly can&#x27;t say anything about how well it works because I just can&#x27;t stand the smell enough to put it on my face or hair.&lt;br /&gt;Only reason I even gave it 3 stars is because their products are usually so good and organic but this product is awful!</li>
            <li> Simply amazing product!  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The wife loves this oil....</li>
            <li> Never in a million years would I think about putting oil on my face. My skin has been so dry this winter. I just started a doctor prescribed medication that is making my dry skin even worse (it was for acne). Ever since I used this, I&#x27;ve been obsessed. Goes on nice and smooth, soaks into the skin and starts healing. I would purchase this over any expensive moisturizer any day of the week. I don&#x27;t like putting 100 chemicals on my face like in most of the creams on the market. This is the real deal, 100% argan oil. I use it day and night. I wait a couple of minutes before I apply makeup but at night I use it generously. Its been 2 week so far and I am a fan and lifetime customer.</li>
            <li> I did like the moisture that this oil gave me, but it also gave me way too many blackheads. I guess it is just not the product for me!</li>
            <li> 29 yr old female, sensitive acne prone skin. This product will change your life. Keeps my acne at bay, tightened my skin, provided youthful glow, helped my skin look and feel young again. Not greasy or oily; absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this oil, I&#x27;ve tried other Argan oil and this one by far is the best!!!! And the little bottle will last you for about 4 months or even more because you just need a small amount I love this product</li>
            <li> this product is really light and hydrating. I can really get on board with an organic/natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Great product! I Wear it after washing my face while it&#x27;s still wet, it is not greasy at all, my skin absorbs everything.  My face use to be very greasy and my pores very big, after starting to use it oil is under control and pores seem to be smaller. Recommend it, I do, to everyone!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Argan oil (for my hair and skin). I have been loyal to Josie Maran Argan oil for quite a while, but its price has me searching for some cheaper alternatives. I picked up this line at a health food store in upstate New York. In short, I love it and I cannot recommend it enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Retin-A and sometimes my skin gets very dry. I also break out very easily and heavy creams are not the best for my skin type. Using anti-blemish products of any kind can often leave your skin dry and irritated.  I have combination oily/dry skin and previously I would never dream of putting oil on my skin. Many women I talk to express the same fears about trying Argan oil. That said, I cannot stress enough how great Argan oil is for moisturizing and does not break me out. While it goes on slightly oily it quickly absorbs and does not leave your skin feeling greasy. You can put this oil on at night and wake up with glowing and hydrated skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have have acne scars and are also prone to break outs,  Argan oil also has anti-inflammatory properties. Incredibly rich in Vitamin E, Essential Fatty Acids, and Proteins, Argan Oil is said to help fight lines, repair imperfections, minimize scars + stretch marks, restore texture, elasticity and tone, and reduce inflammation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acure is a family owned company that makes certified organic personal care products. All products are free from animal testing, parabens, sulfates, phthalates, synthetic fragrances, harmful preservatives and artificial colors. This is the first product I have tried from their line and given the success I will try more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is great at 1oz for about $12-$15. The 1oz size lasts and lasts. I would estimate it will last me 3-4 months depending on how often I use it. This compares to Josie Maran Argan oil at 1.7oz for $48 at Sephora and $37 at some Amazon spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more reviews check out pimples and wrinkles.

            <li> I originally bought this product to use on the ends of my long stick-thin hair, but upon doing some research, I decided to try it on my skin. If you had told me one year ago that my skin would benefit by rubbing oil on it every night, I would have thought you were nuts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acure&#x27;s Argan Oil is truly liquid gold. I have never been so impressed by an organic skin care product. My light scars have dissipated, my skin is dewy and aglow all day long, my skin tone has evened out (which was my main issue), and I hardly break out anymore. Hands down, the best skin health investment I have ever made.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about putting straight oil onto my oily face, but this is a wonderful product.  I don&#x27;t feel oily at all.  It really gives me a glow when I wake in the morning.  Now that its getting colder, I use a little more, but its still soaking in quickly and my makeup wears well over top.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a great product, but the smellâ€¦ I didn&#x27;t like the smell the oil gave, after using it for about 2 times on my face, I stopped using it. I just use it on my cuticles.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd bottle. I use it for my hair and face. My skin type is combination, very prone to acne and sensitive to chemical. I used to have very oily skin...my make up did not stay on at all because of oiliness, but at the same time I saw patches of dry areas on my cheek. After reading about this product I tried it and never looked back! The oil keeps my face moisturized but my face never gets oily. I never break out with this either. This product is truly a life saver!!!</li>
            <li> Since using the oil on face, no more black heads on nose area.</li>
            <li> For the price that cosmetic companies establish for their argan oil and considering that all argan oils are marked as pure 100% argan, this one is the best quality at the lowest price. Sometimes, argan oil has a slight smell of manure. May be because it&#x27;s not cleaned well enough, I don&#x27;t know. But this product is scentless, and is of very high quality. I replace my night cream with it once in a while and wake up with a brighter, soft and fresh-looking skin with some imperfections muted. It helps cure bumps, dark spots, and dry skin. I highly recommend this product! Amazed.</li>
            <li> I am not one to buy expensive miracle products to make you look 10 years younger, etc.  I just want health skin that is soft and if the product hides a few fine lines - all the better!  This product is wonderful.  Its an oil and you expect to end up with an oil slick on your face - not the case.  it absorbs quick and leaves a soft, fresh glow.  I am sure my skin is much healthier for this product. I use mainly around my eyes but also spread to the rest of my face and in areas that are damaged from sun.  I follow with a normal moisturizer.  I highly recommend this prodcut</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from acne since I was 12.  I have tried everything on the market multiple times.  Anything designed for acne would dry my skin out and my face would look worse.  Little did I know I was probably having a reaction to all the chemicals and toxins in these products.  Acure products have changed my life.  Within 24 hours I noticed the inflammation in my skin completely decrease, acne scars began to fade, fine lines disappeared.  I looked 10 years younger.  I have never written a review a for any facial product because I have always been disappointed.  I have almost all of the Acure products and have never been happier.  They are worth the money.  It is so important to look at the chemicals and toxins that you are putting on/in your body as they are absorbed into the skin hence into the blood stream.  Acure Organics Argan oil is at 10!</li>
            <li> I used to use so many products to try to balance sensitive skin, then oily skin, then dry skin, and most of the time all of those issues at once!  My aesthetician recommended finding a basic organic gentle cleanser and getting rid of all other product, and then adding argan oil as a moisturizer.  I thought she was crazy for recommending oil for an oily skin issue.  I gave it a shot and within a week my skin got better.  My skin has been AMAZING for 8 months now, and I will never consider using an expensive product line again.  This is one of those less-is-more situations, for sure.  Here is my skin care routine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;gentle organic cleanser w/ face loofa&lt;br /&gt;dry skin, then pat w/ rose water&lt;br /&gt;massage in about 3-5 drops argan oil&lt;br /&gt;* rose water helps the oil absorb into skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My adult acne (which I&#x27;ve had constantly for the past 12 years) is gone and my skin is perfectly balanced.  1 bottle lasts me a whole season. Love this product!</li>
            <li> This was a replacement order. Make face feel wonderful.</li>
            <li> I just recently bought this product but am not that crazy about it.  It has a lot of vitamin E oil in it which makes my skin break out.  I have used it on my cuticles and think it&#x27;s great but so is olive oil.  Not sure it lives up to what is says.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed by this product.  I have very dry skin in the morning especially in the chin and my jaw area, but since using argan oil problem solved. I love that it is odorless and fast absorbing.</li>
            <li> This facial oil helps to decrease fine lines and wrinkles. It absorbs quickly and does not leave skin feeling oily.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, works great</li>
            <li> The item came fairly quickly but really seemed lacking in the quality area. Would not purchase again, I will have to shell out a few extra bucks to get the real deal.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t use alone, need to mix with the facial cream or lotion. otherwise, my face will feel allergy.</li>
            <li> it is a ok product, make&#x27;s my face breakout and does not seem to help with wrinkles, but is good for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered this when another Argan oil I used went up in price. It&#x27;s good, like all the Acure Organics products I have tired. Good price too.</li>
            <li> I read about it in the Editor&#x27;s Essentials article in Urbanette Magazine (Google it!)&lt;br /&gt;It can be used for body and face moisturizer, makeup removal, hair conditioning, etc. etc. Non-greasy and doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell.</li>
            <li> I use this daily! My skin has cleared a lot with using argan oil. It has healing properties that assist with clearin up acne dark spots etc. I truly love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Acure products for some time now, and they never disappoint.  This oil comes in a pump dispenser that makes it convenient to use.  Pump it gently though to avoid it squirting long range!&lt;br /&gt;With this oil, a little goes a long way.  I an nearly 50 years old, and I use it all over my face.  This is my only moisturizer, and it does the trick, providing all day softness and smoothness to my usually dry skin.  I have rosacea, and this oil does not badly affect this condition.  I have seen slight improvement around my eyes where I had fine lines.  This is no miracle cure, and it does take some time to see any result, but if I run out of it, I can tell after a week or so that I really need to buy more.&lt;br /&gt;This oil is a much better price than your average moisturizer, and it is much more effective.  I used to use creams and lotions by Neutrogena and L&#x27;Oreal, but I have made a permanent switch to Acure argan oil.  The price and the results made all the difference.</li>
            <li> Love it. I use it everyday. My skin is soft and look younger after I use t the product</li>
            <li> I use this oil for everything.  I didn&#x27;t expect that it would work for dark circles, but I&#x27;ve been a wonderful improvement.  Works great on your body and hair too.</li>
            <li> It is good with my husbands dry cracked hands. A little goes a long way. I also put it on my wrinkles,,,,who knows. lol.</li>
            <li> This is the best argan oil out there for this price. I add a few drops to my moisturizer at night and my skin looks and feels amazing! Especially good for people who get dry skin in the winter like I do.</li>
            <li> Terrible smell, smth like rancid butter, even worse, i am afraid it is really &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; or spoilt! i do not live in US so unfortunately, cannot return it :-(((</li>
            <li> So far I like this stuff and I most definitely was going out on a limb trying it. I have had terrible luck with other facial oils like marajuca. I use it to take off my eye makeup (a replacement for the unhealthy baby oil I used to use) and as a facial moisturizer. I am 25 and have hormonal acne that is made much worse with pregnancy. This doesn&#x27;t seem to aggravate it / something almost all other moisturizers seem to do. I have used almost all different kinds of skin care on the market from cheap to expensive and I just keep coming back to acure products. No, they don&#x27;t produce miracles but they are far the most gentle on my skin with the best results. I am always sad after a week of trying something new that I even left behind something I know works so well. So for this product hopping junky I think I&#x27;ve learned my lesson. Stick with acure and keep buying this argan oil.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the natural properties of Argan oil.  I bought this product because it is organic... and am I ever glad I did!  It is an amazing product that I use each night before I go to bed.  Honestly, I use it as my night cream!  It makes my skin smooth and helps with my rosacea too!  I find it unbelievable how smoothly it goes on... and how it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all!  If you&#x27;re looking for a high-quality, organic, Moroccan organ oil, this item is for you!  It also happens to be a terrific price on Amazon.  If you have Prime, you&#x27;ll have this beauty delivered to your doorstop in 2 days.  It&#x27;s a must-have for the cosmetic bag in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I bought this argan oil from a health food store after trying argan oils from different brands in the past. I was excited to use this initially because of the price point and it was USDA organic. However, the oil from this company had a strong manure smell. This is not normal, and it is not the &amp;#34;nutty&amp;#34; smell from argan oil. I am extremely disappointed and would not purchase from this brand again.</li>
            <li> Absolutely pure, fantastic argan oil!! NOT ALL ARGAN OILS ARE CREATED EQUALLY, and this is pure, top grade stuff. PLUS it&#x27;s in glass, which is what I was looking for: I don&#x27;t buy oils in plastic anymore: it shows cheap production and a lack of concern for oil purity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this on face and hands at night: it has a nutty fragrance, absorbs rapidly and feels so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ACURE IS A WINNING COMPANY FOR ITS NATURAL PRODUCTS!!</li>
            <li> I really like this product, but I&#x27;m not sure how to fit it in my skincare regimen.  I have the Daily Oil Control cream from Acure, as well as the night cream, so I&#x27;m not sure where this facial oil should go.  It doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out (in spite of the fact that I have a sensitive complexion), so if I can find a use for it, I will gladly add it to my line-up.</li>
            <li> use it for myself my hubby and even my animals! Almost donee with it already! it was very good for my skin</li>
            <li> A friend told me about Acure Argan Oil and I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 months.  It is soothing, nourishing and soaks in so your face isn&#x27;t shiny.  The price is reasonable, also.</li>
            <li> I just bought this recently, I did a thorough research of Argan oil before get this product and i am so glad i did, i use many pure oils on my face but this one has topped them all, my skin feels like silk and my pores looks smaller, it gives me that dewy glow that im always trying to achieve naturally. Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different argan oils before including a batch my old boss brought back from Israel (that was the best). Something about this oil is off compared to the others I&#x27;ve tried. It feels really thin and stays on top of my skin unlike the others I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This argan oil also has a weird smell. I thought it was just my bottle, but my sister ordered a bottle for herself months after I did and had the same comment about the smell. I decided to use mine to the end because I wanted the dropper for something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d go for another argan oil brand if I were you. Pura is currently my favorite.</li>
            <li> Our local Whole Foods store had the 2oz Acure Argan Oil on sale for $20.24.  So, I purchased a bottle.  Thus far, I&#x27;ve used it on my hands which have been dry during the winter months. It does moisturize but leaves a heavy residue feeling, as if you&#x27;ve put cooking oil on your skin without the greasy feel.  I would think if you&#x27;re going to use it on your hair, you&#x27;d have to use sparingly as it&#x27;ll likely weigh down your hair and give it a &amp;#34;I haven&#x27;t washed my hair in weeks&amp;#34; look.  I&#x27;ll see how this goes over time with use before I decide to buy Argan oil again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product as well as the Watt argan oil.  There is no comparison: the Watt brand is so much better!  This one is supposed to be used on the skin, but it stays very greasy and does not get absorbed, like the Watt does.  I will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> i thought it would smell good but it didnt smell like anything</li>
            <li> This oil made my face red and emphasized the red spots on my face, I would never use it again.</li>
            <li> This is the best oil around. I use it on my face daily. Not greasy, super moisturize. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The smell is awful! I heard conflicting things about the smell--but mine smells like poop. Good thing I live with my brother and cats--the smell fades after two minutes and they don&#x27;t really care.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll edit this and tell you how it&#x27;s going though--I got it for acne scarring, cuticle care and moisturizer!</li>
            <li> my 86 year old mother uses it on her face every day.  She loves it</li>
            <li> Picked this up to use with Dr.Dennis Goss extra strength at home peel because it was the only alcohol-free product I could find. Heard rave reviews about argan oil...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I now know why. This product makes my face so soft and supple, but does not cause breakouts. Best moisturizer Ive ever used on my sensitive combination skin.</li>
            <li> This is 100% Argan OIl. It works great as a replacement for a face moisturizer. No annoying smell either. Good purchase. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> I love this oil, it works well for me.</li>
            <li> This has got to be one of the best kept beauty secrets in the world. I had never even heard of argan oil until a couple weeks ago. After using it for a week, I am impressed. The lines on my face haven&#x27;t really faded yet, but my face feels fantastic. No dryness or itching at all. My face is glowing like I won the lottery. The oil makes my face feel so soft, not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried some in my hair yesterday and my hair feels so soft. I have curly frizzy hair and the oil does a good job taming it. As an experiment, I am testing it on some stretch marks to see what it can do. I&#x27;ll update if I have any success with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may seem like a lot of money, but you literally need 2 drops on your face. This stuff will last a long, long time.</li>
            <li> This argan oil is fine for the price, but I find that it does not absorb as well as Josie Maran (which is more expensive) and sits atop the skin. I also think it is not as thick and feels almost watery. My boyfriend also uses it as beard oil and in his hair, and he is not a huge fan of the scent (which I must admit I have not noticed). All in all, we definitely prefer Josie Maran.</li>
            <li> mostly vitamin E oil ...where is the argan?</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t go a day without using this oil. Nourishing, hydrating and smoothing. Also great for scars, burns, and a dab for your locks before styling.</li>
            <li> This is my second order of the Acure Argan oil and both my daughter and I just LOVE it!!!!  I have  always used good cosmetics, but this stuff is fantastic!!!  During the winter months there is nothing better  : )</li>
            <li> I have been using the Josie Maran argan oil for the past year and love it. But my kid just started preschool so I&#x27;ve been trying to cut expenses dramatically (even non-Harvard feeder preschools are expensive!). I could not understand why this oil was nearly half the price. Both oils have a similar smell (the Josie Maran oil smells a little less nutty), similar viscosity, similar rate of absorption. Given that I cannot ascertain any meaningful difference between the two, I&#x27;ll be buying this oil in the near future. I wish the dropper of the Acure oil was a little more like the JM dropper though - the end is not tapered, but flat, so sometimes a drop or two extra comes out. I usually mix a drop or two in with my morning sunscreen. I haven&#x27;t experienced any break-outs and my skin seems a little smoother. I won&#x27;t say there have been any dramatic changes, but I&#x27;ve noticed that my make-up is easier to apply and I&#x27;ve experienced fewer dry patches. I love that this product has no added chemicals, fragrance, or silicones. I&#x27;m probably just going to start pouring this oil into my old Josie Maran bottle so I can use their (superior) dropper.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a scar/keloid that appeared after I changed my nose piercing. I tried to find out if it was recommended for that but couldn&#x27;t. Everyone else recommended tea tree oil but for some reason it&#x27;s VERY hard to find that where I live. I settled on this which I found at Target - I figured it wouldn&#x27;t make it worse either way. Honestly, three days since I&#x27;ve started using it I&#x27;m happy to see that the keloid is gone! After the first night it had incredibly shrunk. I would certainly recommend it! It&#x27;s a small bottle but it seems like it&#x27;ll last for awhile.</li>
            <li> This oil makes my face feel amazing. I even love the smell. The only thing I don&#x27;t love about it (which made me hover over that 4-star rating) is that is seems to bother my eyes a bit. If it didn&#x27;t, I would use it twice a day. As it is, I have to use it in the morning only, or it seems to get on my pillow and irritate my eyes some. Otherwise, fabulous stuff.</li>
            <li> Great product I usually buy it from mothers.  However this time about 2.00 cheaper on amazon.  I have been using it for several years, great stuff</li>
            <li> This product was too greasy for my skin.</li>
            <li> I initially was using Josie maran argan oil but thought the price was ridiculous after a while. Tried this brand and LOVED it. I&#x27;ve been through a few bottles and i don&#x27;t ever plan on switching! Great price and great quality!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Nice product, but too smelly. Makes skin smooth, helps to dry skin. I used only before bed, just because i don&#x27;t like oily feeling of skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  I&#x27;m a guy who has dry skin issues in the winter, and I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of moisturizing products.  This one works just as well at moisturizing as the synthetic creams do, but is all natural and has added benefits.  When I was a teen I had severe acne.  So now in my mid 20&#x27;s I still have acne scars and the occasional pimple.  While argan oil doesn&#x27;t erase the acne scars, it has definitely made them less noticeable.  It&#x27;s not a miracle transformation, but it moisturizes my skin and makes it look a bit better.  I have also noticed fewer pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply it after I shower to my face, hands, arms, torso, and neck.  The smell is a bit funky.  I would describe it as earthy and nutty.  By no means is it unpleasant as some reviewers have complained about, it just doesn&#x27;t smell like the average fragranced cream.  It also disappears quickly, I smell it when I apply it and then it goes away; the oily feeling also disappears quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil is great for hair too.  Every once and a while at night I massage some oil into my hair and scalp.  Avoid applying it wet hair.  I have definitely noticed my hair looks better, is more manageable (less frizzy), and my scalp flakes less.  I&#x27;ve even used it on slight burns, wounds, and as a massage oil for sore muscles; and it seemed to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the best skin products I&#x27;ve found.  It moisturizes, it improves the condition of your skin, hair, and scalp; and it&#x27;s all natural.  Excellent product with so many benefits and uses.</li>
            <li> smells like leather or horse???  the seriously firming serum was much nicer to use for my face!</li>
            <li> I use this to replace night time lotion and it has completely turned around my skin. I was worried it would make my skin oily, but instead it hydrates my faces like no lotion ever has. I just dab a boy on my palms and rub it on my face and neck after washing each night. My skin looks more vibrant and I have no dry skin (and we live at 7,000 feet!)</li>
            <li> This is my favorite oil thus far.  I have tried many including Josie Maran.  This oil smells good and absorbs wonderfully.  Will purchase again.  I use it on my face, neck, and arms.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I love that it&#x27;s organic. In the middle of the day I remove all my face makeup so I can put more of this on. It makes my skin feel amazing and my face look dewey but not oily. I also apply a small amount to the ends of my hair. I would highly recommend this and will be repurchasing again from this seller if possible, shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product with excellent results that I can see and others see as well.  I recommend this product to anyone wanting younger looking skin.</li>
            <li> I just found out about this great product called Argan oil and I&#x27;ve been buying through QVC but it does get quite pricey there.  Although not the same brand, I ordered this product to try it out.  I don&#x27;t like the smell of it, that&#x27;s the bottom line.  I did not return it only because I find it&#x27;s just a waste of my time.  Instead of throwing it out, I decided to use it for the bottom of my feet, my soles, since I do have some callouses there. It&#x27;s works okay, my soles are becoming smooth, I&#x27;m just hoping my shoes don&#x27;t smell like it.  Yikes!</li>
            <li> oil arrived and was BAD. Smelled HORRIBLE. I have used this before. First bottle was great. Used it all. Second bottle arrived and I have never smelled anything so bad. I researched and found that argan oil should be sold in dark containers. Switched to a different manufacturer and am happy with the oil I received now.</li>
            <li> Awesome!&lt;br /&gt;I love this as a moisturizer for under my eyes . It seems to reduce the fine lines .</li>
            <li> I suffer from acne scars and the beautiful dark circles under my eyes ( 3kids) and this has helped reverse the scars and lighten up the dark spots and circles. It&#x27;s an amazing product that every mommy should have.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful for under the eye moisture.. and clearing up zits. Use it sparingly and the bottle lasts for months. I gave it a 4 because I just bought a new bottle today and it stinks! The first bottle I purchased had no scent at all, and it was clear with a tint of yellow. the new bottle is dark yellow and smells disgusting. I&#x27;m taking it back and contacting Acure directly to find out why.</li>
            <li> Argan oil is a wonderful skin serum, and the Acure brand is organic.</li>
            <li> I use about three to four drops a day in my thick, dry hair.  I blow dry and straighten my hair almost every day, and this oil does a great job keeping my hair looking and feeling healthy.  Does a great job keeping static and fly-aways under control in winter.  One bottle lasts me almost 6 months.</li>
            <li> I have read good things about argan oil, but I had yet to purchase it since I didn&#x27;t think I had a specific need.  I woke up Sunday morning with a dry, itchy, inflamed chin - origin unknown.  I picked up this particular brand at my local grocery and on day 4 (today) all signs of irritation are gone.  I love the simplicity of a 1 ingredient product and hope the other purported benefits are even half true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/13/13 Just a six month update - I still love the stuff.  I use it every day after cleansing as my moisturizer.  And, when I do bother to put on make up, it goes on so smooth and lovely, I feel like I am in a magazine ad.</li>
            <li> I love this oil! I am pregnant and my skin has been super dry. This oil has not caused a breakout and has kept my belly and face moisturized without feeling like an oil slick.</li>
            <li> This is very affordable for argan oil.  And it&#x27;s pure.  There are no silicones, fragrances, dyes, etc. added to it.  (It also doesn&#x27;t have preservatives, so you would want to keep it at room temperature or below and use within a few months.)  If you are looking to avoid artificial ingredients, this argan oil is a great choice.  (It&#x27;s also highly affordable compared to some more complicated hair treatments on the market.  And you only need to use a little.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although you can apply it to the skin as a moisturizer, etc., I find that my skin doesn&#x27;t agree with oil-based skincare ingredients (though oils like this do a great job for me of removing eye makeup).  But this stuff is wonderful for my hair.  I shampoo and condition every day but the constant exposure to shampoo and water makes my hair actually dry out.  I get some help from a leave-in conditioner, but I turn to hair oils to make up the rest.  This is one of the better hair oils I have used lately.  I actually put it on dry hair (just the length, not the roots, though you will have to experiment to determine what method of application works best for you).  I pump a few pumps out, rub my hands together, and then pat through my hair with a special focus on the ends.  I distribute it more fully with a detangling brush.  You may want to start with fewer pumps -- my hair is waist-length, so I need a lot of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gives my hair a lovely shine and helps combat dryness at the ends of my hair.  If I have tangles (definitely possible, since I go to bed with semi-wet hair and my hair is long), this helps get rid of them, especially at the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ve been very happy with the performance of this product as a hair oil.</li>
            <li> I used some if this at my best friend&#x27;s house after hearing other friends rave about it.  They weren&#x27;t wrong, my skin looks so much better.</li>
            <li> Got this oil after  a sample was given to me.  I like how it helps smooth out my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I love this oil for your face!  I use it every single night.  I typically have dry skin but with this oil, my skin feels soft and moist.  It was especially nice in the winter when the dry air can affect your skin.  I love it!</li>
            <li> The skin around my eyes looks younger.  This product is pure argan oil; no chemicals. It can be used for hair too.</li>
            <li> I had heard about argan oil on a home shopping network program and wanted to try it, but the advertised price was rather expensive.  So I researched it on Amazon and ordered Acure Moroccan Argan Oil.  I am now on my second bottle, and have to say I wouldn&#x27;t want to live without it in my facial skincare routine.  A few drops at night after cleansing are all you need for soft, smooth, glowing skin in the morning.  Definitely give this one a try!</li>
            <li> I like this product very much and it is very close to meeting the standards of expensive products such as Este Lauder and Shiseido.  The new pump sprayer was an excellent idea for your product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Acure on my face, when I am in the shower, I mix it with my soap, and at times when my hair is a little dry, I have mixed it with my shampoo and conditioner to give my hair it extra moisture and shine without dreading it getting too oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlotte Glenn</li>
            <li> I use it after I mist rose water on my skin,while its still wet,for deeper penetration,it makes my skin silky smooth.  I also use a couple of drops on my hair to make it shine.  I even put it on my eczema to calm it.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh!  My skin broke out almost immediately after using this oil.  I only used it two days, but my skin has not been this pimply since my teen years.  Super duper bummed.  It is two weeks later and one of the pimples is still gigantic!  Do not put on your skin if yo have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any results in my skin. Maybe I am not using it often enough.</li>
            <li> After just one week of using Acure argan oil my mature skin is much smoother, tighter, and lines are diminishing.  I love that this oil absorbs so quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy.  I use it at night and also in the morning under my sheer, natural Dr. Hauschka makeup.  I&#x27;m left with glowing, fresh- looking skin that belies my age. I&#x27;m looking forward to the results after several months usage and this wonderful product will definitely be a permanent part of my skin care regime.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed by this. It came rancid. I had to return it.</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing!  It really soothes and moisturizes your skin.  Is not greasy and feels great!  I can&#x27;t live without this product - great for skin and hair!</li>
            <li> This oil is so moisturizing without being oily or greasy. It absorbs into your skin flawlessly and leaves your skin feeling soft and supple and glowy. I also use it on my hair to control some frizz. The best part about this oil is that it&#x27;s light and fragrance free, making it a great oil to use with other oils - I use it with lavender to put on my face and neck. I&#x27;ve already gone through 2 bottles of this, and though it does last forever, I find myself needing at least 3 pumps to cover my face and neck. A good alternative for someone looking for a facial moisturizer that is not chalk full of chemicals. Definitely a win.</li>
            <li> I received my first order from this brand and it has white stuff floating around. I have used this oil before, but have never seen this. It seems cheap and water down, not thick at all like what some of the reviews said.  Did anyone have this problem too? I am scared to use it so will probably return for a full refund and stick to Josie.</li>
            <li> Found it local store but when I needed a new bottle they were out of it. Great on my face and hands. Best oil I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> This is All you need to use as your moisturizer (day and night), eye cream, neck cream, and primer. Forget about all the other stuff!  My skin feels great, looks great and radiant.  I have very sensitive skin with pores and acne scars.  With the very first use, I saw a huge difference.  It has been about 3 weeks or so and I am loving it! This is not oily on skin but settles right in.  I also love the fact that I&#x27;m putting good product on my face and not break out.  I have to be very careful what I put on my sensitive skin.  This is gentle and perfect!</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil for use on my face to see if it would help with dry skin. When first applied, it felt nice...the tight feeling went away and it wasn&#x27;t overly greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  However, in less than half an hour, it was completely absorbed (hooray to the non-greasy nature of argan oil!), but my face felt tight again (boo to the return of dry skin!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I had to keep reapplying it to get rid of that dry, tight feeling. So, I decided to apply it after patting my face down with water, or after a shower. That worked a little better, but not much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I don&#x27;t find this product to be helpful for dry skin. Perhaps it will do me better in the spring/summer after cleansing since my skin is less dry during that time of year. I also find it works well in hair to tame frizz, but don&#x27;t use too much...certainly better than silicone-based serums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  As far as a wrinkle-fighting oil, I can&#x27;t really comment on that since I don&#x27;t really have that problem....yet. Logic tells me that while it may have good properties for treating such a condition (EFA&#x27;s and vitamin E, etc.), if skin is still dry shortly after use, this increases the likely hood of fine lines, thus being counter-intuitive. Additionally, it would certainly be more effective to consume healthy foods which already contain these beneficial ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything, literally every type of moisturizer, oil, serum etc. Expense, middle of the road, cheap....everything. I stumbled across this product in a local store passing time while waiting for my fianc&amp;eacute; and decided to try it. I tried it for 3 days and it totally changed my complexion. I have always dealt with adult acne prone, combo skin and it literally healed my breakouts in a few days. It is by no means a miracle oil because everything doesn&#x27;t work for everyone but I recommend trying it (for the price you really have nothing to loose)........ it could be the oil you have been waiting for! I also want to respond to the other reviews about the smell.........my oil has no smell and actually smells lovely........I also believe Acure released  this oil infused with different scents along with the original (Rose, Citrus and Coconut) and they all smell very good to me. I use it after washing my face, neck etc. am/pm, it aborbs well and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy (with all oils less is more, I use one pump).  I can&#x27;t say enough how great this is.</li>
            <li> I usually use this product at night time, before removing make up and washing my face, and it leaves my skin well moisturized and a bit glowing in the morning. It is easily absorbable and has no particular smell.</li>
            <li> I am on my third bottle! I use this oil every day all over my face as serum in winter and in summer more under eyes as cream. The oil soaks in the skin and makes the skin more supple. If I could I would buy this for my whole body but I guessing that would cost too much!!!!!!!! I am type a person who loves everything natural not chemicals or parabens. People have to understand that the more chemicals you gonna use the older you gonna look . The body is not made for chemicals check all the people who live in different countries that dont have access  to these expensive chemical products they look better than those who does. All the celebrities who uses those creams at the end always end up with plastic surgery because those creams simply dont work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Such a treat for my hands and face!</li>
            <li> I tried another aragan oils and broke me out horrible I&#x27;m recovering from hyper pigmentation as soon I comeback to this my skin felt it inmedialtely&lt;br /&gt;Love this oil the best</li>
            <li> Is the best oil I have tried on my skin, it does not give you the sticky sensation but instead leave my dry skin beautiful, specially during winter time when it gets dryer.</li>
            <li> GREAT for skin and hair</li>
            <li> I bought mine at Whole foods. I have sensitive combination/oily skin(dark) and I have been using coconut oil for a while. It worked fine, but as it starting to get warmer my skin oilier. I decided to try this argan oil and so far so good. It&#x27;s not too greasy, and makes my face glow...sticking to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this is rotten. It smells like dirty dish water.  I have used argan oil for years,however the first time I have used this brand  and it will be the last!!</li>
            <li> Best oil ever and love the new pump</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of natural products and decided to give this a try. It is not easily absorbed as described. It nurtures skin, but it is not a miraculous formula. Bio Oil is a much better option to keep your skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> I love Argan Oil and had been using Josie Maran&#x27;s Argan Oil.  It helped improve my skin tone and condition.  Even though I have naturally oily/combination skin, the Argan oil actually helped to moisturize my skin while not creating extra oil. I saw that this was much less expensive and decided to give it a try. While it has had the same effects as Josie Maran&#x27;s Argan Oil, it has a very odd and distinct smell to it that Josie Maran&#x27;s oil does not. I will definitely continue to use it and may purchase it again if I can&#x27;t find an alternative.  I can&#x27;t justify paying twice as much for Josie Maran&#x27;s oil even though I don&#x27;t like the smell of this one.</li>
            <li> Not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Smells absolutely horrible.Having not bought Argan Oil before, I didn&#x27;t know the manure smell was wrong and passed any point of return. Argan Oil should be stored in a dark container and this is in a clear one making it go bad - gross. Had to throw it out.</li>
            <li> Love this oil and its price; very high quality oil. This is a must for me in the winter when it&#x27;s dry and cold where I am.  I do put a night cream on after I let the oil sink in for a few minutes. I wake up with soft, plump skin.</li>
            <li> I put the oil on my face before I put my make up on.  It is wonderful.  It makes my face feel and look more youthful.  I am 68 years old and if the oil can make my face look more youthful everyone of all ages should use it.  It is an oil but the skin just absorbs it and there is no greasy feel after you rub in into the skin.  I love this oil and.  I do recommend the ACURE brand.  I did some research on line and this seems to be the best oil and does not cost as much as some of the other oils.</li>
            <li> Really great stuff! Love that its organic and helps keep wrinkles at bay!</li>
            <li> A great oil. Nice packaging.</li>
            <li> Bad smell! can&#x27;t even use it!</li>
            <li> I know there are a lot of great benefits to using argan oil, it&#x27;s just too oily for me. My sister on the other hand loves it. I prefer JoJoba oil over argan oil.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but thought for this price....why not.  I hve extremely dry sensitive skin and this product is great.</li>
