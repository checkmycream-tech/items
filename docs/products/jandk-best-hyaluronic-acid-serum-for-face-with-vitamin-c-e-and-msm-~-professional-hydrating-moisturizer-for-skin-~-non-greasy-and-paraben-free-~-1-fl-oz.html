            <li>and I have noticed visible improvement on expression lines, for a week I am using in combination with Joy &amp; Karma&#x27;s Vit C Serum</li>
            <li>This serum works great.</li>
            <li>I also use the Joy and Karma Vitamin C serum and swap between the two.</li>

            <li>Since you put moisturizer on after, this is a good plus.</li>
            <li>i can already see good result</li>
            <li>Skin feels good with it</li>
            <li>Good choice...</li>
            <li>Good acid serum..</li>
            <li>good</li>
            <li>I liked the Joy &amp; Karma Vitamin C serum, so when I was given the opportunity to purchase the Joy &amp; Karma Hyaluronic Acid Serum at a promotional price, I was happy to be able to try the two products together and share my experiences.  </li>
            <li>It feels good on the skin and pairs well with my moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It feels so good and can tell it makes my face look healthier.</li>
            <li>good price, thank you</li>
            <li>So I recommend the company, but the product wasn&#x27;t good for me.  </li>
            <li>good price good product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a good girl and feel that I deserve some good karma.</li>
            <li>Good moisturizer than anyone...</li>
            <li>Boxed looks good.</li>
            <li>I have to use good moisturizers to cure it.</li>
            <li>Theses products aré verry good.</li>
            <li>so I could give this a fair review.  </li>
            <li>Despite all the good reviews, this product just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>and I am good to go.</li>
            <li>No skin problems too good</li>
            <li>Just as good as the Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li>Feels so good on my face</li>
            <li>So I would not be a good person to review for improvement of wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I am comparing it to the one that I absolutely loved so I may be biased.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Packaging: The packaging was good.</li>
            <li>Would be good for someone with dryer skin.</li>
            <li>Smooths out the skin on my face and works really good with my moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I tried this for a couple of weeks and loved the way it went on my skin.</li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>

            <li>Many creams and serums burn but this is very gentle and feels great on.</li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t know if its just my unique experience</li>
            <li>Another great aspect is that this serum is made of a large percentage of natural and organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>Most hyaluronic products are mixed in some kind of creme.</li>

            <li>Goes on smoothly &amp; absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>So great for dry saggy skin.</li>

            <li>this stuff is great, i use it every day, its really helped my skin clear up</li>

            <li>I love that they are natural and mostly organic.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Has a pleasant smell and extends on your face very smoothly in a second.</li>

            <li>After a hot shower and good facial cleansing, I put this on at night love the way my skin feels afterwards.</li>
            <li>For someone that has oily / sensitive skin, there have been zero problems (and I probably used way more than I should!)</li>
            <li>now I don&#x27;t notice the fine wrinkles when I smile.</li>
            <li>I loved that it didn&#x27;t leave a film or residue like most other serums I have tried, that speaks volumes about this product</li>
            <li>The product is light, gives great coverage, and sinks into the skin quickly without leaving a sticky or tacky residue.</li>
            <li>Nothing special about this serum.</li>
            <li>SPECIAL.</li>
            <li>Trust me I will buy again even without special.</li>
            <li>You can feel your skin tighten right after putting it on!</li>
            <li>I love hyaluronic acid serums because they work so well, are extremely gentle, help lighten dark spots, most effective at treating eczema on my baby&#x27;s skin, is very clean with no residue, doesn&#x27;t clog pores and doesn&#x27;t have any smell.  </li>
            <li>I have seen a difference in the look of my fine lines and wrinkles, (Deep cracks and Crevices) since using the Best Hyaluranic Acid Serum Facial Moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and I was impressed and its hard to impress me.</li>
            <li>I have never in my life been able to have a clear, hydrated, and healthy looking face until now, and when i started this 2 weeks ago my face was completely dry and flaky and i had several hormone related acne spots, after ordering DHEA 50mg along with the Best Hyaluronic Acid Serum + the Vitamin C serum by Joy and Karma.</li>
            <li>...anyways, this stuff is awesome and the price is hard to beat.</li>
            <li>First, it goes on very smoothly and easily and absorbs almost as fast as you put it on.  </li>
            <li>I used Joy and Karma&#x27;s vitamin C and really did not notice a big change in my skin, but once I added the hyaluronic acid serum I seen a huge difference in just three days...</li>
            <li>As a woman on the fast train to the age of 43, I am always looking for great products for my face to keep it looking fresh and young.</li>
            <li>Light weight and easily absorbed.</li>
            <li>I love the product, it absorbs fast and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky.</li>
            <li>a lot more elastic, supple like a plumbed bean and in addition, it became very hydrated.</li>
            <li>that I would or could  pay full price.......</li>
            <li>shared this serum with my Mom, just to have a true way to see the change without combining serums on me.</li>
            <li>First of all ordering through Amazon was a good experience, the serum arrived pretty fast.</li>
            <li>One recommendation would be if J&amp;K gave more of a guideline about how much to use.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t use that many face products just a face wash and some face lotion</li>
            <li>My wrinkles have not disappeared but they are much finer and my skin looks significantly better.</li>
            <li>I love how this product feels going on and my face feels much softer and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>Highly recommended! :)</li>
            <li>no difference after full 45 days with lines or wrinkles</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a good hyaluronic acid serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I Received this product free along with the vitamin C and and I really did see a difference with the fine lines and the races around my mouth and under my neck, I recommend getting both products ..</li>
            <li>These are a great alternative to those other chemical laden products.</li>
            <li>My face finally looks BEAUTIFUL, and what&#x27;s funny is the dryness went away after my first use.</li>
            <li>In the first week of using, the fine lines on my face are almost gone.</li>
            <li>I also like the way it smells so fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>It absorbs into your skin quickly so you can put your moisturizer on.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly asks i can wear it under moisturizer and make up.</li>
            <li>I used it all and then tried one of the big name brands that costs 3 times as much and promises great results.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, and my skin feels hydrated.</li>
            <li>the delivery was quick</li>
            <li>but it absorbs quite quickly</li>
            <li>I was not expecting to notice any difference so quickly.</li>
            <li>Quick drying</li>
            <li>I love the feel of this serum, it goes on smooth and it makes my makeup look professional</li>
            <li>MY ACNE SCARS HAVE LIGHTENED UP TREMENDOUSLY.</li>
            <li>This gel dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>I appreciate the quick delivery and do like the consistency of the product.  </li>
            <li>You can look several years younger with faithful application of this awesome product.</li>
            <li>I just love this serum, I have been looking for such a produst for a long time and believe that good things come to those who wait!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a moisturizer that helps smooth and tighten!</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve waiting a few weeks to write this review because I wanted to give this product a good test drive, and I feel like i&#x27;ve had enough time using it to give my honest opinion, and let me say I am in love.</li>
            <li>One of my new favorite serums</li>
            <li>My skin is super soft and the fine lines are fading!</li>
            <li>This feels really good on my skin and keeps it from being as dry.</li>
            <li>so i was skeptic about the easy speadablity and the absorbing of it</li>
            <li>OK, I waited a while to write this review, because I wanted to really try this product first.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have seen zero issues with this product and love the way it makes my skin feel and look.</li>

            <li>First thing I loved about this was that its 98% natural and 72% organic next thing was the fact it wasn&#x27;t runny most serums</li>
            <li>My skin looks very smooth and clear.</li>
            <li>Very light serum with a soft scent.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell if it makes a difference in the fine lines yet.  </li>
            <li>product has been very helpful at plumping up my skin and reducing the fine lines on my face.</li>
            <li>not JK, it went on smooth and absorbed quickly leaving my skin ready for moisturizer.</li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t put much on my face at all except what is mostly organic and pure.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find products that don&#x27;t irritate my skin, but this serum works really well, and the results are great!</li>
            <li>After using the serum for 2 weeks, my skin is so much softer and smooth.</li>
            <li>My face hasn&#x27;t felt smoother and been more clear.</li>

            <li>I really love this Serum, I can really see the difference in my skin after one use, Thanks</li>
            <li>My face looked brighter and more alive</li>
            <li>While a bit of a sceptic of facial products, believing more in the benefits of a healthy diet, ample hydration, exercise, gentle cleansing and a balance between sun and sun protection to keep skin youthful, after reading about the benefits of hyaluronic acid</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is also well absorbed .</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I really love this product and I&#x27;m all about natural.</li>
            <li>and so far I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it do far.</li>
            <li>that along makes it worth using &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m in love wuthering the way it feels and can already notice a difference.</li>
            <li>and this is the first time in over 15 years that she felt confident enough to not wear a face full of foundation/powder and concealer!</li>
            <li>I was right she likes it and said she feel her face more soft.</li>
            <li>It appears that this serum drys out my skin a bit more than other products however, my skin tone and appearance does appear more even.</li>
            <li>This product has given my skin a clear, clean, smooth look.</li>
            <li>It has made my skin feel softer and has noticeably reduced a wrinkle on the right side of my face..</li>
            <li>I got this through a promo and started using it right away.  </li>
            <li>Soaks right in, not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>The consistency is just right</li>
            <li>Received right away.</li>
            <li>I noticed right away a smoothness to my skin and a tighting in the neck area.</li>
            <li>I noticed the difference right away. .</li>
            <li>as someone with thin, sensitive skin I can honestly say that I have never been more pleased with a skin care product!  </li>
            <li>I applied a daily moisturizer, exactly as mentioned in the instructions as the serum is not meant to be used on his own, but in a combination with a day or night cream.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed more elasticity to my skin as well as major wrinkle reduction and pore&#x27;s are minimized as an added bonus its clearing up some hormonal acne.</li>
            <li>This is a great basic facial serum - works well at softening skin - the price was very reasonable!</li>
            <li>Using this has made a huge improvement on my skin, i feel like it feels super soft.</li>
            <li>So far my face continues to be very smooth and it moisturizes very well.  </li>
            <li>I am using this  as my facial moistuizer,goes on silky and smooth has reduces some fine lines</li>
            <li>I have thinning skin under the eye &amp; can really notice that this product lifts &amp; really helps with fine line and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>seems to only work on very fine lines, skin feels oily instead of moisterized</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have experienced no itching, burning, redness or other allergic reactions to this product.</li>
            <li>ITS A VERY NICE PRODUCT, I WILL BE ORDERING IT AGAIN WHEN I RUN OUT, WHICH VERY LITTLE GOES ALONG</li>
            <li>Love this Serum, I really helps my skin feel soft.</li>

            <li>Not enough moisture for dry skin but great for oily skin, absorbs quickly, weightless.</li>
            <li>These were delivered super fast.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;So far I love your product, makes my skin very soft.&amp;#34;  </li>

            <li>Perlabella HA reversed signs of aging and even felt different on my skin that most HA products.  </li>
            <li>It states on the instructions that if you use a toner, to use toner first, then serum and you can apply your moisturizer and makeup over the serum.  </li>
            <li>My skin just drinks it up, and it feels smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to someone who need more moisturizing.</li>
            <li>but it goes fast!</li>
            <li>, it makes my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m 65 years old, finding a product like this is really important.</li>
            <li>thanks!  </li>
            <li>Love all the ingredients of this product and can only recommend it.</li>
            <li>Love the facial serum.</li>
            <li>People have been complimenting me so much!</li>
            <li>I have noticed since I started using it that my skin tone looks more even and definitely clearer.  </li>
            <li>At first I am kinda scared to use this because of the name itself Acid...</li>
            <li>I like this serum so much better than their regular vitamin C serum because of the thickness of the formula.</li>
            <li>Not only has the acne diminished but my skin looks more alive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I mix two drops of each together morning and night as a serum under my moisturizer and after only two weeks my skin is looking better.</li>
            <li>I love this product and week two seen a big difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>They work very well together!</li>
            <li>There are many companies who simply ignore customers who ask a lot of questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>Love these facial moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really seen a difference in my skin!</li>
            <li>Although I did&#x27;t / haven&#x27;t begun to use it consistently</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not taking away any stars because of my negative reaction because I truly don&#x27;t believe the Joy and Karma gel had anything to do with it.  </li>
            <li>Upon first using this, I already noticed a difference in my skin&#x27;s texture.</li>
            <li>I love this serum together with the Vitamin C serum from same company.</li>
            <li>My skin felt so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I have used this several days and love it.</li>
            <li>I used it twice a day for a month and my face felt smoother and looked better overall.</li>
            <li>I really like the way this product made my face and neck feel!</li>
            <li>my skin is not only looking better its softer feeling.  </li>
            <li>I REALLY SEE A DIFFRENCE!   </li>
            <li>My face feels younger and looks better.</li>
            <li>I used this acid first after cleansing then moisturize.</li>
            <li>or maybe its a combination of both ;)</li>
            <li>Its a good serum, and I use it everyday.</li>
            <li>I have fair complexion and some trouble with rosacia on my cheeks, nose, and forehead.</li>
            <li>After that I use pure organic rose petal water and just spray all over my hair and my face and let dry.  </li>
            <li>I am a new user of this stuff-I like that it is mostly organic and natural.  </li>
            <li>Thought this was more pure than it actually is.</li>
            <li>First it is not as watery as the other brand, and it really makes my skin look radiant and supple, love it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&amp;#34;fantastic product - msm - and other ingredients are excellent for the skin - for encouraging collagen and moisturizing with creating black heads etc.</li>
            <li>Fine lines are becoming less noticeable and my skin looks refreshed.</li>
            <li>My skin tone has evened and it&#x27;s noticeably more firm, and I&#x27;ve noticed a huge improvement in the moisture level.  </li>
            <li>I believe in using serums and love the way JK feels, not sticky, dries quickly and sinks in fast.</li>
            <li>I think the bottles would be much safer in their own boxes though, because they easily could have been damaged during the handling process if it was handled by a clumsy postman.</li>
            <li>my skin is more clear and soft</li>
            <li>takes just a drop, applies very easy, my face does not feel dry after applying, always use a night creme after applying, but really like it</li>
            <li>I have dry skin and my skin feels great all day long.</li>
            <li>After 3 days of use with this i noticed a positive difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this three stars because I didn&#x27;t see any positive results in the two months I used it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>and I hope in a long run it will make my skin better...</li>
            <li>The upper lid was becoming droopy, causing me to have to change how I put my eye makeup on, but I think there&#x27;s been some tightening</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t tend to pay that much attention to my looks or keep a consistent regimen.&lt;br</li>
            <li>face is smoother, my skin is not dry and the fine lines are not so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely pleased that you don&#x27;t need to use much, and my first bottle lasted a really long time.</li>
            <li>are just as good, if not better.  </li>
            <li>It works beautifully when I mixed a little with the soy moisturizer I have.</li>
            <li>So after a few weeks I decided to buy myself my own and it has left my skin so nice and soft.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a film like some other serums and my moisturizer glides over it very easily.</li>
            <li>After use, found my skin to be super soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had a mild case of acne (even at 57 years old)</li>
            <li>My facial and neck area looks much more healthy meaning that my skin is not dull, dry and flaky.</li>
            <li>my dark spots are less visible as well, I started using both serums separately, and within a week I started combining them, I am getting better results combining them both, this particular serum smells really nice and leaves your skin so soft, I love the fact that these products are organic, they certainly feel natural, I will most likely purchase again!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using ht for just over 2 weeks and can certainly see a difference in my skin</li>
            <li>I will certainly continue to use and will recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li>It certainly came out of the bottle a bit thicker.</li>
            <li>I have been using this along with the Vit C Serum for a few weeks and my skin is looking better than it has in years!</li>
            <li>my face is more clear and fine lines and wrinkles less noticeable</li>
            <li>Application is easy, however, it does take me a while to work it in my skin (which is the only issue, I really have with it).</li>
            <li>Not only does it help skin retain moisture, but it helps to plump out the skin, minimizing the look of fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>My pores are usually large and my foundation does not go on smooth, after only two of using this</li>
            <li>I first used the serum without moisturizer to see if my face would dry out and while it felt fine, it felt even softer after using moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I noticed a huge improvement in my skin in only two weeks....</li>
            <li>My face and neck are looking so much hetter..</li>
            <li>in just a week my skin feels so much smoother and just nicer.</li>
            <li>I appreciate that it&#x27;s light and not gross feeling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s now so much smoother.</li>
            <li>Just have to say I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT IS VERY NICE,IT MAKES MY SKIN FEEL LIKE SILK.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and seems to absorb well; have only been using it for a couple of weeks.  </li>

            <li>My wrinkly skin is much smoother now and looks well hydrated.</li>
            <li>After using it for two weeks, I can really tell a difference.</li>
            <li>My skin is much softer and smoother than it was.</li>
            <li>I have received comments/questions on what have I done because my complexion is really youthful looking.  </li>
            <li>Very hydrating and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>The real deal.</li>
            <li>I used the whole bottle and didn&#x27;t see any results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not seen much improvement in my skin at all.</li>
            <li>It felt really hydrated.</li>
            <li>-I can feel it absorbing into my skin.</li>
            <li>I am a 63 years woman and although the skin of my face has not deteriorated much I do have the spots and wrinkles that come with aging.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>The backs of my hands look so much smoother and plumper (I&#x27;m 51, and washing dishes by hand had really beaten up my skin).</li>
            <li>I applied to my face and gently patted it in.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t say I have really noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>At 74 I presently am fortunate enough not to have wrinkles</li>
            <li>If anyone wnts to know I am 55 and have health issues so my skin can really use the help.</li>

            <li>Thanks for letting me try this.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone who wants to improve their skin texture at any stage of life.</li>
            <li>It will probably run out 3x as fast as the Hya. Serum.</li>
            <li>This was very comforting.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling fresh and soft.</li>

            <li>Facing 60 this year and really seeing a change in my skin</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Fabulous facial serum!</li>
            <li>very good!!&lt;br /&gt;Skin became moist</li>
            <li>This is so hydrating and really brightens my face.</li>
            <li>After 2 weeks I really could not see much difference.</li>
            <li>I continued to use 2 x day but at this point I really cannot see much difference.</li>
            <li>Again at this point I can not see much difference.</li>
            <li>My face feels so much healthier and looks a lot nicer since I started using it.</li>
            <li>This product was sent to me at a low price in exchange of a review, and I can honestly say I will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li>Not only does my skin look and feel better, but I was also having problems with some adult acne and age spots.</li>
            <li>The only difference I have noted so far is that the Vitamin C side has a more powdery skin feel.</li>
            <li>Good product, slow delivery when faster shipment/receipt was advertised, Thanks,</li>
            <li>All i had to do was find something that was mostly natural and/or organic, I can&#x27;t believe i NEVER thought of that!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also aging early because of (stress) a lot of hydrocortisone use through the years for my eczema and this HELPS!!!</li>
            <li>I have purchased two different kinds Hyaluronic Acid Serum and JK is much well worth the money!</li>
            <li>Not so much a lightening of dark spots, but an overall more smooth appearance.  </li>
            <li>I do see slight improvements with very fine lines I have.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a sensitivity to other skin care products and made sure that I used the Vitamin C for 5 days with out reaction before I added the hyaluronic acid serum</li>
            <li>and I have tried many other brands on the market today.  </li>
            <li>i normally use image hyaluronic serum and that is a higher % but is more expensive- overall good stuff i would order again</li>
            <li>I have been using your serums religiously for the past couple weeks, I love the way it absorbs quickly, my skin looks and feels softer and most importantly younger.</li>
            <li>I am also on a mostly natural kick, so I was very very please with the ingredient list.</li>
            <li>I only paid $1.50 for my bottle, there was a fb special promotion (i think it was on fb).</li>
            <li>It seems to help hold the moisture in pretty well though, given its natural organic ingredients vs chemical ones.</li>
            <li>Did notice a much more noticeable lightening of dark spots on my hands, though.</li>
            <li>The formula did work well in clearing some old scarring when I first used it.</li>
            <li>There is a new hero in town!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product if you would like to have a new GLOW about you face!</li>
            <li>They answered my questions quickly and were helpful regarding uses for their facial serum</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these products for several weeks, and my skin is soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This definitely helped my skin look young and feel smooth.</li>
            <li>my particular skin didn&#x27;t agree with this product.</li>
            <li>I also love how you only need maybe 2 drops for the entire face and neck.</li>
            <li>I have been using for a few days now and my skin all ready looks better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not conclusive since I&#x27;ve changed my hair color, length and style (which impacts the look of your skin drastically, as to get older</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mild enough for me to use day.</li>
            <li>I use mine with the Vitamin C serum to protect my skin from the elements and to minimize signs of aging (after all, just because I am getting older</li>
            <li>It has none of those nasty chemical smells that many serums have; it is very pleasant!</li>
            <li>My face looks shiny and vibrant.</li>
            <li>Love this serum that provides so much moisture to the trouble spots around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment-makes my skin feel soft and hydrated!</li>
            <li>This particular one is a must for my staying young arsenal!!</li>
            <li>High quality too.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a high quality product, and I recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this for every age.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this and the vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommende</li>
            <li>highly recommend both these products.</li>
            <li>I am using this every day along with the viatmin C.I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend</li>
            <li>Works as well as high priced serums from high end department stores.</li>
            <li>Looks high quality.</li>
            <li>absorbs quikley highly recomend</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I love that their products use mostly natural ingredients, I have been looking at hydraulic and C serums but have not bought due to chemicals.</li>
            <li>A little watery compared to most hylauronic acid products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Her skin noticeably changed not long after using it, gaining back some of its natural elasticity and healthy glow.</li>
            <li>much smoother, better skin tone and those little crows feet I have are almost invisible!</li>
            <li>I really like that it is natural, organic and NOT tested on animals.  </li>
            <li>Very well tolerated on my extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only been a short time, but my skin is soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles but the few I have</li>
            <li>Tightens, seems to be building strength in the skin which many products promise and few deliver on..</li>
            <li>During this time, I had no negative skin reaction to the gel at all.  </li>
            <li>Left my skin feeling tightened and fresh.</li>
            <li>Never used before and after a few weeks,  my skin looks clearer and healthier with a more even tone.</li>
            <li>With the really harsh winter weather in New York City, I may need a more emollient serum.</li>
            <li>My skin simply became super sensitive overnight.  </li>
            <li>I apply right after washing and allow several minutes for absorption.  </li>
            <li>manufacturers are sincerely interested in your enjoyment of their product and are invested in your success with it, so nothing I&#x27;ve said is due to any lack of their care and communication.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly, so the sticky feeling is not for long.  </li>
            <li>You will a slight tingle when first using the product but other than that this serum is amazing.</li>
            <li>So far I am very pleased with the results although I&#x27;ve only been using the products for a few days.</li>
            <li>It took a few days before I saw any noticeable difference, but my face felt different (better) with the first application.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this will work wonders for someone who has skin that is not too sensitive, who just needs a little moisture boost.  </li>
            <li>Brand new bottle.</li>
            <li>One of my new favorites.</li>
            <li>I used to get a new pimple every day.</li>
            <li>I HAVEN&#x27;T HAD ANY NEW ACNE AND THE SCARRING</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product...could be a little less runny though!  </li>
            <li>I gave this moisturizer to my mom, she is older that 50 years old....</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply on your skin with the eyedropper and because the consistency of the serum is slightly thicker it is easy to put it on without making a mess.</li>
            <li>My skin seems to be &amp;#34;brighter&amp;#34; and very soft.</li>
            <li>Also, I have had no adverse reactions and I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have noticed the fine lines around my eyes and mouth have decreased and my skin has an overall better tone, texture firmness and glow to it.</li>
            <li>It is easy to spread, and will last a long time.</li>
            <li>I have used this only a short time but so far I like the way my face feels smooth after using.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Today is Tuesday and after using the product last night for the first time I am looking forward to the changes ahead.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>So soft to the touch!</li>
            <li>In less than 2 weeks time my fine lines and wrinkles are diminishing.</li>
            <li>This was so smooth and after just a few weeks I can see fines lines becoming less.</li>
            <li>It sinks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
            <li>However, if you have very sensitive skin, you may want to steer clear of this product.</li>
            <li>It was very sticky going on, and I found that you had to use more than usual, to cover the entire face and neck.</li>
            <li>I also have smile lines and mildly dry facial skin and slightly large pores.</li>
            <li>I also have smile lines and mildly dry facial skin and slightly large pores.</li>
            <li>My skin has improved immensely and my wrinkles have gotten alot less prominent.  </li>
            <li>They both smooth your skin, and give you a slight natural glow.</li>
            <li>It also leaves your face feeling smooth and tight.</li>
            <li>I use probably three large drops to cover my entire face and neck.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a light feel to it, although if you use a lot, it might feel a little sticky.  </li>
            <li>This is a huge part of my everyday beauty regiment.  </li>
            <li>it really makes my face soft and younger looking..</li>
            <li>Since I am allergic to the world and don&#x27;t like using personal care products that contain chemicals that I can&#x27;t even pronounce, I really like that this serum is 98% natural and 72% organic.</li>
            <li>is so clear...</li>
            <li>It is completely clear.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this product did nothing to irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>and then I use Organic Olive Oil as a natural moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It keep my skin soft and hydrated</li>
            <li>THAT MY SKIN LOOKS SO SOFT .I</li>
            <li>Have only used day &amp; night for 3 days so can&#x27;t give much opinion.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin soft.  </li>
            <li>There is no trouble serum.</li>
            <li>The Hyaluronic Acid Serum is made from natural products and is packed with antioxidants.  </li>
            <li>The serum is oderless and not heavy .</li>
            <li>It really penetrated deep into my skin!</li>
            <li>It smooths your skin and gives skin a soft glow.</li>
            <li>Also, it does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not messy and it goes directly where you place it.</li>
            <li>havent noticed much over all change but its only been a week.</li>
            <li>This product so far is beyond what I hoped for.</li>
            <li>If you want to keep your face looking and feeling young or help reduce aging that has already occurred</li>
            <li>I like this so far.  </li>
            <li>Works well so far.</li>
            <li>Sooo silky soft now</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 50s, and I feel like the serum took years off of my looks.  </li>
            <li>This Hyaluronic Acid Serum is not harsh at all.</li>
            <li>It is gentle, has no odor, doesn&#x27;t irritate or sting my facial skin.</li>
            <li>use the hyaluronic serum in my professional treatments .Its</li>
            <li>old and an ex-sun worshiper, so I needed all the help I could get….This</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t show my age a lot, except on the back of my hands.</li>
            <li>Redness to my old face .  </li>
            <li>Has made my face feel so soft</li>
            <li>After only a couple weeks of using this product my skin is absolutely glowing.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling soft and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this  anyone wanting a product that works well and is not a waste of money.</li>
            <li>So far I like it.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>It is a substance naturally found in the body to cushion joints as well as hydrate the skin.</li>
            <li>The excema like rash in my t-zone is almost completely gone.</li>
            <li>It is non greasy and leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It is unscented and leaves my skin feeling refreshed, soft and smoother.</li>
            <li>IM GETTING READY TO PURCHASE THE VITAMIN C SERUM NEXT AND USE THEM TOGETHER..</li>
            <li>I would reccomend this product to anyone that is looking to look young again without the need of plastic surgery or needles.</li>
            <li>I was happily surprised when my coworkers said yesterday that I look brighter.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>You will be receiving copious orders from my friends, family, and complete strangers.</li>
            <li>So far I like it.</li>
            <li>Being 62 years young my skin is showing signs of maturing.</li>
            <li>So far I see no Difference.</li>
            <li>but I feel like it&#x27;s never too early to start using anti-aging products.</li>
            <li>I simply add it to my moisturizer everyday :)</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t heavy or greasy it can only get better from here.</li>
            <li>My fine lines are noticeably less apparent and the redness in my face is lessening.</li>
            <li>; chin acne was barely noticeable the first month of use and almost non existent the second month.</li>
            <li>The amount is generous, but the consistency of the colorless, see-through serum is thick, so if it is used according to the instructions on the face neck and décolletage, the amount needed is as well more.</li>
            <li>My skin is not only softer and smoother, my hands are too; I even had a compliment on how soft they were!!!</li>
            <li>The price is right, and the bottle will last me several months.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for about a week now, and I am seeing my skin change back to normal in front of my eyes each day!</li>
            <li>had previously been using a different brand of Hyaluronic Acid serum but the Joy and Karma brand does not only cost less</li>
            <li>It sinks right into my skin, without feeling greasy or sticky.</li>
            <li>I was on vacation in vegas and the temp was so hot that my face was so dry it started peeling</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re young start using this product to stay looking young and if you are older start using this product for younger youthful looking skin.  </li>
            <li>bottle is about half full</li>
            <li>After the serum totally dried on my face the skin felt very smooth and stretched out.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this a few months ago.  </li>
            <li>However, old age does creep up on you &amp; the fine lines I do have (very few)</li>
            <li>and I have had many issues with break outs in the past with different moisturizers, but this has not caused a one.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t tell the difference except for the price is higher for same stuff, same size.</li>
            <li>but, my skin felt different the very next morning after the first use.</li>
            <li>This product is highly moisturizing and it helps to keep my skin moisturized and hydrated throughout the day while wearing it under my daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>There has been no irritation on my sensitive dry skin and it has really improved moisturization.</li>
            <li>Upon initial use, I found the product to be of a water type texture and not thick.</li>
            <li>Not sure I noticed a difference after using but went on smooth.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing this product again and suggest anyone looking for something that does what it says with no icky smell or residue give it a try</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and expected.</li>
            <li>My skin has a certain glow and is no longer dry and flaky.</li>
            <li>The few deep creases I have in my face seem to have filled in already.</li>
            <li>The serum does not dry your face out, but leaves it feeling soft and well moisturized.</li>
            <li>Let me tell you, 1st important for me , no Oder, only needs a few drops at a time.  </li>
            <li>so it last pretty long.</li>
            <li>Noticed improvement on my sensitive and mature skin on the second day.  </li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s an anti-aging product that is not broken up into tedious steps.</li>
            <li>I think the (watery) Aloe Vera base is just perfect, personally.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is easy to apply and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Both products are easy to use and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I had lines at the corner of my eyes and now I can barely see them!</li>
            <li>It is premature to report any major difference in my complexion</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve noticed that although I&#x27;ve done exactly that with this serum, I did forget a couple of times and didn&#x27;t bother using anything other than the product.</li>
            <li>My dark spots are lighter and wrinkles less prominent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m using too much, just the right amount or not quite enough.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that in the mornings my skin looked much smoother and my fine lines disappeared so much that I started using it on my chest where I have a few sun spots starting, they are slowly disappearing too.</li>
            <li>I already have pretty clear skin, but sometimes it dries a bit from the harsh Texas weather</li>
            <li>I put this on at night and my skin is so soft and tighter in the morning, you only need a couple drops</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried quite a few different products that really don&#x27;t seem to make much difference...</li>
            <li>I was not expecting to actually notice any difference, but I was very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>The foundation stays on very well, there is no sign of slipping or oiliness, the serum had a smoothing effect and calming effect on my skin.</li>
            <li>I only just started using it ,but so far it seems to be working.</li>
            <li>I let that soak in for about five to ten minutes as well and follow with a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;The biggest change I have noticed to far is on my forehead.</li>
            <li>My reason for this was because I had only tried them alone for a short period and personally could not see much difference although others could.</li>
            <li>I have to say &amp;#34;This really works!!!&amp;#34; I didn&#x27;t notice it so much in my face, as I have few wrinkles there, but on the back of my hands ........</li>
            <li>The Vitamin C serum, however, is very watery and not very spreadable, and I found myself having to use a lot.</li>
            <li>Seems to be improving the action of the products I currently use.</li>
            <li>Since using the products, I have noticed a brighter and smoother skin tone, smaller pores, diminished wrinkles around my eyes, and a pleasantly unexpected result...</li>
            <li>I barely noticed that I had it on under makeup.</li>
            <li>We are only as old as we feel until we look in a mirror</li>
            <li>I will update this review in the future, with further details of long term usage on skin, for both me, 18yrs old, and my mother, 50yrs old, to report on the effects for both young and old skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this product a few weeks, but so far I&#x27;m loving how much tighter my skin feels which has decreased my smiles lines.</li>
            <li>if it made my skin look any better -- it didn&#x27;t make it worse.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, dry mature skin.  </li>
            <li>I am going to give it a few more weeks to see if skin hydration becomes less of a problem.</li>
            <li>On my first application I notice that the JK Hyaluronic acid serum hydrates my skin and relieves the dry pulling tension associated with dry skin.</li>
            <li>Seems to do the job of other hydralonic serums that cost 5x&#x27;s as much.</li>
            <li>BUT it spreads very well and absorbs with no feeling or residue of it on the skin like some other products out there</li>
            <li>they are very responsive and extremely helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I might have been a little heavy handed when using the dropper ( which I love for an applicator )</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to apply this serum to my eyes as this area is always so delicate, but there have been only positive effects--no redness, burning or peeling, so it&#x27;s very gentle, which is a definite plus.  </li>
            <li>so far no major result</li>
            <li>My skin was soft, yet tight, and fine lines looked less obvious almost immediately!  </li>
            <li>the ingredients are all expensive and natural u gotta love ur skin and take care of urself</li>
            <li>that were far more expensive and did not work as well as this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended Item is just what i expected.</li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive skin and have been looking for a long time for something that my skin can tolerate and that actually improves my skintone.</li>
            <li>I like this one because it is a bit more thick than the other serums that I have tried.</li>
            <li>My skin is in pretty bad shape by most standards, I have a nervous condtion</li>
            <li>and I use it about half as much as this..</li>
            <li>and these products have keep my face from getting dry and that old leather look that some people get in the summertime from tanned skin.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone who has sensitive and dry combination skin.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to make an informed decision about any long-term benefits; but so far I can say that I like the feel of the product</li>
            <li>Serum is very thick and slightly sticky, but nice.</li>
            <li>I have no little dry patches anymore</li>
            <li>The Acid serum is a little thicker than I had anticipated but that was fine with me, took a few seconds longer to absorb</li>
            <li>I was a bit skeptical when I first purchased this product, but I am now a believer, many other serums I had tried always left my skin sticky and looking dry or crepey, but</li>
            <li>I would have expected some minimal positive outcome in 8 weeks, but there&#x27;s been no visible improvement.  </li>
            <li>very dry skin became soft and moist like a baby.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s too soon to say good or bad</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is a really great product.</li>

            <li> and I have noticed visible improvement on expression lines, for a week I am using in combination with Joy &amp; Karma&#x27;s Vit C Serum</li>
            <li> This serum works great.</li>
            <li> I also use the Joy and Karma Vitamin C serum and swap between the two.</li>

            <li> good</li>
            <li> I liked the Joy &amp; Karma Vitamin C serum, so when I was given the opportunity to purchase the Joy &amp; Karma Hyaluronic Acid Serum at a promotional price, I was happy to be able to try the two products together and share my experiences.  </li>
            <li> It feels good on the skin and pairs well with my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It feels so good and can tell it makes my face look healthier.</li>

            <li> Theses products aré verry good.</li>
            <li> so I could give this a fair review.  </li>
            <li> Despite all the good reviews, this product just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> and I am good to go.</li>
            <li> No skin problems too good</li>
            <li> Just as good as the Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> Feels so good on my face</li>
            <li> So I would not be a good person to review for improvement of wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I am comparing it to the one that I absolutely loved so I may be biased.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Packaging: The packaging was good.</li>
            <li> Would be good for someone with dryer skin.</li>
            <li> Smooths out the skin on my face and works really good with my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I tried this for a couple of weeks and loved the way it went on my skin.</li>
            <li> Good product</li>
            <li> This is a good product.</li>
            <li> This product arrived in good time.</li>

            <li> I have used two bottle of this serum now and although I initially liked it and therefore purchased more, I&#x27;ve come to have some reservations.  </li>
            <li> i still feel like I need more time with it, but I honestly started having people tell me I look like I lost weight in my face within a week of using it.  </li>
            <li> Great product, saw results after one night,my face felt and looked smooth, minimized the appearance of fine lines and pores.</li>

            <li> My fine lines are softened to the point of almost nonexistent and my skin radiates!</li>
            <li> After the moisturizer sunk in my skin, it felt very smooth, elasticized and hydrated.</li>
            <li> Many creams and serums burn but this is very gentle and feels great on.</li>
            <li> so you might want to say pea size or something but very smooth</li>
            <li> I am loving this serum easy to use</li>
            <li> Lovely hyaluronic serum, somewhat between a liquid and a gel, absorbs quickly, does the job, good percentage, no scent.</li>
            <li> The scent is very light and refreshing and not overpowering like some beauty products.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, and now my skin looks very smooth and nice.</li>
            <li> I am 62 years old and take very good care of my skin.</li>

            <li> Along with that I try and exercise and also eat a fairly healthy diet as well.  </li>
            <li> With the added ingredients of the C and E and MSM the moisturizing is even better.  </li>

            <li> and I love the fragrance</li>
            <li> I love this serum.  </li>
            <li> Keeps skin smooth and smells nice.</li>
            <li> but I do feel that my face looks fresher and more flowing than before.</li>

            <li> Friend excited to use it.</li>
            <li> face is full and smooth when I wake up and not sunken in anymore.</li>
            <li> AND THERE&#x27;S A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN MY SKIN TONE.</li>
            <li> my skin looks plumper and fresh!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if its just my unique experience</li>
            <li> Another great aspect is that this serum is made of a large percentage of natural and organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> Most hyaluronic products are mixed in some kind of creme.</li>
            <li> very moisturizing, reasonable price, good texture</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly &amp; absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> So great for dry saggy skin.</li>
            <li> I like that it goes on light and absorbs fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> this stuff is great, i use it every day, its really helped my skin clear up</li>
            <li> it just makes my face look younger and feel good it gives it a smooth feeling over your face  leaving it hydrated</li>
            <li> I love that they are natural and mostly organic.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Has a pleasant smell and extends on your face very smoothly in a second.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so excited to be able to go show my new face off!!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel nice and soft!</li>
            <li> After a hot shower and good facial cleansing, I put this on at night love the way my skin feels afterwards.</li>
            <li> For someone that has oily / sensitive skin, there have been zero problems (and I probably used way more than I should!)</li>
            <li> now I don&#x27;t notice the fine wrinkles when I smile.</li>
            <li> I loved that it didn&#x27;t leave a film or residue like most other serums I have tried, that speaks volumes about this product</li>
            <li> The product is light, gives great coverage, and sinks into the skin quickly without leaving a sticky or tacky residue.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this serum.</li>
            <li> SPECIAL.</li>
            <li> Trust me I will buy again even without special.</li>
            <li> You can feel your skin tighten right after putting it on!</li>
            <li> I love hyaluronic acid serums because they work so well, are extremely gentle, help lighten dark spots, most effective at treating eczema on my baby&#x27;s skin, is very clean with no residue, doesn&#x27;t clog pores and doesn&#x27;t have any smell.  </li>
            <li> I have seen a difference in the look of my fine lines and wrinkles, (Deep cracks and Crevices) since using the Best Hyaluranic Acid Serum Facial Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> and I was impressed and its hard to impress me.</li>
            <li> I have never in my life been able to have a clear, hydrated, and healthy looking face until now, and when i started this 2 weeks ago my face was completely dry and flaky and i had several hormone related acne spots, after ordering DHEA 50mg along with the Best Hyaluronic Acid Serum + the Vitamin C serum by Joy and Karma.</li>
            <li> ...anyways, this stuff is awesome and the price is hard to beat.</li>
            <li> First, it goes on very smoothly and easily and absorbs almost as fast as you put it on.  </li>
            <li> I used Joy and Karma&#x27;s vitamin C and really did not notice a big change in my skin, but once I added the hyaluronic acid serum I seen a huge difference in just three days...</li>
            <li> As a woman on the fast train to the age of 43, I am always looking for great products for my face to keep it looking fresh and young.</li>
            <li> Light weight and easily absorbed.</li>
            <li> I love the product, it absorbs fast and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky.</li>
            <li> a lot more elastic, supple like a plumbed bean and in addition, it became very hydrated.</li>
            <li> that I would or could  pay full price.......</li>
            <li> shared this serum with my Mom, just to have a true way to see the change without combining serums on me.</li>
            <li> First of all ordering through Amazon was a good experience, the serum arrived pretty fast.</li>
            <li> One recommendation would be if J&amp;K gave more of a guideline about how much to use.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t use that many face products just a face wash and some face lotion</li>
            <li> My wrinkles have not disappeared but they are much finer and my skin looks significantly better.</li>
            <li> I love how this product feels going on and my face feels much softer and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> Highly recommended! :)</li>
            <li> no difference after full 45 days with lines or wrinkles</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a good hyaluronic acid serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I Received this product free along with the vitamin C and and I really did see a difference with the fine lines and the races around my mouth and under my neck, I recommend getting both products ..</li>
            <li> These are a great alternative to those other chemical laden products.</li>
            <li> My face finally looks BEAUTIFUL, and what&#x27;s funny is the dryness went away after my first use.</li>
            <li> In the first week of using, the fine lines on my face are almost gone.</li>
            <li> I also like the way it smells so fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> It absorbs into your skin quickly so you can put your moisturizer on.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly asks i can wear it under moisturizer and make up.</li>
            <li> I used it all and then tried one of the big name brands that costs 3 times as much and promises great results.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, and my skin feels hydrated.</li>
            <li> the delivery was quick</li>
            <li> but it absorbs quite quickly</li>
            <li> I was not expecting to notice any difference so quickly.</li>
            <li> Quick drying</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this serum, it goes on smooth and it makes my makeup look professional</li>
            <li> MY ACNE SCARS HAVE LIGHTENED UP TREMENDOUSLY.</li>
            <li> This gel dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> I appreciate the quick delivery and do like the consistency of the product.  </li>
            <li> You can look several years younger with faithful application of this awesome product.</li>
            <li> I just love this serum, I have been looking for such a produst for a long time and believe that good things come to those who wait!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a moisturizer that helps smooth and tighten!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!&lt;br /&gt;Makes my skin so soft!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waiting a few weeks to write this review because I wanted to give this product a good test drive, and I feel like i&#x27;ve had enough time using it to give my honest opinion, and let me say I am in love.</li>
            <li> One of my new favorite serums</li>
            <li> My skin is super soft and the fine lines are fading!</li>
            <li> This feels really good on my skin and keeps it from being as dry.</li>
            <li> so i was skeptic about the easy speadablity and the absorbing of it</li>
            <li> OK, I waited a while to write this review, because I wanted to really try this product first.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have seen zero issues with this product and love the way it makes my skin feel and look.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have issues with many beauty products, not this one.</li>

            <li> First thing I loved about this was that its 98% natural and 72% organic next thing was the fact it wasn&#x27;t runny most serums</li>
            <li> My skin looks very smooth and clear.</li>
            <li> Very light serum with a soft scent.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell if it makes a difference in the fine lines yet.  </li>
            <li> product has been very helpful at plumping up my skin and reducing the fine lines on my face.</li>
            <li> not JK, it went on smooth and absorbed quickly leaving my skin ready for moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I am so excited about this stuff and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to soften there laugh lines and crows feet and have that all around healthy look.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t put much on my face at all except what is mostly organic and pure.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find products that don&#x27;t irritate my skin, but this serum works really well, and the results are great!</li>
            <li> After using the serum for 2 weeks, my skin is so much softer and smooth.</li>
            <li> My face hasn&#x27;t felt smoother and been more clear.</li>
            <li> Skin feels fresh.</li>
            <li> and so far I love it.</li>
            <li> day, feeling the skin, there is fun to see in the mirror</li>
            <li> Since I just received it, can&#x27;t give a full review, these are my first impressions.</li>
            <li> I love how soft my skin feels after just one use.</li>
            <li> I like also the fact that it&#x27;s mostly organic&amp; natural ..</li>
            <li> A light scent, non oily with oodles of added Vitamins to keep my skin smooth, supple and young.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft, and that makes my make up even better.</li>
            <li> I love it, I&#x27;ve been using it for two days only and it feels smooth and fresh</li>
            <li> It is well worth the price</li>
            <li> and I love the effects so far....</li>
            <li> I really love this Serum, I can really see the difference in my skin after one use, Thanks</li>
            <li> My face looked brighter and more alive</li>
            <li> While a bit of a sceptic of facial products, believing more in the benefits of a healthy diet, ample hydration, exercise, gentle cleansing and a balance between sun and sun protection to keep skin youthful, after reading about the benefits of hyaluronic acid</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is also well absorbed .</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I really love this product and I&#x27;m all about natural.</li>
            <li> and so far I love it.</li>
            <li> Love it do far.</li>
            <li> that along makes it worth using &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m in love wuthering the way it feels and can already notice a difference.</li>
            <li> and this is the first time in over 15 years that she felt confident enough to not wear a face full of foundation/powder and concealer!</li>
            <li> I was right she likes it and said she feel her face more soft.</li>
            <li> It appears that this serum drys out my skin a bit more than other products however, my skin tone and appearance does appear more even.</li>
            <li> This product has given my skin a clear, clean, smooth look.</li>
            <li> It has made my skin feel softer and has noticeably reduced a wrinkle on the right side of my face..</li>
            <li> I got this through a promo and started using it right away.  </li>
            <li> Soaks right in, not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is just right</li>
            <li> Received right away.</li>
            <li> I noticed right away a smoothness to my skin and a tighting in the neck area.</li>
            <li> I noticed the difference right away. .</li>
            <li> as someone with thin, sensitive skin I can honestly say that I have never been more pleased with a skin care product!  </li>
            <li> I applied a daily moisturizer, exactly as mentioned in the instructions as the serum is not meant to be used on his own, but in a combination with a day or night cream.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed more elasticity to my skin as well as major wrinkle reduction and pore&#x27;s are minimized as an added bonus its clearing up some hormonal acne.</li>
            <li> This is a great basic facial serum - works well at softening skin - the price was very reasonable!</li>
            <li> Using this has made a huge improvement on my skin, i feel like it feels super soft.</li>
            <li> So far my face continues to be very smooth and it moisturizes very well.  </li>
            <li> I am using this  as my facial moistuizer,goes on silky and smooth has reduces some fine lines</li>
            <li> I have thinning skin under the eye &amp; can really notice that this product lifts &amp; really helps with fine line and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> seems to only work on very fine lines, skin feels oily instead of moisterized</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have experienced no itching, burning, redness or other allergic reactions to this product.</li>
            <li> ITS A VERY NICE PRODUCT, I WILL BE ORDERING IT AGAIN WHEN I RUN OUT, WHICH VERY LITTLE GOES ALONG</li>
            <li> Love this Serum, I really helps my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> I have bee using Best Hyaluronic Acid Serum for a few days now, and I must say that it feels different from anything I have ever used before.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few days after my toner during my skin care routine and my face and neck already feel more hydrated and healthy.</li>
            <li> Not enough moisture for dry skin but great for oily skin, absorbs quickly, weightless.</li>
            <li> These were delivered super fast.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;So far I love your product, makes my skin very soft.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s 98% natural, which can only be a good thing.</li>
            <li> I am a type 1 diabetic who has had some sort of acne all of my life i have NEVER been able to find something powerful enough to keep my face hydrated UNTIL NOW!!</li>
            <li> These Joy &amp; Karma products will replace two more expensive - chemical products for me.</li>

            <li> Shipping was fast too!</li>
            <li> eyedropper is not my favorite type of dispenser because I need two hands to use it and there is a chance at spilling the bottle or contamination when it&#x27;s open</li>
            <li> Serum is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> The product shipped fast!  </li>
            <li> Looking forward to future use for even better results..</li>
            <li> This is the first Hyaluronic Acid Serum I have ever used</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this for everyone !</li>
            <li> A great product have not used long enough to see results yet.</li>
            <li> Although I have only been using this for a week, I must say that I love it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a powerhouse that really performs !</li>
            <li> First the Shipping &amp;#62;&amp;#62</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase of this and the Vitamin C Serum</li>
            <li> was my face first, then I use the Hyaluronic Acid Serum.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different things to help.</li>
            <li> Soft, smooth glowing, even skin is what I have now.</li>
            <li> I first purchased it</li>
            <li> I tried this hyaluronic acid for the first time and had no irritation whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> It even has my first name on it</li>
            <li> I plan to order more in the future</li>
            <li> Perlabella HA reversed signs of aging and even felt different on my skin that most HA products.  </li>
            <li> It states on the instructions that if you use a toner, to use toner first, then serum and you can apply your moisturizer and makeup over the serum.  </li>
            <li> My skin just drinks it up, and it feels smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to someone who need more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> but it goes fast!</li>
            <li> , it makes my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m 65 years old, finding a product like this is really important.</li>
            <li> thanks!  </li>
            <li> Love all the ingredients of this product and can only recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love the facial serum.</li>
            <li> People have been complimenting me so much!</li>
            <li> I have noticed since I started using it that my skin tone looks more even and definitely clearer.  </li>
            <li> At first I am kinda scared to use this because of the name itself Acid...</li>
            <li> I like this serum so much better than their regular vitamin C serum because of the thickness of the formula.</li>
            <li> Not only has the acne diminished but my skin looks more alive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mix two drops of each together morning and night as a serum under my moisturizer and after only two weeks my skin is looking better.</li>
            <li> I love this product and week two seen a big difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> They work very well together!</li>
            <li> There are many companies who simply ignore customers who ask a lot of questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> Love these facial moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really seen a difference in my skin!</li>
            <li> Although I did&#x27;t / haven&#x27;t begun to use it consistently</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not taking away any stars because of my negative reaction because I truly don&#x27;t believe the Joy and Karma gel had anything to do with it.  </li>
            <li> Upon first using this, I already noticed a difference in my skin&#x27;s texture.</li>
            <li> I love this serum together with the Vitamin C serum from same company.</li>
            <li> My skin felt so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I have used this several days and love it.</li>
            <li> I used it twice a day for a month and my face felt smoother and looked better overall.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this product made my face and neck feel!</li>
            <li> my skin is not only looking better its softer feeling.  </li>
            <li> I REALLY SEE A DIFFRENCE!   </li>
            <li> My face feels younger and looks better.</li>
            <li> I used this acid first after cleansing then moisturize.</li>
            <li> or maybe its a combination of both ;)</li>
            <li> Its a good serum, and I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I have fair complexion and some trouble with rosacia on my cheeks, nose, and forehead.</li>
            <li> After that I use pure organic rose petal water and just spray all over my hair and my face and let dry.  </li>
            <li> I am a new user of this stuff-I like that it is mostly organic and natural.  </li>
            <li> Thought this was more pure than it actually is.</li>
            <li> First it is not as watery as the other brand, and it really makes my skin look radiant and supple, love it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&amp;#34;fantastic product - msm - and other ingredients are excellent for the skin - for encouraging collagen and moisturizing with creating black heads etc.</li>
            <li> Fine lines are becoming less noticeable and my skin looks refreshed.</li>
            <li> My skin tone has evened and it&#x27;s noticeably more firm, and I&#x27;ve noticed a huge improvement in the moisture level.  </li>
            <li> I believe in using serums and love the way JK feels, not sticky, dries quickly and sinks in fast.</li>
            <li> I think the bottles would be much safer in their own boxes though, because they easily could have been damaged during the handling process if it was handled by a clumsy postman.</li>
            <li> my skin is more clear and soft</li>
            <li> takes just a drop, applies very easy, my face does not feel dry after applying, always use a night creme after applying, but really like it</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and my skin feels great all day long.</li>
            <li> After 3 days of use with this i noticed a positive difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this three stars because I didn&#x27;t see any positive results in the two months I used it.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> and I hope in a long run it will make my skin better...</li>
            <li> The upper lid was becoming droopy, causing me to have to change how I put my eye makeup on, but I think there&#x27;s been some tightening</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t tend to pay that much attention to my looks or keep a consistent regimen.&lt;br</li>
            <li> face is smoother, my skin is not dry and the fine lines are not so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely pleased that you don&#x27;t need to use much, and my first bottle lasted a really long time.</li>
            <li> are just as good, if not better.  </li>
            <li> It works beautifully when I mixed a little with the soy moisturizer I have.</li>
            <li> So after a few weeks I decided to buy myself my own and it has left my skin so nice and soft.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a film like some other serums and my moisturizer glides over it very easily.</li>
            <li> After use, found my skin to be super soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a mild case of acne (even at 57 years old)</li>
            <li> My facial and neck area looks much more healthy meaning that my skin is not dull, dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> my dark spots are less visible as well, I started using both serums separately, and within a week I started combining them, I am getting better results combining them both, this particular serum smells really nice and leaves your skin so soft, I love the fact that these products are organic, they certainly feel natural, I will most likely purchase again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using ht for just over 2 weeks and can certainly see a difference in my skin</li>
            <li> I will certainly continue to use and will recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> It certainly came out of the bottle a bit thicker.</li>
            <li> I have been using this along with the Vit C Serum for a few weeks and my skin is looking better than it has in years!</li>
            <li> my face is more clear and fine lines and wrinkles less noticeable</li>
            <li> Application is easy, however, it does take me a while to work it in my skin (which is the only issue, I really have with it).</li>
            <li> Not only does it help skin retain moisture, but it helps to plump out the skin, minimizing the look of fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> My pores are usually large and my foundation does not go on smooth, after only two of using this</li>
            <li> I first used the serum without moisturizer to see if my face would dry out and while it felt fine, it felt even softer after using moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I noticed a huge improvement in my skin in only two weeks....</li>
            <li> My face and neck are looking so much hetter..</li>
            <li> in just a week my skin feels so much smoother and just nicer.</li>

            <li> It has a very lite scent that fades so you aren&#x27;t smelling the product all day.  </li>
            <li> It is smooth and it actually got rid of some of the redness on my cheeks and nose that would not otherwise go away.</li>
            <li> This serum is really moisturizing and hydrating my skin without making it feeling greasy and sticky.</li>
            <li> and I needed something to help moisturize and i used this product and it helped it out so much.</li>

            <li> My wrinkly skin is much smoother now and looks well hydrated.</li>
            <li> After using it for two weeks, I can really tell a difference.</li>
            <li> My skin is much softer and smoother than it was.</li>
            <li> I have received comments/questions on what have I done because my complexion is really youthful looking.  </li>
            <li> Very hydrating and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> The real deal.</li>
            <li> I used the whole bottle and didn&#x27;t see any results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not seen much improvement in my skin at all.</li>
            <li> It felt really hydrated.</li>
            <li> -I can feel it absorbing into my skin.</li>
            <li> I am a 63 years woman and although the skin of my face has not deteriorated much I do have the spots and wrinkles that come with aging.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> The backs of my hands look so much smoother and plumper (I&#x27;m 51, and washing dishes by hand had really beaten up my skin).</li>
            <li> I applied to my face and gently patted it in.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t say I have really noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> At 74 I presently am fortunate enough not to have wrinkles</li>

            <li> nothing really to report.</li>
            <li> Thanks for letting me try this.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who wants to improve their skin texture at any stage of life.</li>
            <li> It will probably run out 3x as fast as the Hya. Serum.</li>
            <li> This was very comforting.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling fresh and soft.</li>
            <li> and i have noticed that it has really moisturized my face and has made it seem smoother.&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>

            <li> Facing 60 this year and really seeing a change in my skin</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Fabulous facial serum!</li>
            <li> very good!!&lt;br /&gt;Skin became moist</li>
            <li> This is so hydrating and really brightens my face.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks I really could not see much difference.</li>
            <li> I continued to use 2 x day but at this point I really cannot see much difference.</li>
            <li> Again at this point I can not see much difference.</li>
            <li> My face feels so much healthier and looks a lot nicer since I started using it.</li>
            <li> This product was sent to me at a low price in exchange of a review, and I can honestly say I will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Not only does my skin look and feel better, but I was also having problems with some adult acne and age spots.</li>
            <li> The only difference I have noted so far is that the Vitamin C side has a more powdery skin feel.</li>
            <li> Good product, slow delivery when faster shipment/receipt was advertised, Thanks,</li>
            <li> All i had to do was find something that was mostly natural and/or organic, I can&#x27;t believe i NEVER thought of that!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also aging early because of (stress) a lot of hydrocortisone use through the years for my eczema and this HELPS!!!</li>
            <li> I have purchased two different kinds Hyaluronic Acid Serum and JK is much well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Not so much a lightening of dark spots, but an overall more smooth appearance.  </li>
            <li> I do see slight improvements with very fine lines I have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a sensitivity to other skin care products and made sure that I used the Vitamin C for 5 days with out reaction before I added the hyaluronic acid serum</li>
            <li> and I have tried many other brands on the market today.  </li>
            <li> i normally use image hyaluronic serum and that is a higher % but is more expensive- overall good stuff i would order again</li>
            <li> I have been using your serums religiously for the past couple weeks, I love the way it absorbs quickly, my skin looks and feels softer and most importantly younger.</li>
            <li> I am also on a mostly natural kick, so I was very very please with the ingredient list.</li>
            <li> I only paid $1.50 for my bottle, there was a fb special promotion (i think it was on fb).</li>
            <li> It seems to help hold the moisture in pretty well though, given its natural organic ingredients vs chemical ones.</li>
            <li> Did notice a much more noticeable lightening of dark spots on my hands, though.</li>
            <li> The formula did work well in clearing some old scarring when I first used it.</li>
            <li> There is a new hero in town!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product if you would like to have a new GLOW about you face!</li>
            <li> They answered my questions quickly and were helpful regarding uses for their facial serum</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these products for several weeks, and my skin is soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> This definitely helped my skin look young and feel smooth.</li>
            <li> my particular skin didn&#x27;t agree with this product.</li>
            <li> I also love how you only need maybe 2 drops for the entire face and neck.</li>
            <li> I have been using for a few days now and my skin all ready looks better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not conclusive since I&#x27;ve changed my hair color, length and style (which impacts the look of your skin drastically, as to get older</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mild enough for me to use day.</li>
            <li> I use mine with the Vitamin C serum to protect my skin from the elements and to minimize signs of aging (after all, just because I am getting older</li>
            <li> It has none of those nasty chemical smells that many serums have; it is very pleasant!</li>
            <li> My face looks shiny and vibrant.</li>
            <li> Love this serum that provides so much moisture to the trouble spots around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment-makes my skin feel soft and hydrated!</li>
            <li> This particular one is a must for my staying young arsenal!!</li>
            <li> High quality too.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a high quality product, and I recommend it.</li>

            <li> Highly Recommende</li>
            <li> highly recommend both these products.</li>
            <li> I am using this every day along with the viatmin C.I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend</li>
            <li> Works as well as high priced serums from high end department stores.</li>
            <li> Looks high quality.</li>
            <li> absorbs quikley highly recomend</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I love that their products use mostly natural ingredients, I have been looking at hydraulic and C serums but have not bought due to chemicals.</li>
            <li> A little watery compared to most hylauronic acid products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Her skin noticeably changed not long after using it, gaining back some of its natural elasticity and healthy glow.</li>
            <li> much smoother, better skin tone and those little crows feet I have are almost invisible!</li>
            <li> I really like that it is natural, organic and NOT tested on animals.  </li>
            <li> Very well tolerated on my extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a short time, but my skin is soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles but the few I have</li>
            <li> Tightens, seems to be building strength in the skin which many products promise and few deliver on..</li>
            <li> During this time, I had no negative skin reaction to the gel at all.  </li>
            <li> Left my skin feeling tightened and fresh.</li>
            <li> Never used before and after a few weeks,  my skin looks clearer and healthier with a more even tone.</li>
            <li> With the really harsh winter weather in New York City, I may need a more emollient serum.</li>
            <li> My skin simply became super sensitive overnight.  </li>
            <li> I apply right after washing and allow several minutes for absorption.  </li>
            <li> manufacturers are sincerely interested in your enjoyment of their product and are invested in your success with it, so nothing I&#x27;ve said is due to any lack of their care and communication.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly, so the sticky feeling is not for long.  </li>
            <li> You will a slight tingle when first using the product but other than that this serum is amazing.</li>
            <li> So far I am very pleased with the results although I&#x27;ve only been using the products for a few days.</li>
            <li> It took a few days before I saw any noticeable difference, but my face felt different (better) with the first application.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this will work wonders for someone who has skin that is not too sensitive, who just needs a little moisture boost.  </li>
            <li> Brand new bottle.</li>
            <li> One of my new favorites.</li>
            <li> I used to get a new pimple every day.</li>
            <li> I HAVEN&#x27;T HAD ANY NEW ACNE AND THE SCARRING</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product...could be a little less runny though!  </li>
            <li> I gave this moisturizer to my mom, she is older that 50 years old....</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply on your skin with the eyedropper and because the consistency of the serum is slightly thicker it is easy to put it on without making a mess.</li>
            <li> My skin seems to be &amp;#34;brighter&amp;#34; and very soft.</li>
            <li> Also, I have had no adverse reactions and I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have noticed the fine lines around my eyes and mouth have decreased and my skin has an overall better tone, texture firmness and glow to it.</li>
            <li> It is easy to spread, and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have used this only a short time but so far I like the way my face feels smooth after using.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Today is Tuesday and after using the product last night for the first time I am looking forward to the changes ahead.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> So soft to the touch!</li>
            <li> In less than 2 weeks time my fine lines and wrinkles are diminishing.</li>
            <li> This was so smooth and after just a few weeks I can see fines lines becoming less.</li>
            <li> It sinks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
            <li> However, if you have very sensitive skin, you may want to steer clear of this product.</li>
            <li> It was very sticky going on, and I found that you had to use more than usual, to cover the entire face and neck.</li>
            <li> I also have smile lines and mildly dry facial skin and slightly large pores.</li>
            <li> I also have smile lines and mildly dry facial skin and slightly large pores.</li>
            <li> My skin has improved immensely and my wrinkles have gotten alot less prominent.  </li>
            <li> They both smooth your skin, and give you a slight natural glow.</li>
            <li> It also leaves your face feeling smooth and tight.</li>
            <li> I use probably three large drops to cover my entire face and neck.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a light feel to it, although if you use a lot, it might feel a little sticky.  </li>
            <li> This is a huge part of my everyday beauty regiment.  </li>
            <li> it really makes my face soft and younger looking..</li>
            <li> Since I am allergic to the world and don&#x27;t like using personal care products that contain chemicals that I can&#x27;t even pronounce, I really like that this serum is 98% natural and 72% organic.</li>
            <li> is so clear...</li>
            <li> It is completely clear.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this product did nothing to irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> and then I use Organic Olive Oil as a natural moisturizer.  </li>

            <li> There is no trouble serum.</li>

            <li> It really penetrated deep into my skin!</li>
            <li> It smooths your skin and gives skin a soft glow.</li>
            <li> Also, it does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not messy and it goes directly where you place it.</li>
            <li> havent noticed much over all change but its only been a week.</li>
            <li> This product so far is beyond what I hoped for.</li>
            <li> If you want to keep your face looking and feeling young or help reduce aging that has already occurred</li>
            <li> I like this so far.  </li>
            <li> Works well so far.</li>
            <li> Sooo silky soft now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 50s, and I feel like the serum took years off of my looks.  </li>

            <li> So far I like it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> It is a substance naturally found in the body to cushion joints as well as hydrate the skin.</li>
            <li> The excema like rash in my t-zone is almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> It is non greasy and leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It is unscented and leaves my skin feeling refreshed, soft and smoother.</li>
            <li> IM GETTING READY TO PURCHASE THE VITAMIN C SERUM NEXT AND USE THEM TOGETHER..</li>
            <li> I would reccomend this product to anyone that is looking to look young again without the need of plastic surgery or needles.</li>
            <li> I was happily surprised when my coworkers said yesterday that I look brighter.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> You will be receiving copious orders from my friends, family, and complete strangers.</li>
            <li> So far I like it.</li>
            <li> Being 62 years young my skin is showing signs of maturing.</li>
            <li> So far I see no Difference.</li>
            <li> but I feel like it&#x27;s never too early to start using anti-aging products.</li>
            <li> I simply add it to my moisturizer everyday :)</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t heavy or greasy it can only get better from here.</li>
            <li> My fine lines are noticeably less apparent and the redness in my face is lessening.</li>
            <li> ; chin acne was barely noticeable the first month of use and almost non existent the second month.</li>
            <li> The amount is generous, but the consistency of the colorless, see-through serum is thick, so if it is used according to the instructions on the face neck and décolletage, the amount needed is as well more.</li>
            <li> My skin is not only softer and smoother, my hands are too; I even had a compliment on how soft they were!!!</li>
            <li> The price is right, and the bottle will last me several months.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a week now, and I am seeing my skin change back to normal in front of my eyes each day!</li>
            <li> had previously been using a different brand of Hyaluronic Acid serum but the Joy and Karma brand does not only cost less</li>
            <li> It sinks right into my skin, without feeling greasy or sticky.</li>
            <li> I was on vacation in vegas and the temp was so hot that my face was so dry it started peeling</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re young start using this product to stay looking young and if you are older start using this product for younger youthful looking skin.  </li>
            <li> bottle is about half full</li>
            <li> After the serum totally dried on my face the skin felt very smooth and stretched out.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> However, old age does creep up on you &amp; the fine lines I do have (very few)</li>
            <li> and I have had many issues with break outs in the past with different moisturizers, but this has not caused a one.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t tell the difference except for the price is higher for same stuff, same size.</li>
            <li> but, my skin felt different the very next morning after the first use.</li>
            <li> This product is highly moisturizing and it helps to keep my skin moisturized and hydrated throughout the day while wearing it under my daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> There has been no irritation on my sensitive dry skin and it has really improved moisturization.</li>
            <li> Upon initial use, I found the product to be of a water type texture and not thick.</li>
            <li> Not sure I noticed a difference after using but went on smooth.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing this product again and suggest anyone looking for something that does what it says with no icky smell or residue give it a try</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and expected.</li>
            <li> My skin has a certain glow and is no longer dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> The few deep creases I have in my face seem to have filled in already.</li>
            <li> The serum does not dry your face out, but leaves it feeling soft and well moisturized.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, 1st important for me , no Oder, only needs a few drops at a time.  </li>
            <li> so it last pretty long.</li>
            <li> Noticed improvement on my sensitive and mature skin on the second day.  </li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s an anti-aging product that is not broken up into tedious steps.</li>
            <li> I think the (watery) Aloe Vera base is just perfect, personally.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is easy to apply and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Both products are easy to use and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I had lines at the corner of my eyes and now I can barely see them!</li>
            <li> It is premature to report any major difference in my complexion</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve noticed that although I&#x27;ve done exactly that with this serum, I did forget a couple of times and didn&#x27;t bother using anything other than the product.</li>
            <li> My dark spots are lighter and wrinkles less prominent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m using too much, just the right amount or not quite enough.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that in the mornings my skin looked much smoother and my fine lines disappeared so much that I started using it on my chest where I have a few sun spots starting, they are slowly disappearing too.</li>
            <li> I already have pretty clear skin, but sometimes it dries a bit from the harsh Texas weather</li>
            <li> I put this on at night and my skin is so soft and tighter in the morning, you only need a couple drops</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few different products that really don&#x27;t seem to make much difference...</li>
            <li> I was not expecting to actually notice any difference, but I was very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> The foundation stays on very well, there is no sign of slipping or oiliness, the serum had a smoothing effect and calming effect on my skin.</li>
            <li> I only just started using it ,but so far it seems to be working.</li>
            <li> I let that soak in for about five to ten minutes as well and follow with a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;The biggest change I have noticed to far is on my forehead.</li>
            <li> My reason for this was because I had only tried them alone for a short period and personally could not see much difference although others could.</li>
            <li> I have to say &amp;#34;This really works!!!&amp;#34; I didn&#x27;t notice it so much in my face, as I have few wrinkles there, but on the back of my hands ........</li>
            <li> The Vitamin C serum, however, is very watery and not very spreadable, and I found myself having to use a lot.</li>
            <li> Seems to be improving the action of the products I currently use.</li>
            <li> Since using the products, I have noticed a brighter and smoother skin tone, smaller pores, diminished wrinkles around my eyes, and a pleasantly unexpected result...</li>
            <li> I barely noticed that I had it on under makeup.</li>
            <li> We are only as old as we feel until we look in a mirror</li>
            <li> I will update this review in the future, with further details of long term usage on skin, for both me, 18yrs old, and my mother, 50yrs old, to report on the effects for both young and old skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product a few weeks, but so far I&#x27;m loving how much tighter my skin feels which has decreased my smiles lines.</li>
            <li> if it made my skin look any better -- it didn&#x27;t make it worse.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, dry mature skin.  </li>
            <li> I am going to give it a few more weeks to see if skin hydration becomes less of a problem.</li>
            <li> On my first application I notice that the JK Hyaluronic acid serum hydrates my skin and relieves the dry pulling tension associated with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Seems to do the job of other hydralonic serums that cost 5x&#x27;s as much.</li>
            <li> BUT it spreads very well and absorbs with no feeling or residue of it on the skin like some other products out there</li>
            <li> they are very responsive and extremely helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I might have been a little heavy handed when using the dropper ( which I love for an applicator )</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to apply this serum to my eyes as this area is always so delicate, but there have been only positive effects--no redness, burning or peeling, so it&#x27;s very gentle, which is a definite plus.  </li>
            <li> so far no major result</li>
            <li> My skin was soft, yet tight, and fine lines looked less obvious almost immediately!  </li>
            <li> the ingredients are all expensive and natural u gotta love ur skin and take care of urself</li>
            <li> that were far more expensive and did not work as well as this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended Item is just what i expected.</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin and have been looking for a long time for something that my skin can tolerate and that actually improves my skintone.</li>
            <li> I like this one because it is a bit more thick than the other serums that I have tried.</li>
            <li> My skin is in pretty bad shape by most standards, I have a nervous condtion</li>
            <li> and I use it about half as much as this..</li>
            <li> and these products have keep my face from getting dry and that old leather look that some people get in the summertime from tanned skin.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who has sensitive and dry combination skin.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to make an informed decision about any long-term benefits; but so far I can say that I like the feel of the product</li>
            <li> Serum is very thick and slightly sticky, but nice.</li>
            <li> I have no little dry patches anymore</li>
            <li> The Acid serum is a little thicker than I had anticipated but that was fine with me, took a few seconds longer to absorb</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical when I first purchased this product, but I am now a believer, many other serums I had tried always left my skin sticky and looking dry or crepey, but</li>
            <li> I would have expected some minimal positive outcome in 8 weeks, but there&#x27;s been no visible improvement.  </li>
            <li> very dry skin became soft and moist like a baby.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s too soon to say good or bad</li>
            <li> Seeing results slowly but definitely worth the money</li>
            <li> I usually use this after I got done with the shower (where i wash my face) and place this on and using just a little can go a long way and my skin feels super soft.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a month in conjunction with other all natural organic products.</li>
            <li> It leaves me with softer smoother looking skin and doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate my skin like other products do since I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> A little really does go a long way.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was REALLY EXCITED when this product came up on my discounted site!</li>
            <li> Have only used for a couple days so will have to update on how well it works and how long the results last.</li>
            <li> I have used some in the past that make my face feel really sticky</li>
            <li> I am a 41-year-old female with minor lines and wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I am a 53-year-old female with minor lines and wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> The bottle will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely continue buying this product as long as I keep getting these results.</li>
            <li> I use the Hyaluronic Acid serum facial moisturizer, I took part of the promotional sale to try the products and I am a life long customer.</li>
            <li> My skin routine is pretty basic, and I&#x27;ve noticed a subtle improvement using this.  </li>
            <li> After washing the face and applying a tonic for my normal/dry skin and letting it dry, I have applied the serum on the areas described above.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s erased my dry patches, shrunk my pores, and it has reduced my oily spots because it gives enough moisture to keep my skin hydrated all day.</li>
            <li> IM 43 YR OLD BLACK WOMAN</li>
            <li> Having said that, I would definitely recommend it for those with dry skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a few days, but my skin feels soft and it&#x27;s glowing.</li>
            <li> After using it for a couple months, I ended up using every single last drop.</li>
            <li> Been using it for over a month, a little bit goes a long way --have sensitive skin and have had no issues at all.</li>
            <li> I have used several different Serum&#x27;s and have been in the market for a new one since the one I have previously used is not available anymore.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes my skin for a long time.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin soft and firm.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been using it too long yet, but my face is softer.</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with my Steamcream day and night, and I have noticed plump skin that stays supple all day long.</li>
            <li> As I have aged, I have found that serums are essential to keeping my wrinkles at bay...</li>
            <li> then that I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see other effects.</li>
            <li> I have fine lines on my face &amp; neck &amp; have been desperate to reduce them before they turn into deep crevices.</li>
            <li> I live in the mountains and the water is very harsh on skin here</li>
            <li> have tried other hyaluronic  acid in different delivery systems......in lotions, creams, etc.  </li>
            <li> I plan to be their customer for a long time!</li>
            <li> This product is very similar to other hyaluronic acid serums I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have other brand, same serum that works as well as this one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Have not felt any itching or stinging sensation, but the skin felt very stretched out.</li>
            <li> I have not been using this product for very long, but I am already seeing the benefits.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t been very long that I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t dry my skin out either.</li>
            <li> All my life I have had dry, flaky skin, and</li>
            <li> I let the serum dry</li>
            <li> I think it helps reduce redness and dry skin patches.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be diminishing my pores somewhat and my skin does not feel as dry or flaky.</li>
            <li> let dry</li>
            <li> I got this serum during a special event, and being skeptical about these types of products I thought why not...</li>
            <li> Being a nutritionist myself, I&#x27;ve spent a small fortune on several organic and natural products with little to moderate results, but this is so affordable and</li>
            <li> My skin has a habit of breaking out&lt;br /&gt;a lot and it usually takes me quite awhile to clear up...</li>
            <li> So far I can see a small difference with the fading of brown spots.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first, as with any new product, but I had to try it, atleast for the introductory price.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels firmer without feeling like it&#x27;s being stretched!!  </li>
            <li> Used regularly with the vitamin C serum, my skin starts to look less wrinkly.</li>
            <li> I have noticed my pores are smaller next to nothing as usual</li>
            <li> I have used about half of the bottle, I can&#x27;t say that I see a big difference since using Hyaluronic Acid Serum</li>
            <li> the lines have gotten less deep.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m about half of the way through the bottle &amp; am starting to see results.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin on my forehead that flakes and peels off as if it is sunburned.</li>
            <li> It has helped my skin stay clear and after it dries it almost makes your skin feel a little tight,</li>
            <li> Just a little for big results.</li>
            <li> And the little wrinkles around my mouth are starting to disappear.</li>
            <li> everybody has a different view of what little means when it comes to the amount of something</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not plumper and my one tiny age spot hasn&#x27;t faded even a little bit.  </li>
            <li> on what i put on my face down to even what makeup i wear and have found that alot of products out there with with all those long name chemicals wreak havock on my skin ( dry it out or itchy feeling etc.) and show no positive difference as if i never used them.</li>
            <li> The area looks healthier and firmer after using this product regularly for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> You only need a few drops, spread it on your fingertips and place on your face.</li>
            <li> Product came quicker than expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used a few days</li>
            <li> Using the Hyaluronic Acid as cleared the rough patches and the color is no longer pink and the patches are no longer itchy.</li>
            <li> This has convinced me that I cannot use anything remotely acidic on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I learned to apply the serum immediately after washing face, while face is still WET NOT DAMP.</li>
            <li> Though thick it&#x27;s clear</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for a few days</li>
            <li> ; i got my item faster then expected delivery date.</li>
            <li> So it will be rough to find a replacement.  </li>
            <li> I am 74 and have a few deep wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Have spent hundreds of dollars trying to find something that works.  </li>
            <li> I have only used for a few days and already notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I received them faster than expected</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for a few weeks, and have noticed a big difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I just received the product, only using it a few times.  </li>
            <li> It sinks in and I also like to mix other actives with it</li>
            <li> As I have gotten older then have gotten worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m noticing less patchy dry areas with this and the vit c serum and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit of this serum goes a long way, my skin just drinks it in.</li>
            <li> As they say, a little goes a long way...</li>
            <li> You dont need alot of the product ( a little goes a long way).</li>
            <li> When I ran out of one, I started using the other.  </li>
            <li> The Vitamin C Serum and the Hyaluronic Acid Serum complement each other and can be used together or interchangeably.  </li>
            <li> also I&#x27;m vegan and extremely cautious about what I put in my body and on my skin.</li>
            <li> absorbs well, can&#x27;t say that I see any difference other</li>
            <li> I have used other serums and do not break out.</li>
            <li> forward to trying their other products!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is one of 2 items ( the other is the Vitamin C Serum)</li>
            <li> I can apply it before all of my other products (moisturizer &amp; makeup) and have no problems whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what other people call it, but it&#x27;s two deep lines running vertically between your brows</li>
            <li> .which by the way is lasting longer than I thought…It just takes a small amount.</li>
            <li> Over the past weeks this serum has brought back the elasticity to my skin.</li>
            <li> and I had wanted to add the other ingredients that comes in this one.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 2 weeks and feel my skin is smoother, however I am in my mid 60&#x27;s so not sure if it can work miracles.</li>
            <li> and I have had other serum&#x27;s</li>
            <li> You only have to use a small amount to achieve the desired effect.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it a few days, and I can already see a change in my skin!</li>
            <li> This comes in a generous 1 oz bottle, and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> AS A LOT OF THE OTHER POSTS STATED.</li>
            <li> It leaves me with softer smoother looking skin and doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate my skin like other products do since I have senstive skin.</li>
            <li> I do have to use this every other day or my face breaks out.</li>
            <li> Other</li>
            <li> I have been extremely please with the results of this product.  </li>
            <li> I see a difference in my skin in only a few days!</li>
            <li> I actually noticed a difference in my skin after just a few days!</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be a little on the dry and flaky side and the lotions I&#x27;ve tried just seem to make my skin oily on the surface, but still flaky.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised by this product - it was very thick, unlike other serums I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> but I found the Hyaluronic and the Vitamin C Serum from this company a little thin as I had to use twice as much as another brand</li>
            <li> It does not smell bad like other serums and it dissolves easily in the skin.</li>
            <li> I get dry, flaky skin on my face, so I&#x27;m always looking for products that will moisturize, without feeling sticky or heavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted, I have been using these serums in place of branded serums that are much more expensive.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to try this because my face is very sensitive and dry.</li>
            <li> My crow&#x27;s feet and other lines appear to be much less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> These days its hard to know which products are necessary to use.</li>
            <li> BUT I HAVE ACNE SCARS THAT ARE DARK</li>
            <li> I like that this serum is a little thinner then other acid serums</li>
            <li> I use it every other day and my face is clearer than ever!</li>
            <li> It is a little thicker than other serums I have used.</li>
            <li> dark circles seem to be less noticeable.</li>
            <li> No more dry flaky skin.</li>
            <li> The dropper cap doesn&#x27;t work half the time, I just have to run my fingers down the syringe to get the product.</li>
            <li> …My sister came to spend a few days with me (we had not seen each other in 2 months)</li>
            <li> It only takes a very small amount.  </li>
            <li> However, after using it for less than 2 weeks, my skin feels softer &amp; firmer and my eye puffiness/</li>
            <li> I have worn less foundation since I started using this product.  </li>
            <li> And this product has improved my pores, lines and wrinkles by making them less noticeable.</li>
            <li> and I used to contantly pick at pimples and black heads.</li>
            <li> I also have less breakouts since using the Hyaluronic Acid Serum and</li>
            <li> and I went thru half the bottle in a week.</li>
            <li> Have less after two weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I can already see results in less than a week.</li>
            <li> Less.</li>
            <li> and I have less noticeable acne scars on my legs.</li>
            <li> and I have to use much less foundation.</li>
            <li> It has less redness and it also feels softer.</li>
            <li> i look in the mirror and see that the fimne lines also look much less moticeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even been using less makeup.</li>
            <li> , however, i Have some little dark spots on my face</li>
            <li> I had dark spots on my face because of my pregnancy and 4 mos postpartum, my skin looks so dull and dry.</li>
            <li> I emailed them at least three times in the week they were shipping, just asking how to order, why the shipping wasn&#x27;t working, why my package was in a town for so long,</li>
            <li> My wrinkles are a little lessened and skin seems a little smoother.  </li>
            <li> I even feel a little tingle on my face after applying, but no redness.  </li>
            <li> I like this serum as it does not irritate my skin like other vitamin C serums in the past.</li>
            <li> I wanted  to use it a little bit before reviewing .</li>
            <li> I feel like my skin looks a little fresher too.</li>
            <li> As recommend, I started by using just a little bit of the serum.</li>
            <li> It has been a little over a month</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little over 3 weeks now</li>
            <li> I have now been using this product for a little over 2 months</li>
            <li> I have always thought my complexion was a little ruddy looking b4.</li>
            <li> it seems to be a little firmer.  </li>
            <li> The lines down the sides of my nose to my mouth...GONE!  </li>
            <li> It is thick and a very little bit goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see the results after using it for a few months.</li>
            <li> Just a few drops in the desired areas and you&#x27;re finished.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> I look forward to using it everyday.</li>
            <li> Both of these conditions have improved in just a few days.</li>
            <li> and I could see the difference in the suppleness of my skin in just a few days.</li>
            <li> i used a few days</li>
            <li> I have ordered it a few times and would recommend it for anyone if even if you dont have wrinkles.</li>
            <li> The serum dried my face out..</li>
            <li> but it still does not feel heavy on your skin.  </li>
            <li> Using both the vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid serum has firm and improve the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> I used a lot of different Hyaluronic acid serums they were thin this thicker and works well.</li>
            <li> and I use just a few drops each day.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 weeks now and my skin is smoother and it has even smoothed out my uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Hyaluronic Acid Serum for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> You can feel this working after a few applications.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> I have used them everyday since receiving them.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> I use Hyaluronic Acid everyday and it is like a facelift in a bottle.  </li>
            <li> Made my skin red and was not happy with it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months.</li>
            <li> and I have seen the difference in my skin after just a few days usage.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday....</li>
            <li> Compare with my 2 other bottles of Hyaluronic Acid Serum, this is a little bit thick and a lot of bubbles inside the bottle.</li>
            <li> I seem to have less breakouts than I had before!</li>
            <li> It is very thick so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because this little bottle to replace is expensive and being on a limited income, it would be hard for me justify continuing buying it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get her to put it down</li>
            <li> It is a little bit on the thick side, but I think it makes it spread over your skin easier.</li>
            <li> Just a small amount is all you need .</li>
            <li> From squinting I have noticed small creases on my forehead, but since using this those creases have minimized.  </li>
            <li> My skin was brighter and smoother sheet after just a few applications!</li>
            <li> Use it everyday!</li>
            <li> After a few uses I can see noticeable results!  </li>
            <li> I am also taking phytoceramides so not sure which or both is working.</li>
            <li> not sure what the difference is</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about results yet since I just started using it about a week or so ago.</li>
            <li> He usually notices the changes in me before I do.</li>
            <li> I was not satisfied with this product at all.</li>
            <li> Am receiving unbelievable results.</li>
            <li> I have small lines and wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have applied it before bed for the past two nights and when I wake up, I feel like my skin is rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> My skin responded by filling out small lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Usually in the am whereas I use this after each face wash before moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I like the texture as I wanted it to be not like water.</li>
            <li> I am not sure</li>
            <li> My wrinkles are less noticeable!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s brighter &amp; perkier not so dull.</li>
            <li> I ordered it late Friday night, it arrived Monday morning.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 50&#x27;s and</li>
            <li> My skin sucks it up as I apply it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the gel has any fragrance in it, at least none that I can detect.  </li>
            <li> It is a thick gel</li>
            <li> I keep these refrigerated as to slow the oxidation that happens once these beauty&#x27;s are opened.  </li>
            <li> The Hyaluronic Acid Serum is thick.</li>
            <li> No more flakes!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t mean I have to look like it, right?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i mean EVERYTHING.</li>
            <li> Been using for a few days, have seen a dramatic difference in my appearance.</li>
            <li> I am noticing a subtle difference in my skin after using this for about two weeks, both morning and evening.  </li>
            <li> , I am on my second bottle and the results are dramatic!!  </li>
            <li> This product is working wonders on my dull, tired, cruddy-looking neck skin.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s dull and unhealthy looking.</li>
            <li> It was not a good product for me.  </li>
            <li> And never kept a regular skin care regimen, so I have enlarged pores a plenty, marks, dry patches, horribly oily T-zone, and anything else you can think of.</li>
            <li> Does&#x27;nt pill under makeup, and seems to already be improving the dull appearance of my skin!</li>
            <li> I have pretty boring skin, no breakouts and no glow.  </li>
            <li> The texture is very thick</li>
            <li> My under eye skin seemed thin  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I saw the ingredients label with a long list, plus it has a scent, which means that&#x27;s another ingredient I would not want in my Hyaluronic Acid.</li>
            <li> Product is quite thin.</li>
            <li> I annoyed them purposely.</li>
            <li> It is a thicker serum, and when it arrived I was afraid it would be heavy on my oily skin; however it is not.</li>
            <li> Each bottle lasts me approximately a month, using it once a day in the morning.  </li>
            <li> SERIOUSLY!</li>
            <li> I have seen dramatic improvement in my skintone.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s ineffective and ridiculously expensive.</li>
            <li> Sadly did not see any difference.</li>
            <li> I used to look really scary in the morning.</li>
            <li> I wished it would have agreed with my skin, but unfortunately it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with that price!</li>
            <li> Give it a try , you won&#x27;t be sorry !</li>
            <li> I am very skeptical about beauty/rejuvenating products.</li>
            <li> However, by day five it made my skin break out badly from face to chest.  </li>
            <li> When using anywhere else I breakout really bad.</li>
            <li> I have severe Eczema and always have issues with serums as some can cause my skin issues to get really bad.  </li>
            <li> I did not have any bad reactions to it.</li>
            <li> :-(</li>
            <li> Rather disappointed in that</li>
            <li> about the secret!!!  </li>
            <li> I was shocked!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I think this is a great product!  It has made my skin feel softer and has noticeably reduced a wrinkle on the right side of my face..I would recommend using this and have in a video I made about on YouTube.  It&#x27;s a great product...could be a little less runny though!  I have sensitive skin and this product did nothing to irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great serum that goes on, penetrates, and is overall wonderful</li>
            <li> I bought both Best Vitamin C and Acid Serum.  When I ran out of one, I started using the other.  I live in the mountains and the water is very harsh on skin here so I always put this on after a shower and then I use Organic Olive Oil as a natural moisturizer.  I&#x27;m 28, so I don&#x27;t SEE a difference, but it feels like it works.  They have a light scent and feel great on the skin!</li>
            <li> This serum is great. It absorbs into your skin quickly so you can put your moisturizer on. It also leaves your face feeling smooth and tight. What more could a woman ask for.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Makes my skin smooth,soft and reduces pores. No irritation when I use this product, I Love It!!</li>
            <li> nice and light; leaves skin smooth.</li>
            <li> I ordered this twice because it did not last longer than a couple of weeks. I would order it again if it lasted longer.</li>
            <li> I love how my face feels when i use this serum, clean and looks shiny and gives me a youthful appearance which i love</li>
            <li> This product is one of the best hyaluronic acid serums I have ever used!  My skin has improved immensely and my wrinkles have gotten alot less prominent.  Even my husband has noticed a difference!  Absolutely love it!  I totally recommend it!  Thank you so much!!!</li>
            <li> My face and neck are looking so much hetter.. great product.</li>
            <li> I love this product within 2 weeks I have noticed a substantial improvement in the fine lines on my face</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time trying it and yes, I would recommend this product. They answered my questions quickly and were helpful regarding uses for their facial serum</li>
            <li> A little watery compared to most hylauronic acid products I&#x27;ve used. It seems to help hold the moisture in pretty well though, given its natural organic ingredients vs chemical ones. Inhabe very sry Colorado skin though and need something stong! Only thing I would love to see changed is the carregaean from being used. Buy otherwise enjoyed this product overall!</li>
            <li> A Wonderful Serum moisturizer! High quality too.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love how this makes my skin look and feel! Thank you for giving me the opportunity to try this wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I love both serums from &amp;#34;Joy and Karma&amp;#34;, thanks. :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a short time, but my skin is soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> I have been using this in conjunction with Vitamin C Serum By Joy and Karma and am very pleased. These products really work ! My wrinkles  were smoothed out within days. Just a small amount is all you need . It worked for me !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week and I see an improvement in texture.  I like that this serum is a little thinner then other acid serums, it feels lighter after it dries.  Since you put moisturizer on after, this is a good plus.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift to my girl friend. she likes it a lot saying it is better than the one she used before. I will buy this again for her again</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with my mind. In particular, no skin troubles while using very satisfying week.&lt;br /&gt;supplement the vitamins, giving the skin elasticity to make my skin.&lt;br /&gt;If you have not used the product, I hope to use it now.</li>
            <li> Gave yo friend, they loved and purchased more.</li>
            <li> I can feel my skin tighten as I apply the acid serum to my face.</li>
            <li> takes just a drop, applies very easy, my face does not feel dry after applying, always use a night creme after applying, but really like it</li>
            <li> I received a discount to try this and boy, am I glad! This feels really good on my skin and keeps it from being as dry. I would buy this again. Used regularly with the vitamin C serum, my skin starts to look less wrinkly. Deeper lines start to get softer.</li>
            <li> I like this serum. I have been using this product for over a month in conjunction with other all natural organic products. I like how it makes my skin feel. I have also noticed a decrease in the fine lines on my forehead. I am also pleased that this serum is made in the USA.</li>
            <li> Good product, slow delivery when faster shipment/receipt was advertised, Thanks,</li>
            <li> Iam very happy that I tried this product, in just a week my skin feels so much smoother and just nicer. Very happy !!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product along with the Vitamin C and I apply it at night.  I am happy with the results and it is helping my dry skin look much better!  I love that this is a natural product too!</li>
            <li> Fantastic  seems to be working on decreasing my pores</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing ! I use it in my oxygen facial machine and works wonders for my skin! Vitamin C serum also is super great.</li>
            <li> I have pretty boring skin, no breakouts and no glow.  My skin routine is pretty basic, and I&#x27;ve noticed a subtle improvement using this.  My wrinkles are a little lessened and skin seems a little smoother.  I appreciate that it&#x27;s light and not gross feeling.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product !!! I find my skin moisturized after applying the serum. I do use a moisturizer after the serum but I could get away without using one.</li>
            <li> Love it and will def repurchase</li>
            <li> great stuff after 3 days i can already see good result it really makes my face soft and younger looking..im so happy</li>
            <li> Now I have been using this product for almost 16 months and I am completely satisfied with the results and ordered another 5 bottles.  I use it on my face, neck , chest and thought I would try on my upper arms. Who knows ? Great product  Thank you Joy and Karma</li>
            <li> I have been using your serums religiously for the past couple weeks, I love the way it absorbs quickly, my skin looks and feels softer and most importantly younger. I am loving it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much,&lt;br /&gt;Linda</li>
            <li> It feels nice. It moisturizes my skin for a long time. I like it.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and hydration of this product. Will order again!</li>
            <li> Awesome is the only word I can use for this ... I love how my face feels</li>
            <li> The product does as described and my skin feels really, really good!</li>
            <li> Love this Serum, I really helps my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good serum. It is very thick so a little goes a long way. It doesn&#x27;t have a smell. It feels a bit like wearing a facial mask once it dries though. That was my only problem with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
            <li> Great product--Great buy---Prompt delivery---Would buy again FOR SURE !!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I got this through a promo and started using it right away.  I actually wash my face at night and then rub this all over my face and sleep in it, when I wake up my skin feels softer.  So far so good.  I do not feel any tightening of the skin just a softer skin, what I use to tighten my skin is Reviva Labs 10% Glycolic Acid Cream.</li>
            <li> I have been using this nightly for a couple of weeks now and I can honestly see a difference. The few deep creases I have in my face seem to have filled in already.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT serum.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It keep my skin soft and hydrated</li>
            <li> Product  is great. Skin feels good with it</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! I love it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I have only been using this product for about two weeks and have been using it at night after washing my face and using toner. So far I can see a small difference with the fading of brown spots. I will continue using this product and update my review. I would definitely buy this product again!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Notice a difference with this product - works great as a moisturizer, and does not leave skin feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> This has definitely made a big difference in my skin! It&#x27;s now so much smoother. I simply add it to my moisturizer everyday :)</li>
            <li> This product is working wonders on my dull, tired, cruddy-looking neck skin. The area looks healthier and firmer after using this product regularly for a few weeks. The skin on my face is acne-prone so I have been using this on my aging neck and am very happy with the results. I have very sensitive skin and have experienced no itching, burning, redness or other allergic reactions to this product. I can thus recommend it without reservation.</li>
            <li> I have used this serum for about 2 weeks and am very pleased. I use it twice a day. In the morning under a sunscreen day lotion and at night under an organic night moisturizer. Skin appears brighter and firmer. Seems to do the job of other hydralonic serums that cost 5x&#x27;s as much. Also, has vitamin C which is a plus.</li>
            <li> I got this serum during a special event, and being skeptical about these types of products I thought why not...it is nearly free. I love this serum. In the first week of using, the fine lines on my face are almost gone. My skin looks smoother and softer, and I could not be happier with the results. I will continue to use and purchase this product in the future.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it.  Made me buy 2 more lol.</li>
            <li> Good choice... Good acid serum..</li>
            <li> I love this product!!  smells wonderful, and it feels so good when applied.  Soaks right in, not greasy at all.  I even feel a little tingle on my face after applying, but no redness.  Can&#x27;t wait to see the results after using it for a few months.</li>
            <li> Have noticed some difference in  my facial appearance.  Not so much a lightening of dark spots, but an overall more smooth appearance.  Did notice a much more noticeable lightening of dark spots on my hands, though.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum twice a day and have noticed that my skin is gradually starting to look better. The serum does not dry your face out, but leaves it feeling soft and well moisturized. Love that it&#x27;s an anti-aging product that is not broken up into tedious steps. Just a few drops in the desired areas and you&#x27;re finished.</li>
            <li> Light weight and easily absorbed. My skin felt fabulous after using it. Super moisturizing!</li>
            <li> I love the Hyaluronic Acid Serum as a facial moisturizer!  It is the best and I highly recommend everyone should try it!  It left my face feeling very smooth.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  It seems to do what it says.  My skin didn&#x27;t need much in the way of repairs per se anyway, but this serum definitely seems to make my skin even softer and has helps diminish the few dark/hyperpigmentation marks I have on my cheeks from allergic reactions.  I use it in conjunction with my lemon oil and night moisturizer and my skin is awesome!</li>
            <li> I truly love this product.  After using this I have noticed that my skin is firmer and much more resilient.  I have just started using this and can already feel and see the difference.  From squinting I have noticed small creases on my forehead, but since using this those creases have minimized.  You will a slight tingle when first using the product but other than that this serum is amazing.</li>
            <li> Excellent merchandise/packaging/seller!! Highly recommended!! An asset to Amazon!!</li>
            <li> Can I just say this is the BEST product I have ever used on my face!!  I have been using this twice a day for about five weeks, I am on my second bottle and the results are dramatic!!  I had deep lines on my forehead that if I went from my hairline to my nose, I could catch with my fingernail.  Not any more!!  They are gone!!!  The lines down the sides of my nose to my mouth...GONE!  The lines around my lips... Almost gone.  I have also been using it on my neck and chest.  Much improved!!  I will tell you that I am also using a 1.0 mm derma roller about three times a week.  I will always have a spare bottle of this in my closet because I don&#x27;t ever want to have to worry that I might not have it.  Thank you Joy and Karma for a wonderful product!!</li>
            <li> The best serum that I have used.</li>
            <li> Just have to say I highly recommend this product! My pores are usually large and my foundation does not go on smooth, after only two of using this I have noticed my pores are smaller next to nothing as usual my skin looks smooth and flawless and wrinkles are a bit less I&#x27;m certain this will become part of my skin care regimen great product!!!</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS VERY NICE,IT MAKES MY SKIN FEEL LIKE SILK. I EVEN HAD A COMMENT FROM MY FRIEND THAT MY SKIN LOOKS SO SOFT .I HAVEN,T NOTICED ANY WRINKLES CHANGING BUT, I,VE JUST BEEN USING IT FOR 3 DAYS .I,VE EVEN ORDERED 2 MORE FOR MY FRIENDS TO TRY. ITS A VERY NICE PRODUCT, I WILL BE ORDERING IT AGAIN WHEN I RUN OUT, WHICH VERY LITTLE GOES ALONG WAY I MIGHT ADD.</li>
            <li> Excellent Hyaluronic serum. You only need a few drops, spread it on your fingertips and place on your face. Comes in an easy to use eye dropper bottle. You can feel your skin tighten right after putting it on! I am very pleased with this serum.</li>
            <li> A good product so far.  Goes on smoothly and seems to absorb well; have only been using it for a couple of weeks.  I apply right after washing and allow several minutes for absorption.  Am very impressed with the quality of their customer service.  I had an issue and they resolved it promptly, courteously and then followed up to make sure everything was good.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this serum.  My skin is dry and I find that it helps to  hydrate my and skin and smooth out any fine lining.  I like the texture of this product.  My moisturizer works with it very nicely.  The serum is not greasy.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I just love this serum, I have been looking for such a produst for a long time and believe that good things come to those who wait! Most hyaluronic products are mixed in some kind of creme. This was so smooth and after just a few weeks I can see fines lines becoming less. Thank Joy and Karma for such a great product. I will never be without!</li>
            <li> I just got yesterday but seems my skin brighter and smoother. I want to use more.</li>
            <li> This serum feels awesome on my skin!</li>
            <li> Delivered on time........ very moisturizing, reasonable price, good texture...........It&#x27;s perfect for me!</li>
            <li> This serum is fantastic! It absorbs quickly asks i can wear it under moisturizer and make up. My skin was brighter and smoother sheet after just a few applications!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! Makes my face look so smooth. I also put it on the back of my hands to plump and smooth the skin. Great value. I use before my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love love love it wish I had bought 2. This serum makes my face feel so smooth. I use it every night.</li>
            <li> Light and refreshing. Love the way it feels on my face....</li>
            <li> Arrived rapidly!  I&#x27;m giving a 5 stars for that. Have only used day &amp; night for 3 days so can&#x27;t give much opinion.  My skin feels good though!  I&#x27;m excited to see results!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a few weeks now. The texture of my skin has softened. I like this serum as it does not irritate my skin like other vitamin C serums in the past.</li>
            <li> I put this on at night and my skin is so soft and tighter in the morning, you only need a couple drops</li>
            <li> I have used this only a short time but so far I like the way my face feels smooth after using.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality product</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  It makes your skin feel wonderful.  I highly recommend this product by this seller!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for exactly one month and have already re-order 2 more bottles of each,  I&#x27;m using the Vitamin C serum along with the Hyaluronic Acid serum and my skin feels fabulous!  I&#x27;ve had a sensitivity to other skin care products and made sure that I used the Vitamin C for 5 days with out reaction before I added the hyaluronic acid serum and it&#x27;s been love ever since.  I am seeing some differences...smaller pores and lines aren&#x27;t as deep.  I&#x27;m going to continue to use this as it definitely makes my skin feel great!!</li>
            <li> Love it! One day and I can tell. I may get more now that the price is low.... This is a must.. ! I have tried others.. Thank you for a great product! Get this..even my hands look better after one use. I hope to get another before the rates went up.. shared with all my friends. Great company</li>
            <li> Great product! My skin is much softer and smoother, this absorbs quickly, feels so nice on my face.</li>
            <li> I like this one because it is a bit more thick than the other serums that I have tried. I have yet to see any visible results yet. However, after using it for less than 2 weeks, my skin feels softer &amp; firmer and my eye puffiness/dark circles seem to be less noticeable. I am going to keep using as directed &amp; keep my fingers crossed. I would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> The serum make the skin very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this! It&#x27;s the best brand around --- Will always buy this brand! Fast Shipping too!</li>
            <li> Excellent product - noticed a difference within a week of usage.</li>
            <li> Seeing results slowly but definitely worth the money</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve used.  This is a huge part of my everyday beauty regiment.  Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> This is the second product I have tried from Joy and Karma, and I am really enjoying it. A little bit of this serum goes a long way, my skin just drinks it in. It&#x27;s a high quality product, and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin soft.  Helps skin soak up facial lotion, excellent product!</li>
            <li> There is no trouble serum. good</li>
            <li> It is best product. very effective.</li>
            <li> This is the best hyaluronic acid serum. I love it.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t tell yet how it is working</li>
            <li> I liked the Joy &amp; Karma Vitamin C serum, so when I was given the opportunity to purchase the Joy &amp; Karma Hyaluronic Acid Serum at a promotional price, I was happy to be able to try the two products together and share my experiences.  The Vitamin C Serum and the Hyaluronic Acid Serum complement each other and can be used together or interchangeably.  The Hyaluronic Acid Serum is made from natural products and is packed with antioxidants.  I cleanse my face, then apply the Hyaluronic Acid Serum.  Next, I apply the Vitamin C Serum. I&#x27;ve been using these products for several weeks, and my skin is soft and smooth.  I&#x27;m impressed with this serum, and love how it moisturizes my skin.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this a few months ago.  I used it all and then tried one of the big name brands that costs 3 times as much and promises great results.  I can honestly say that this one is so much better!  I have tossed out the big name junk and will be using this from now on.  The lines on my forehead and around my mouth are almost gone after using this.  I really like that it is natural, organic and NOT tested on animals.  I know everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but as someone with thin, sensitive skin I can honestly say that I have never been more pleased with a skin care product!  Just want to add that I ordered more and will continue to from now on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the serum about 3 weeks and I see results already.  Others have commented so I&#x27;ve referred them your way. Thank you.</li>
            <li> The dropper cap doesn&#x27;t work half the time, I just have to run my fingers down the syringe to get the product. I love the product, it absorbs fast and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky. I like the way my skin appears to stay hydrated longer.</li>
            <li> I am such a fan of Hyaluronic Acid serums, but have had some that don&#x27;t work as well as others. This brand works well. I use this brand on a daily basis and follow up with the same company&#x27;s Vitamin C serum. You will be impressed with these products.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several weeks now and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  I can see improvement with my facial lines, and it is a great moisturizer.  It doesn&#x27;t go on sticky and absorbs well.</li>
            <li> Love it ! Fast shipping. Great price!!</li>
            <li> Well, I used to use different serums that contained hyaluronic acid but the Joy and Karma serum is the first organic that I&#x27;ve tried. After 3 days I noticed that my skin is a lot more elastic, supple like a plumbed bean and in addition, it became very hydrated. Has a pleasant smell and extends on your face very smoothly in a second. I use it in combination with vitamin C serum during the morning and the night. So far, excellent product and I suggest it to others.</li>
            <li> This is the best on the market!  I have very sensitive skin and have no reactions but good ones. My skin is super soft and the fine lines are fading! I would highly recommend this for every age.</li>
            <li> Delivery was great . This is the ultimate skin need. Pair it with the vitamin c and that&#x27;s all you need.  Thank you joy and Karma for being a reputable company with wonderful products at good prices!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!&lt;br /&gt;Makes my skin so soft!!</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this product!!! I want to buy it all the time!! My face is so much smoother and I see my imperfections disappearing!! Please buy this product and just try it....I promise you will love it!!</li>
            <li> Attractive packaging.  Great product!!</li>
            <li> This serum has a wonderful texture on the skin, feels great and protective. I have been told that I look years younger.</li>
            <li> I Received this product free along with the vitamin C and and I really did see a difference with the fine lines and the races around my mouth and under my neck, I recommend getting both products ..</li>
            <li> lovely feel to your skin after using, will keep it up!!</li>
            <li> Love this my skin feel amazing</li>
            <li> I have worn less foundation since I started using this product.  It has improved color and consistency of the skin on my face. I will replenish my supply when it runs out :D</li>
            <li> I wanted  to use it a little bit before reviewing . I use this in combination with their vitamin C serum and I have gotten so many compliments on my skin. The serum is oderless and not heavy . It feels good on the skin and pairs well with my moisturizer. I notice after 1 week , my skins texture is nicer and plumping up .</li>
            <li> Love this product!  It made my skin so soft and smooth.  It really penetrated deep into my skin!</li>
            <li> I love it! There is such a great improvement in my skin since I started using the serum! My skin is brighter pores smaller and clearer! Great product! Will buy again! AAAA++++</li>
            <li> Product came quicker than expected. I&#x27;ve only used a few days and I can tell my skin looks firmer and some of the fine lines in my forehead and crows feet have disappeared. If I continue to see these results I&#x27;ll definitely reorder ! I&#x27;m 35 and am starting to need a product like this. My mom is 67 and I sent her one as well :-) also I&#x27;m vegan and extremely cautious about what I put in my body and on my skin. I&#x27;m delighted to find a product like this !!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I use it every other day and my face is clearer than ever! I seem to have less breakouts than I had before!</li>
            <li> The product was as described...a quality serum that made my skin look and feel healthier.</li>
            <li> Great product, saw results after one night,my face felt and looked smooth, minimized the appearance of fine lines and pores. This product was sent to me at a low price in exchange of a review, and I can honestly say I will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  It didn&#x27;t dry my skin out either.</li>
            <li> The product works with initial contact. It smooths your skin and gives skin a soft glow. It did not irritate my skin. I am a 41-year-old female with minor lines and wrinkles around my eyes. I also have smile lines and mildly dry facial skin and slightly large pores. The customer service for this company is spot on. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Been using for about three weeks. Instantly noticed the hydration it gave me, also have noticed my deep glabella lines between eyebrows have diminished. This is now part of my routine!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the results I have gotten with the Joy and Karma Hyaluronic Acid. I have sun induced psoriasis. Using the Hyaluronic Acid as cleared the rough patches and the color is no longer pink and the patches are no longer itchy. Over all my skin look great!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a week and I feel that my make up goes on smoother.</li>
            <li> Perfect start to my day when I use this. My face hasn&#x27;t felt smoother and been more clear.</li>
            <li> Just started using this. I think I love it.</li>
            <li> The Joy and Karma spreads nicely and soaks into my skin leaving it feeling silky smooth. I also like the way it smells so fresh and clean. I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> have tried other hyaluronic  acid in different delivery systems......in lotions, creams, etc.  I like this the this serum makes my face feel. Doesn&#x27;t take much . As they say, a little goes a long way...Thank you joy and karma !!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on a promotion and loved it so much, I purchased it again.  Since I am allergic to the world and don&#x27;t like using personal care products that contain chemicals that I can&#x27;t even pronounce, I really like that this serum is 98% natural and 72% organic. I will definitely purchase this serum again!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, it makes my face feel so good and skin smooth, I have seen some progress around my eyes. I only gave it 4 stars because this little bottle to replace is expensive and being on a limited income, it would be hard for me justify continuing buying it. A wonderful product, keep up the good work.</li>
            <li> Love this for my face!  It feels so good and can tell it makes my face look healthier.</li>
            <li> I have been taking care of my skin for years (just turned 50) so it&#x27;s in pretty good shape. I believe in using serums and love the way JK feels, not sticky, dries quickly and sinks in fast. I have used about half of the bottle, I can&#x27;t say that I see a big difference since using Hyaluronic Acid Serum but I will keep using it. I only paid $1.50 for my bottle, there was a fb special promotion (i think it was on fb). You can&#x27;t go wrong with that price! Shipping was fast too! I don&#x27;t know that I would or could  pay full price.......If I see a big difference when I run out then I would make it work so I can purchase it!</li>
            <li> bought as gift no complaints</li>
            <li> very nice~~!! I iove it.</li>
            <li> It has been two weeks since I started using this product. This definitely helped my skin look young and feel smooth. I had dark spots on my face because of my pregnancy and 4 mos postpartum, my skin looks so dull and dry. I am happy that I found this product! I get a lot of compliments of how my skin looks so smooth and feel soft! Together with the hyaluronic serum, wrinkles around my mouth area started to fade, as well as the wrinkles on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for letting me try this product and giving a huge discount!</li>
            <li> Love the way this feels I can tell that it really works</li>
            <li> so cool.&lt;br /&gt;it moistures  even the driestn skin.</li>
            <li> This product works very well.  I love the way it makes my skin feel.  Also, it does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:349e24e3b6bb57b085ed7fcc66d8464c]] I love hyaluronic acid serums because they work so well, are extremely gentle, help lighten dark spots, most effective at treating eczema on my baby&#x27;s skin, is very clean with no residue, doesn&#x27;t clog pores and doesn&#x27;t have any smell.  It&#x27;s a very clean formulation that is extremely effective.  Excellent for oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyedropper is not my favorite type of dispenser because I need two hands to use it and there is a chance at spilling the bottle or contamination when it&#x27;s open but it&#x27;s not a big deal.  Good packaging and great product!</li>
            <li> This serum is so gentle on the skin but has amazing results.  I got my first compliment yesterday!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product! It is a little thicker than other serums I have used.</li>
            <li> Product has no smell, so that is awesome!  Goes on well; when you apply the drops the product doesn&#x27;t run.  I have been using it for 4 days and my face feels smooth and have not experienced any break outs.</li>
            <li> my skin is more clear and soft</li>
            <li> Serum is exactly as described. Goes on smoothly &amp; absorbs quickly. I am 42 &amp; have been using it morning &amp; night for about 2 weeks. I already notice a difference in smoothness &amp; pore size. Great product!!!!</li>
            <li> I love the texture because it&#x27;s not sticky.  Recommended</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all. I don&#x27;t even think it deserves one star.</li>
            <li> good price, thank you</li>
            <li> Love this serum. I use it in the morning and in the evening. It soaks into my skin perfectly. Leaves no tacky feel and I can already tell a difference in how my skin looks and feels. My dark spots are lighter and wrinkles less prominent.  I look forward to using it everyday. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Leaves my skin glowing and have noticed some of my fine lines softening.</li>
            <li> I am noticing results after only one week!</li>
            <li> This is a nice product. It is lightweight and not greasy at all. I feel like my skin looks a little fresher too. It arrived very quickly as well. Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> The formula did work well in clearing some old scarring when I first used it. However, by day five it made my skin break out badly from face to chest.  I&#x27;m sure this will work wonders for someone who has skin that is not too sensitive, who just needs a little moisture boost.  This has convinced me that I cannot use anything remotely acidic on my skin.  Couldn&#x27;t even finish the bottle, and now I have to purchase something else to counteract the damage this has done.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. Not only does my skin look and feel better, but I was also having problems with some adult acne and age spots. Both of these conditions have improved in just a few days. I am a believer.</li>
            <li> Great produt at a low prize!</li>
            <li> An essential part of daily care for the face. Helps the facial skin feel smoother.</li>
            <li> I love this serum! Really plumps up my sunken in eye area and I have noticed my lines filling in on my neck and not as prominent.  I am very happy with this purchase and will buy again. Recommend to the nature aging woman!!! Thank you Joy and Karma!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Fine lines are becoming less noticeable and my skin looks refreshed. I highly recommend purchasing this product!!!</li>
            <li> I use this serum with the Vitamin C serum. Skin feels fresh. It definitely helps my moisturizer penetrate deeper and I could see the difference in the suppleness of my skin in just a few days. It&#x27;s a wonderful, simple addition to my skincare routine and my skin is softer and brighter. I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff if feels good on my face you dont need a lot and actually I have been rubbing it on my stretch marks I feel l like it is helping.</li>
            <li> I get dry, flaky skin on my face, so I&#x27;m always looking for products that will moisturize, without feeling sticky or heavy. This serum does just that. It is a little bit on the thick side, but I think it makes it spread over your skin easier. I only need to use a tiny amount for my entire face, and I focus on the areas that are the driest. It absorbs quickly, and my skin feels hydrated. I add another layer of my regular moisturizer and apply my makeup as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have flaking skin, this may work for you as well. The price is right, and the bottle will last me several months.</li>
            <li> the delivery was quick i used a few days i was able to tell the diffrence right away my face is smoother i will tell everyone to try thanks</li>
            <li> Works great!! I&#x27;m very happy with it!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a week now, at night before I go to bed.  I am not one to do a lot for skincare, but this is easy.  I just put it on after I shower and then go to bed.  My skin feels more hydrated and tighter than it did before I started using this moisturizer.  It is a thick gel but it absorbs quite quickly and it is easy to apply as well. I am very happy with it.  It was worth every penny!</li>
            <li> absorbs well, can&#x27;t say that I see any difference other I have no little dry patches anymore (but it is summer)</li>
            <li> First thing I loved about this was that its 98% natural and 72% organic next thing was the fact it wasn&#x27;t runny most serums are. I love the fact that it didn&#x27;t have an overpowering odor to it.It made my skin softer smoother my pores smaller I was shocked!! I have become a big fan.It wasn&#x27;t heavy or greasy it can only get better from here.</li>
            <li> Love love love love this serum!</li>
            <li> I love it!! It made such a difference!! Use it everyday!</li>
            <li> When I love gifts for friends too. Thank you for this joy to me.</li>
            <li> My face feels and looks so much smoother and brighter since I started using this product</li>
            <li> my particular skin didn&#x27;t agree with this product. However, I was refunded all the money and was allowed to just keep the product.  So I recommend the company, but the product wasn&#x27;t good for me.  Not saying  it won&#x27;t work for you.</li>
            <li> The product shipped fast!  After a few uses I can see noticeable results!  I am excited to continue using!  I have used serums costing 7X as much and I am more pleased with the results from Joy &amp; Karma!</li>
            <li> So far I am very pleased with the results although I&#x27;ve only been using the products for a few days. My skin seems to be &amp;#34;brighter&amp;#34; and very soft. I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles but the few I have I hope to see greatly diminished with continued use. Great products!  I highly recommend this and the vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> good price good product</li>
            <li> So far this product is one of the best products I have ever tried. I am a 53-year-old female with minor lines and wrinkles around my eyes. I also have smile lines and mildly dry facial skin and slightly large pores. On my first application I notice that the JK Hyaluronic acid serum hydrates my skin and relieves the dry pulling tension associated with dry skin. This product is highly moisturizing and it helps to keep my skin moisturized and hydrated throughout the day while wearing it under my daily moisturizer. This serum is rich and silky. It is not sticky and doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance in my opinion. The consistency is just right and you apply it onto your skin using an eyedropper. It&#x27;s not messy and it goes directly where you place it. And this product has improved my pores, lines and wrinkles by making them less noticeable. My facial and neck area looks much more healthy meaning that my skin is not dull, dry and flaky. My skin looks more youthful meaning that it looks brighter and dewy and it is not at all oily or sticky. I absolutely love this product and I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> havent noticed much over all change but its only been a week. but does make your face feel good right after you put it on</li>
            <li> Great serum! It makes my skin soft and firm. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> This product goes on well and works great under makeup</li>
            <li> I love Hyaluronic acid serums. I believe my skin has brightened from my using this serum. Looking forward to future use for even better results..</li>
            <li> This is the first Hyaluronic Acid Serum I have ever used and I really like it.  I use it daily under moisturizer and makeup along with the vitamin C serum.  I am 62 and have my share of wrinkles and lines but this product helps to plump those areas so makeup doesnt settle in.  I have ordered it a few times and would recommend it for anyone if even if you dont have wrinkles.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Received on time. Love the product!&amp;#34;  Will continue to purchase.  Have noticed a big difference in the appearance of the skin of my face and neck!</li>
            <li> I initially gave this product 1 star. The serum dried my face out.. I decided to do some research before tossing the 2 bottles I had. I learned to apply the serum immediately after washing face, while face is still WET NOT DAMP. Next I apply vitamin c lotion to lock it in.   This works much better. I do see slight improvements with very fine lines I have. I am also taking phytoceramides so not sure which or both is working. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I had to try hyaluronic acid serum and see what all the talk was about! These days its hard to know which products are necessary to use. This particular one is a must for my staying young arsenal!! My skin is brighter and smoother. I also noticed my age spots fading!! Overall a younger healthier appearance! Just a little for big results. I purchased this product at a BIG discount. In return I gave my personal review.</li>
            <li> I it can see a noticeable difference since using this syrup. My skin is smoother and lighter.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a week and so far I love it. It leaves me with softer smoother looking skin and doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate my skin like other products do since I have sensitive skin. I love the glow that it&#x27;s been giving me.</li>
            <li> I just started using it over a week ago. I only use it on my forehead and eye area. When using anywhere else I breakout really bad. I have used other serums and do not break out. I also tend to look greasy the next day after washing my face. I think this will be a great product for our Iowa winters, but does not work during these humid days of summer if you have oily skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a week and love the way it is making my face look and feel. Will highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for about 2 weeks now and OMG I love it.  I can truly see the difference in my skin..so much more smoother and softer.  I have been using it on my face and neck and also my hands...can t forget them either.  I am so happy with this product and can t wait to see the long term use effect it has on my skin...</li>
            <li> I am using this along with Vitamin C serum and I love it.  My wrinkles are less noticeable!! Great product!</li>
            <li> I have severe Eczema and always have issues with serums as some can cause my skin issues to get really bad.  After using this product for almost a month - I am so impressed with how my skin feels as well as how well it has worked with my skin too.</li>
            <li> Again, another amazing from J&amp;K.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much like the vitamin c serum, this one produced a very nice change the in the quality of the face and neck skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shared this serum with my Mom, just to have a true way to see the change without combining serums on me. Her skin noticeably changed not long after using it, gaining back some of its natural elasticity and healthy glow. It&#x27;s hard to get her to put it down now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone looking to help improve the quality of their skin should look into investing in a bottle o Joy &amp; Karma facial serum.&lt;br /&gt;A++</li>
            <li> I used this at night on my face and neck. I noticed that in the mornings my skin looked much smoother and my fine lines disappeared so much that I started using it on my chest where I have a few sun spots starting, they are slowly disappearing too.</li>
            <li> So glad I&#x27;m using this. My under eye skin seemed thin  now I don&#x27;t notice the fine wrinkles when I smile. I use it every day</li>
            <li> So great for dry saggy skin. Goes on smooth and clean. It works !!!! I absolutely recommend this for everyone !</li>
            <li> I love the way this feels. Though thick it&#x27;s clear and it&#x27;s really helped with my rosecea.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been using it too long yet, but my face is softer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a good girl and feel that I deserve some good karma. I&#x27;m glad I came across this serum. As recommend, I started by using just a little bit of the serum. Wow! I could already see a difference on my skin. I can only imagine if I also use their moisturizer. Definitely going to look into that.</li>
            <li> A great product have not used long enough to see results yet.</li>
            <li> I have been using this along with the Vit C Serum for a few weeks and my skin is looking better than it has in years! I have VERY sensitive skin and have been looking for a long time for something that my skin can tolerate and that actually improves my skintone. This is it! It is thick and a very little bit goes a LONG way. I don&#x27;t even use the dropper, I just get some off the side of the dropper. I have seen dramatic improvement in my skintone. I now go without foundation most of the time. IN PUBLIC!!! I don&#x27;t have a problem with wrinkles, yet, but this combination of serums has made my red splotchy skin go away!! I will keep buying this.</li>
            <li> I really like this.  I have been using it for three weeks now and my skin is very hydrated and supple.  Skin texture looks more even.  I have been using it first at night and then putting my anti wrinkle cream on top for added benefit.  It seems to be working great and I have had many issues with break outs in the past with different moisturizers, but this has not caused a one.  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this product, it&#x27;s light and I&#x27;ve seen a difference already. My skin appears plump. I didn&#x27;t have wrinkles except my forhead and they have filled in noticeably. I look hydrated! I used EGF as my vehicle with daily salicylic wash. And now I&#x27;m going to add vitamin C as my brightener. Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> so far so good, doesnt sting</li>
            <li> I love this.. I&#x27;ve only had this for a few days but i can see a big difference already.. My skin has a habit of breaking out&lt;br /&gt;a lot and it usually takes me quite awhile to clear up...I&#x27;ve tried quite a few different products that really don&#x27;t seem to make much difference...I&#x27;m very impressed and will definitely buy this ..It works well and very fast</li>
            <li> I have fine lines on my face &amp; neck &amp; have been desperate to reduce them before they turn into deep crevices. I&#x27;ve been using Lancome for a while but it&#x27;s ineffective and ridiculously expensive. This serum moisturizer is awesome!! My fine lines are softened to the point of almost nonexistent and my skin radiates! I LOVE it! Bonus is that the seller is highly communicative, courteous and prompt.</li>
            <li> I can tell this serum is really helping my skin retain moisture. My skin tends to be a little on the dry and flaky side and the lotions I&#x27;ve tried just seem to make my skin oily on the surface, but still flaky. I was not expecting to actually notice any difference, but I was very pleasantly surprised. I think I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer than anyone...</li>
            <li> Has made my skin brighter and tighter!</li>
            <li> Love it. My face seems softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> Due to this product it is also then saw a very good effect on the purchase decision</li>
            <li> I enjoy the product. My skin is more moist and supple. The serum goes on light without any greasy residue. The scent is very light and refreshing and not overpowering like some beauty products.</li>
            <li> There is a lot to like about this product.  I have been using this along with the vitamin c serum one at night and one during the day and i love them both.  This one is a bit thicker than the vitamin C serum but it still does not feel heavy on your skin.  This product also has not irritated my sensitive skin which is something I have to look out for, it goes on easy absorbs quickly and makes my skin feel good.  Give it a try.</li>
            <li> I love hyaluronic acid serum is not watery.  I am using both hyaluronic acid serum &amp; Vitamin C together.  I tried the vitamin C alone for a couple of days, then added hyaluronic acid serum.  I love the combination of the 2.  I am rating both a 5!  I am seeing a difference in the smoothness of my skin, can&#x27;t wait to see what continued improvements I will get with wrinkles!</li>
            <li> It is a very good product.&lt;br /&gt;I love it. My skin was very dry skin became soft and moist like a baby.&lt;br /&gt;Good day, feeling the skin, there is fun to see in the mirror every day.&lt;br /&gt;Once again I would like to also buy.</li>
            <li> This is a really great product. Leaves your skin fell clean and lightly moisturized!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Very, very nice product. Glad I gave it a try! Thanks. forward to trying their other products!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Although I have only been using this for a week, I must say that I love it.  There has been no irritation on my sensitive dry skin and it has really improved moisturization.</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels on my face and I actually think I see a difference in my face....not sure what the difference is but I think there is a difference. I will use this over and over....</li>
            <li> This product so far is beyond what I hoped for. I am 62 years old and take very good care of my skin. However, old age does creep up on you &amp; the fine lines I do have (very few) this product works amazing on. My skin is smooth &amp; it makes me look way younger than my age. Thank you for this wonderful product. It will be in my daily regimen of skin care. I am so glad I got to try this a a reduced price.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product and helped my face over time</li>
            <li> great product love Joy &amp; Karma!</li>
            <li> I love this formulation !!! It&#x27;s a powerhouse that really performs ! Only great ingredients no junk fillers or additives and mostly organic. My skin has a nice  glow , it&#x27;s very  hydrated (not greasy) and I&#x27;ve noticed more elasticity to my skin as well as major wrinkle reduction and pore&#x27;s are minimized as an added bonus its clearing up some hormonal acne. I found youth in a bottle :)  I keep these refrigerated as to slow the oxidation that happens once these beauty&#x27;s are opened.  I also use the Vitamin C formula too</li>
            <li> After using the serum for 2 weeks, my skin is so much softer and smooth. I had lines at the corner of my eyes and now I can barely see them! This product makes my skin look youthful and it gives me a glow! I will definitely buy more of this product!</li>
            <li> Very good company to work with. I made a mistake ordering and they really helped.  My face feels so smooth already!</li>
            <li> I love it, you can feel the difference and you can see the difference.  Thank you Joy and Karma, another fantastic product!</li>
            <li> Great serum. It absorbs really well. I know that vitamin c is great for over 40 skin. Vitamin E helps wrinkles as well It doesn&#x27;t leave a film like some other serums and my moisturizer glides over it very easily. Really fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li> This product is alright, and probably does wonders for others, but my skin just did not react well to the formula.  Within a minute or two of application, the skin on my face began to tingle and then burn just a bit.  My neck and chest were perfectly fine, but my face felt like it had a mild sunburn.  I am not blaming the product though.  I think it might have reacted to my facial wash, which has pomegranate and grapefruit in it.  I do love the smell of it, which smells like roses. Although I really do love the smell of this product, in all honesty, I rather prefer their Vitamin C Serum to this formula.</li>
            <li> First of all ordering through Amazon was a good experience, the serum arrived pretty fast. I decided to begin using this serum once a day in the morning and than probably using it at nigh as well in about 14 days. Since I just received it, can&#x27;t give a full review, these are my first impressions. The serum comes in a 30 ml glass bottle with a pipette type dispenser. The amount is generous, but the consistency of the colorless, see-through serum is thick, so if it is used according to the instructions on the face neck and décolletage, the amount needed is as well more. After washing the face and applying a tonic for my normal/dry skin and letting it dry, I have applied the serum on the areas described above. After the serum totally dried on my face the skin felt very smooth and stretched out. Have not felt any itching or stinging sensation, but the skin felt very stretched out. I applied a daily moisturizer, exactly as mentioned in the instructions as the serum is not meant to be used on his own, but in a combination with a day or night cream. After the moisturizer sunk in my skin, it felt very smooth, elasticized and hydrated. 3 hours later I applied my regular foundation to see how does it look. I am very pleased with the results, as my makeup looked excellent. The foundation stays on very well, there is no sign of slipping or oiliness, the serum had a smoothing effect and calming effect on my skin. Getting back to share my final thoughts in about 2 weeks. Cheers!</li>
            <li> This is a great product I will use it with a all organic and natural moisturizer I take a lot of medication and I think this will work great for me. Thank You Joy and Karma for giving me choices.</li>
            <li> I decided to use this product in the evening! i wake up looking very bright and for the 1 week i have been using this my skin is so clear... my daughter also love this!</li>
            <li> Love the way ti feels on my skin.  Very nice and I would buy it again!  Wonderful, wonderful product highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Upon initial use, I found the product to be of a water type texture and not thick. After use, found my skin to be super soft.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum in combination with the Vitamin C serum for 2 weeks now and I have really noticed a difference in my skin. I have noticed the fine lines around my eyes and mouth have decreased and my skin has an overall better tone, texture firmness and glow to it. I have been applying twice a day to face, neck and chest, in the morning and before bed. I am not a person who has a glamorous skin routine. Just a wash and go kinda girl, and this has been easy and quick with amazing results. Would highly recommend to others!</li>
            <li> I like that it goes on light and absorbs fairly quickly.  It isn&#x27;t sticky or tacky.  After using this I apply my moisturizer &amp; I don&#x27;t need to use as much moisturizer.  I&#x27;m not sure about results yet since I just started using it about a week or so ago.</li>
            <li> I have bee using Best Hyaluronic Acid Serum for a few days now, and I must say that it feels different from anything I have ever used before.  It&#x27;s only been a few days, but my skin feels soft and it&#x27;s glowing.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!!!</li>
            <li> This is one of 2 items ( the other is the Vitamin C Serum) that I got from Joy and Karma and I was impressed and its hard to impress me. First the Shipping &amp;#62;&amp;#62; i got my item faster then expected delivery date. Second &amp;#62;&amp;#62; The Hyaluronic Serum comes in more of a gel form then liquid so i was skeptic about the easy speadablity and the absorbing of it BUT it spreads very well and absorbs with no feeling or residue of it on the skin like some other products out there so i was HAPPY with that. You dont need alot of the product ( a little goes a long way). And third &amp;#62;&amp;#62; I love the ALL natural/organic bases of the product. Im picky on what i put on my face down to even what makeup i wear and have found that alot of products out there with with all those long name chemicals wreak havock on my skin ( dry it out or itchy feeling etc.) and show no positive difference as if i never used them. After 3 days of use with this i noticed a positive difference. Looking forward to see what the next product will be from Joy and Karma.!!!!!</li>
            <li> I like the Joy and Karma line- I have used their Vitamin C Serum and now this. The Acid serum is a little thicker than I had anticipated but that was fine with me, took a few seconds longer to absorb but I might have been a little heavy handed when using the dropper ( which I love for an applicator ) I like that it has no scent. When it is on you do not feel it so you do not feel like you had globs of stuff on your face when you add makeup or anything else after the serum. The Acid Serum is silky smooth which I like. Makes me skin feel like a million bucks and it looks like it too.</li>
            <li> Been using for a few days, have seen a dramatic difference in my appearance. Clearing up my acne and smoother skin. Does not burn was the biggest thing. Highly Recommende</li>
            <li> using the product.  My skin is incredibly changing getting fine lines and discolorations out.  Arrived on time, and the price awesome.</li>
            <li> I used Joy and Karma&#x27;s vitamin C and really did not notice a big change in my skin, but once I added the hyaluronic acid serum I seen a huge difference in just three days...highly recommend both these products.</li>
            <li> I rally like this product!,,&lt;br /&gt;I apply the hyaluronic acid and I use a Vitamin C cream followed by serum.</li>
            <li> I only just started using it ,but so far it seems to be working. Time will tell.</li>
            <li> I have been using the serum for just about a week now. It appears that this serum drys out my skin a bit more than other products however, my skin tone and appearance does appear more even. I am going to give it a few more weeks to see if skin hydration becomes less of a problem.</li>
            <li> I love these products.</li>
            <li> Using both the vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid serum has firm and improve the texture of my skin. I had to keep using for a while to see results.</li>
            <li> Joy and Karma have got a handle on it with the quality and effectiveness of their products.  I got this along with their Vitamin C Serum and instantly felt a wonderful tightness forming on my face and neck.  My skin was soft, yet tight, and fine lines looked less obvious almost immediately!  This was my first purchase of this and the Vitamin C Serum and I can tell you it will not be the last, I am now a devoted Joy and Karma customer and feel this product could not be more deserving of the 5 star rating!  If you want to keep your face looking and feeling young or help reduce aging that has already occurred I highly suggest you purchase this product!</li>
            <li> I like this so far.  It sinks in and I also like to mix other actives with it so I have a specialized serum.</li>
            <li> Works well so far. Feels great. Boxed looks good. Have only used for a couple days so will have to update on how well it works and how long the results last. Received right away.</li>
            <li> - I have been using the Hyalutronic Acid Serum for about a month now. I can see results with using the product . My skin looks and feels softer and I feel it has helped my skin to look younger.</li>
            <li> I ordered this through Amazon and received it in lightning speed time! I have been using the product for several weeks now and LOVE it! The texture is very thick so I don&#x27;t need a lot to cover my entire face. After use, my skin doesn&#x27;t feel sticky, tacky, or greasy. I can apply it before all of my other products (moisturizer &amp; makeup) and have no problems whatsoever. It has really done wonders for improving the smoothness and texture of my skin. Sooo silky soft now and I love it! :)</li>
            <li> I love this product it made my face look healthier. I am using this every day along with the viatmin C.I highly recommend it. The package arrived very fast.</li>
            <li> I love it! I have been getting compliments on my skin since using this product. A must to your daily routine!</li>
            <li> Love love love this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m started using the Joy and Karma hyaluronic acid serum facial moisturizer in the evening and the Joy and Karma vitamin c serum in the morning, these products feel amazing on my skin and no break outs!!  I have only used for one week but I am noticing my the hyper pigmentation starting to look lighter. I can&#x27;t wait to see the continued results. Great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this a little over a week along with the Best Vitamin C serum from J&amp;K as well. So far I have noticed that my skin is a lot smoother, a lot softer and looks very healthy. I was not expecting to notice any difference so quickly. I use them once a day, at night.&lt;br /&gt;I was my face first, then I use the Hyaluronic Acid Serum. I use probably three large drops to cover my entire face and neck. I let it soak in for about five to ten minutes and then I use the Vitamin C Serum after. I let that soak in for about five to ten minutes as well and follow with a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;The biggest change I have noticed to far is on my forehead. I have very dry skin on my forehead that flakes and peels off as if it is sunburned. I have tried many different things to help. These two products together have made that difference. My skin is no longer flaking and peeling. I&#x27;m truly amazed!&lt;br /&gt;The last thing I have noticed is the difference in the &amp;#34;tomahawk&amp;#34; mark between my brows. I&#x27;m not sure what other people call it, but it&#x27;s two deep lines running vertically between your brows that is more noticeable when you furrow your brows. As I have gotten older then have gotten worse. Now that I have started using these products I have noticed the lines have gotten less deep. I think this has to do with the hydration from these serums plumping my skin back up.&lt;br /&gt;If you have been on the fence about trying this out, you should. Along with the Vitamin C serum. I&#x27;m amazed by my results from just a week and am very excited to see more as I continue the use.</li>
            <li> I am using this  as my facial moistuizer,goes on silky and smooth has reduces some fine lines but I would buy it again!!!! Im Happy  Thank you Joy and Karma for letting me test and review!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is a wonder to help moisturize my skin. All my life I have had dry, flaky skin, and I have to use good moisturizers to cure it. I was reading up on hyaluronic acid, and I found that they can help keep moisture in the skin. I am also on a mostly natural kick, so I was very very please with the ingredient list. I use this in conjunction with my Steamcream day and night, and I have noticed plump skin that stays supple all day long. No more flakes! I 100% recommend this without any hesitation.</li>
            <li> I was excited to see if it would make a difference in the appearance of my skin tone. I first used the serum without moisturizer to see if my face would dry out and while it felt fine, it felt even softer after using moisturizer. My skin tone has improved and my fine lines are just about gone. I ordered this and the Vitamin C Hyaluronic Serum and they came within 2 days packaged in bubble wrap to keep them safe.</li>
            <li> Theses products aré verry good. Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 1 week. My husband is pleased with the results.He usually notices the changes in me before I do.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and I can see results instantly. Soft, smooth glowing, even skin is what I have now. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product! My fine lines around my mouth and my crow&#x27;s feet have diminished. I would purchase this again!</li>
            <li> I have used this serum for 28 days now. It was very sticky going on, and I found that you had to use more than usual, to cover the entire face and neck. I have not seen any reduction in wrinkles, but have notice a softer and plumper feeling to the skin. It did not do for me what the ads said it would do. I was not satisfied with this product at all.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this serum. Ordered it and Vitamin C serum. Am receiving unbelievable results. Fast delivery. Excellently packaged. Brand new bottle. Quickly seeing amazing results. Try it. You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waiting a few weeks to write this review because I wanted to give this product a good test drive, and I feel like i&#x27;ve had enough time using it to give my honest opinion, and let me say I am in love. My skin is in pretty bad shape by most standards, I have a nervous condtion and I used to contantly pick at pimples and black heads. (Gross, I know.) And never kept a regular skin care regimen, so I have enlarged pores a plenty, marks, dry patches, horribly oily T-zone, and anything else you can think of. I started using this, along with the Vitamin  C Serum, and it has changed my skin in an incredible way. It&#x27;s erased my dry patches, shrunk my pores, and it has reduced my oily spots because it gives enough moisture to keep my skin hydrated all day. It only takes a tiny amount to do the job so even after using it twice a day for almost 3 weeks +, i&#x27;m not even 1/4 of the way through both bottles. And when I do run out, I will purchase this continuously. Fan for life. &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> It totally does what it claims.My skin has improved since I started using it.&lt;br /&gt; I will buy again !Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother and firmer. I also have less breakouts since using the Hyaluronic Acid Serum and Vitamin C Serum combo!!&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend both products!</li>
            <li> I have purchased two different kinds Hyaluronic Acid Serum and JK is much well worth the money! First it is not as watery as the other brand, and it really makes my skin look radiant and supple, love it!</li>
            <li> I really like your product .... not so sure if it helps me to look better yet but I love the texture and I hope in a long run it will make my skin better...!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much ... Danielle</li>
            <li> As a woman on the fast train to the age of 43, I am always looking for great products for my face to keep it looking fresh and young. I love this stuff! It feels good going on and is not heavy or make me break out. I love it!</li>
            <li> Use this and the vitamin c - great stuff and I love how it helps my skin look better.</li>
            <li> Use it twice a day, love it!</li>
            <li> Best facial serum I&#x27;ve used to date.since I first purchased it I&#x27;ve been using it every night.What a significant difference in my skin .love this product would by again</li>
            <li> I have chosen to re-review this product and the reason is simple. I had originally only gave it and the accompanying Vitamin C serum 4 out of 5 stars. My reason for this was because I had only tried them alone for a short period and personally could not see much difference although others could. My next step was to add my nightly moisturizer and was amazed. I found that my moisturizer seems to be accepted more readily by my skin and seems to be doing its job much more effectively. I love how my skin feels and looks now. I don’t even feel the need to wear anything more than my eyeliner and a light dusting of blush.

            <li> I love this product. I was using it morning and night and I went thru half the bottle in a week. I think I should only use it at night. My skin looks amazing. I have dry skin and my skin feels great all day long. I&#x27;m extremely impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> an excellent product.  I highly recommend</li>
            <li> I tried this hyaluronic acid for the first time and had no irritation whatsoever.  I also combined using this with Joy &amp; Karma&#x27;s Vitamin C serum.  I prefer the thicker consistency of this serum and definitely it&#x27;s lower price (as opposed to the Vitamin C&#x27;s).  I&#x27;m kind of a skeptic when it comes to serums, but I found that my skin did improve and felt wonderful.  I still have wrinkles, but they don&#x27;t seem as deep set.  I&#x27;m in my early 50s, and I feel like the serum took years off of my looks.  Up close, I still see the wrinkles, but further away, the wrinkles are definitely not as noticeable.  It&#x27;s got a light feel to it, although if you use a lot, it might feel a little sticky.  It dries quickly, so the sticky feeling is not for long.  One recommendation would be if J&amp;K gave more of a guideline about how much to use.  I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m using too much, just the right amount or not quite enough.  Overall ... a definite winner!  Also, J&amp;K&#x27;s Customer Support CANNOT be beat .. they are very responsive and extremely helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the fence with this product, their May promo has the price so affordable .. I think it&#x27;s worth a shot!</li>
            <li> Really nice serum smells and feels good the ingredients are all expensive and natural u gotta love ur skin and take care of urself lol just saying</li>
            <li> I use this Hyaluronic Acid serum before bed after washing my face, and before moisturizing.  It already seems to help add an extra layer of moisture and absorbs within seconds.  I also love how you only need maybe 2 drops for the entire face and neck.</li>
            <li> I use the hyaluronic acid serum with the vitamin C serum and it helps keep my skin moisturized all day.  Great product!</li>
            <li> The best product in 2014. I love the appearance of my skin since I have been using this product.</li>
            <li> This Hyaluronic Acid Serum is not harsh at all. It is gentle, has no odor, doesn&#x27;t irritate or sting my facial skin. I use it in conjunction with their Vit. C Serum, just alternate days. I layer it under my moisturizer, my sunscreen and/or my foundation. It&#x27;s gotten to where I don&#x27;t mind going out of the house without actual makeup! I would highly recommend Joy and Karma&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product. I was hoping to see some softening of stubborn lines around my mouth. It has softened those lines. I also have noticed noticed that the skin on my neck appears firmer. I wasn&#x27;t expecting that.</li>
            <li> Great product. I really see the difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> It really works. I use it for lip wrinkles. Have less after two weeks of use. Can you make a bigger bottle so I don&#x27;t have to keep reordering?</li>
            <li> Sadly did not see any difference. Did not see improvement in hydration levels on my face.</li>
            <li> I love how soft my skin feels after just one use. It even has my first name on it so it must have been made for me! Lol joking. My skin looks very smooth and clear. I plan to order more in the future</li>
            <li> Very good~ i love it♡</li>
            <li> awesome product, awesome service</li>
            <li> Great product.  Love how my skin looks.  No more dry flaky skin.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great product :)&lt;br /&gt;I use the hyaluronic serum in my professional treatments .Its a great hydrating serum, it goes on the skin very nice &amp; smooth .. I like also the fact that it&#x27;s mostly organic&amp; natural .. It&#x27;s always a benefit for the sake of health!&lt;br /&gt;Will order if again :)))</li>
            <li> This moisturizer worked better then anything I have ever tried before.</li>
            <li> Seems like  a nice product.  Waited a while so I could give this a fair review.  To be honest I am in search of a replacement for Perlabella HA which is no longer available.  Perlabella HA reversed signs of aging and even felt different on my skin that most HA products.  So it will be rough to find a replacement.  This product is better at plumping than Wyatt, Indeed, and Hada Labo HA products that I have tried though.</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my face feel!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this product - I would recommended it to anyone</li>
            <li> Hydrating and not drying or sticky! One of my new favorites. I love the way it feels on my skin and it absorbs great. The product has no scent and had a convenient dropper..</li>
            <li> It has been a little over a month and I have friends who are asking me what I am doing different …My sister came to spend a few days with me (we had not seen each other in 2 months) and she wanted me to &#x27;give it up&#x27;….talking about the secret!!!  I notice an even tone to my skin and a glow, yes, a glow! I am 61 yrs. old and an ex-sun worshiper, so I needed all the help I could get….This stuff is magical and I can see me ordering more when this bottle is empty…….which by the way is lasting longer than I thought…It just takes a small amount. I am so excited about this stuff and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to soften there laugh lines and crows feet and have that all around healthy look.</li>
            <li> I really like the way that the serum absorbs and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy.  I have seen some reduction in the fine lines around my eyes and lips.  It has a very lite scent that fades so you aren&#x27;t smelling the product all day.  It only takes a very small amount.  The bottle will last a long time.  It comes safety sealed in box.  It is completely clear.  It states on the instructions that if you use a toner, to use toner first, then serum and you can apply your moisturizer and makeup over the serum.  It didn&#x27;t interfere with my makeup application.</li>
            <li> it arrived on time, my face has never looked better, I get many compliments on my face.. something i will for sure keep buying!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this serum. It leaves my skin feeling tighter and smoother. It has helped with the fine lines around my eyes. It sinks right into my skin, without feeling greasy or sticky. My skin has never looked better. I&#x27;m extremely pleased that you don&#x27;t need to use much, and my first bottle lasted a really long time. Thank You Joy &amp; Karma :-)</li>
            <li> I am a new user of this stuff-I like that it is mostly organic and natural.  My skin just drinks it up, and it feels smooth and soft.  I have only used this for a couple weeks, so I can&#x27;t really tell if it makes a difference in the fine lines yet.  Joy and Karma offer helpful hints and are very supportive of their customers.</li>
            <li> Love all of Joy and Karma&#x27;s products!!!! So happy I found them.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical when I first purchased this product, but I am now a believer, many other serums I had tried always left my skin sticky and looking dry or crepey, but not JK, it went on smooth and absorbed quickly leaving my skin ready for moisturizer. I loved that it didn&#x27;t leave a film or residue like most other serums I have tried, that speaks volumes about this product alone.&lt;br /&gt;I  love that i the two months that I have been using it my crows feet and fine forehead lines have softened, and my skin is brighter and more radiant.  I also love that I can pronounce the ingredients and know what I am putting on my skin! I will definitely be purchasing this product again and suggest anyone looking for something that does what it says with no icky smell or residue give it a try , I bet you will love it :)</li>
            <li> Over the past weeks this serum has brought back the elasticity to my skin. It&#x27;s brighter &amp; perkier not so dull. I am enjoying the youthful properties it&#x27;s giving me</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin so I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m able to use this without any issues. Many creams and serums burn but this is very gentle and feels great on. I already have pretty clear skin, but sometimes it dries a bit from the harsh Texas weather so this seems to be helping to replenish the moisture.</li>
            <li> I put this on in the morning under hte moisturizer. It is smooth and it actually got rid of some of the redness on my cheeks and nose that would not otherwise go away. Made my skin look and feel great.</li>
            <li> OMG ,  I order this in March and wanted to wait before I post my review .  This facial moisturizer is great.  Let me tell you, 1st important for me , no Oder, only needs a few drops at a time.  Ladies, it Absorbed quickly and didnt leave a Residue on top of the skin .  This is a must have</li>
            <li> I heard about this product  through different co workers. I actually ASKED someone if they had done something different with their makeup. She said &amp;#34;actually yes, I didn&#x27;t wear any today (she is 43)! She looked incredible so I asked her what she was doing differently and she told me about this product. Said she had used it for 2 weeks at that this point and this is the first time in over 15 years that she felt confident enough to not wear a face full of foundation/powder and concealer! Needless to say, I was REALLY EXCITED when this product came up on my discounted site! I ordered it late Friday night, it arrived Monday morning. Today is Tuesday and after using the product last night for the first time I am looking forward to the changes ahead. I am 38,and can not wait for the morning that I wake up, look in the mirror and say &amp;#34;who needs makeup? Not THIS GIRL!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It leaves my skin feeling so smooth and is non-irritating!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I can feel it tightening my skin as soon as I put it on.. I love it. don&#x27;t know how I did without it..&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Despite all the good reviews, this product just didn&#x27;t work for me. It&#x27;s day 3 and I&#x27;ve been using it once per day at night after toner before moisture, and it&#x27;s giving me break outs. I guess this product is not working for all skin types.</li>
            <li> Love it and very fast shipping.. Every thing I hoped for.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful, high quality product from Joy and Karma. I love the packaging, bottle top and ease of use. A light scent, non oily with oodles of added Vitamins to keep my skin smooth, supple and young. I am heading to 40 but take care of my skin. This amazing Serum helps me to care for it. Wonderful.</li>
            <li> I love this serum.  I used a lot of different Hyaluronic acid serums they were thin this thicker and works well. My lines are looking smoother softer. Skin looks radiant.  Love it#</li>
            <li> I love the hyaluronic acid serum.  It works great on my face.</li>
            <li> Super moisturizing!  Perfect for aging skin!  I loved that my face looked so well rested in the morning! Great product!</li>
            <li> I like the way this works. It makes my face look and feel younger.</li>
            <li> This serum is really great for my sensitive skin. I have small lines and wrinkles around my eyes. I also have smile lines and and some large pores. This serum is really moisturizing and hydrating my skin without making it feeling greasy and sticky. It is easy to apply on your skin with the eyedropper and because the consistency of the serum is slightly thicker it is easy to put it on without making a mess. I let the serum dry and my skin instantly feels smoother and just glows. After the serum I put on my daily moisturizer and I am good to go. The JK Hyaluronic acid serum keeps my skin moisturized and hydrated throughout the day. This serum is rich and silky but it doesn&#x27;t make me break out because my skin absorbs it. The serum has improved my pores, lines and wrinkles and my face and my neck look so much better. I really love this product and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  It goes on smoothly and easily and I use just a few drops each day.  I have seen visible results in my skins tone and feel--and if a skip a day or two, I can tell that the product actually worked to repair my skin rather than to simply cover it.  I have very sensitive skin and have seen zero issues with this product and love the way it makes my skin feel and look.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:1319afffcfce639cfed04ba1ea695039]]A month before I never knew what this product was about until I used some from my friend. I was on vacation in vegas and the temp was so hot that my face was so dry it started peeling and I needed something to help moisturize and i used this product and it helped it out so much. So after a few weeks I decided to buy myself my own and it has left my skin so nice and soft. I really don&#x27;t use that many face products just a face wash and some face lotion and that&#x27;s about it. Using this has made a huge improvement on my skin, i feel like it feels super soft. I usually use this after I got done with the shower (where i wash my face) and place this on and using just a little can go a long way and my skin feels super soft. I would definitely recommend this to someone who need more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum along with the vitamin c serum and finishing with coconut oil. I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is softer more hydrated. My fine lines are noticeably less apparent and the redness in my face is lessening. I&#x27;ve been using both products for a week. Love what they are doing for me.</li>
            <li> Like this product but it goes fast! Wish there was bigger container.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very nice item!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay full price. This does NOTHING for me.</li>
            <li> Great Item and Great seller. Highly recommended Item is just what i expected.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it makes my skin feel soft and smooth. I have been using it for a few days after my toner during my skin care routine and my face and neck already feel more hydrated and healthy. Shipping was also fast which is a plus :) Wonderful product, thank you!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!!!  On my second bottle</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and will be a forever user!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent source of Hyaluronic Acid Serum Facial Moisturizer!  I have been using the Hyaluronic Acid Serum for some time, but not this brand and I had wanted to add the other ingredients that comes in this one.  I can say that I have been using it and find that I love it and it is very well made and it has a very nice consistency as well.  So far my face continues to be very smooth and it moisturizes very well.  I am in my late 50&#x27;s and people will stop and ask me how I get my skin that looks this way.  For years I have used the Collagen Plus C and Hyaluronic Acid internally and then about a year or so ago I added the Hyaluronic Acid Serum to my facial routine.  Along with that I try and exercise and also eat a fairly healthy diet as well.  I don&#x27;t put much on my face at all except what is mostly organic and pure.  I use Organic Witch Hazel as a toner, then the Hyaluronic Acid Serum which I allow to thoroughly soak into my skin.  After that I use pure organic rose petal water and just spray all over my hair and my face and let dry.  With the added ingredients of the C and E and MSM the moisturizing is even better.  Amazing product and amazing company that makes this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 2 weeks and feel my skin is smoother, however I am in my mid 60&#x27;s so not sure if it can work miracles.</li>
            <li> This is a really great serum and really makes your skin feel great as well as filling in wrikles.  Easy to apply and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Delivered in time,works well with my skin type.I can already see results in less than a week.High-quality product.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! My skin feels so soft, and that makes my make up even better. Great for eye lines and wrinkles.  So much better skin texture. I love it!</li>
            <li> I love Joy and Karma products! I have been using this product for 2 weeks now and my skin is smoother and it has even smoothed out my uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> Dr. Oz recommends using these types of products for healthier skin and I can already, after just 2 days, see a difference. I plan to be their customer for a long time! It soaks into my skin and then, after putting a moisturizer over it, I have a beautiful glow. Since I&#x27;m 65 years old, finding a product like this is really important. Even better, I get lots of questioning looks. They don&#x27;t know what I did! Facelift? Facial? What??  They can&#x27;t believe it was this serum along with the Vitamin C serum.  I use this at night and the vitamin C in the morning under SPF moisturizer. Love it!</li>
            <li> Very good&lt;br /&gt;Thank you♡♡♡</li>
            <li> My skin and supple and looks amazing!</li>
            <li> I love this product and love the vendor ! I got in on this as a Facebook promotion and it was the best thing I have done. My face looks 10 yrs younger and since using this for only two weeks I have received numerous compliments from family and friends on my skin I can even go without foundation . I wish they made it for the whole body !!! Give it a try , you won&#x27;t be sorry ! Joy and Karma Rock !!  &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love it, I&#x27;ve been using it for two days only and it feels smooth and fresh</li>
            <li> No skin problems too good</li>
            <li> I love this serum. I have been using for a few days now and my skin all ready looks better. It feels great and my skin glows.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this serum!  I can definitely feel the difference in my skin tone. People ask me what I&#x27;m using and compliment me.</li>
            <li> Since 2 weeks I hve been using it and my face looks bright and shiny.</li>
            <li> Still waiting to see if their claims work for me</li>
            <li> I gave this moisturizer to my mom, she is older that 50 years old.... an thought she would really like it. an yep I was right she likes it and said she feel her face more soft.</li>
            <li> I received this as a VIP promotion.  Just as good as the Vitamin C serum. Has a thicker &#x27;gel&#x27; consistency, so it does take a minute to sink in. I now combine 5 drops of this and five drops of the C. Allover face and neck (even the backs of my hands) skin is visible smoother and hydrated. Seems firmer too. I love that their products use mostly natural ingredients, I have been looking at hydraulic and C serums but have not bought due to chemicals. These are a great alternative to those other chemical laden products.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little over 3 weeks now and I love what I&#x27;m seeing!  My skin is smoother and feels tightened and firmer.  Also, the lines under my eyes are not as noticeable and my eyelids also appear to be lifted as well.  I was hesitant to apply this serum to my eyes as this area is always so delicate, but there have been only positive effects--no redness, burning or peeling, so it&#x27;s very gentle, which is a definite plus.  I&#x27;m very excited to use this product long term as I know my results will be even better the longer I use it!&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I have now been using this product for a little over 2 months and I&#x27;ve never been happier with my skin!  I use this along with J&amp;K Vitamin C Serum and my skin looks and feels better than it ever has!  My skin tone has evened and it&#x27;s noticeably more firm, and I&#x27;ve noticed a huge improvement in the moisture level.  Love this stuff! It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
            <li> wonderful product. It is making my skin glow.</li>
            <li> Great product...great service!</li>
            <li> Please see review for Joy and Karma&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum--I included both products in that review. Short story--I love these products!</li>
            <li> all was perfect - well packaged and shipped promptly. thanks!  this is my 2nd bottle - love this! very moisturizing and improves skin texture.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Joy and Karma hyaluronic acid for a couple of weeks now. The serum is easy to use and adsorbed quickly onto my skin. Even with out the use of added moisturizer, my skin feels softer. I will continue to use this and see what else it can do.</li>
            <li> I am in my seventies and did not expect too much. After using for about two weeks I began to see a difference on my skin. My wrinkles have not disappeared but they are much finer and my skin looks significantly better.</li>
            <li> Not sure I noticed a difference after using but went on smooth. Still needed yo put moisturizer on.</li>
            <li> Its a good serum, and I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this serum!!!  My face is smooth and has a taut appearance. Friends are asking me if I had any &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; done and I tell them it is a serum and then give them the information about this product. I would recommend it to anyone who asks. It is well worth the price and I have had other serum&#x27;s that were far more expensive and did not work as well as this. Will definitely be reordering when it is time.</li>
            <li> This is a great basic facial serum - works well at softening skin - the price was very reasonable!</li>
            <li> OK, I waited a while to write this review, because I wanted to really try this product first. After having used it for almost 3 weeks. I have to say &amp;#34;This really works!!!&amp;#34; I didn&#x27;t notice it so much in my face, as I have few wrinkles there, but on the back of my hands ........ awesome improvement. I really don&#x27;t show my age a lot, except on the back of my hands. I have always been told that there is nothing you can do about that sign of age, but guess what ...... I found something that really helps a lot. My wrinkly skin is much smoother now and looks well hydrated. Love all the ingredients of this product and can only recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using ht for just over 2 weeks and can certainly see a difference in my skin</li>
            <li> As I have aged, I have found that serums are essential to keeping my wrinkles at bay...&lt;br /&gt;This product has been very helpful at plumping up my skin and reducing the fine lines on my face. For the deeper ones, it is not quite as effective, but I guess that is to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Lovely hyaluronic serum, somewhat between a liquid and a gel, absorbs quickly, does the job, good percentage, no scent. Not enough moisture for dry skin but great for oily skin, absorbs quickly, weightless.</li>
            <li> I love this product! My skin looks great and the peck is reasonable !</li>
            <li> Soothing to skin and absorbs well.</li>
            <li> I actually blended this with the vitamin C serum and I love the effects so far....my face is more clear and fine lines and wrinkles less noticeable</li>
            <li> Sooo helps my skin!!!!  Love it</li>
            <li> this stuff is great, i use it every day, its really helped my skin clear up</li>
            <li> It is OK. Compare with my 2 other bottles of Hyaluronic Acid Serum, this is a little bit thick and a lot of bubbles inside the bottle.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Less. Redness to my old face .  Is not sticky or stinky</li>
            <li> Has made my face feel so soft</li>
            <li> I no longer have to wear makeup on my face! After only a couple weeks of using this product my skin is absolutely glowing. I used to get a new pimple every day. Not any longer. My complexion is more even and the skin on my face and neck feels tighter. This product is very similar to other hyaluronic acid serums I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s a great product and I am very likely to order again.</li>
            <li> I was offered this product free no strings attached just to try !&lt;br /&gt;I am grateful I saw their special,  Have been using a week now and love it.&lt;br /&gt;I am very picky about products I use, this one is a keeper and I will be purchasing again and again !!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for giving me the opportunity to try.</li>
            <li> So good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Younger skin</li>
            <li> One of the best serums I have have used. It absorbs nicely into your skin without leaving a sticky or greasy layer. After using it for two weeks, I can really tell a difference. My skin is much softer and smoother than it was.</li>
            <li> These were delivered super fast. Love the facial serum. Feels so good on my face and I love the fragrance</li>
            <li> I love!!! Makes my skin feel so soft. I have been using about a week. I put it on at night and my skin feels great !!</li>
            <li> My skin is softer and brighter after using this product for two weeks. Also, my skin tone has also improved. I will continue to use this as part of my skin care regimen. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> I love this serum.  It has made my skin smoother and it has a glow.  I have received comments/questions on what have I done because my complexion is really youthful looking.  I just tell them, &amp;#34;Joy and Karma&amp;#34; serum.</li>
            <li> Keeps skin smooth and smells nice.</li>
            <li> I ordered the hyaluronic acid serum and vitamin C serum together and have been using them together. I&#x27;ve not had any reaction to them. They are nice sized bottles. It is premature to report any major difference in my complexion but I do feel that my face looks fresher and more flowing than before. I have always thought my complexion was a little ruddy looking b4. I will continue to update as I continue to use the product.</li>
            <li> Very good service and quility!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;So far I love your product, makes my skin very soft.&amp;#34;  I just started using this product, so hoping to see some of these wrinkle soften up over time also!</li>
            <li> Best Serum I have ever used!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am using this product for over 10 days and I have noticed visible improvement on expression lines, for a week I am using in combination with Joy &amp; Karma&#x27;s Vit C Serum and my skin feels firmer and my dark spots are less visible as well, I started using both serums separately, and within a week I started combining them, I am getting better results combining them both, this particular serum smells really nice and leaves your skin so soft, I love the fact that these products are organic, they certainly feel natural, I will most likely purchase again! Thank you Joy &amp; Karma!</li>
            <li> This is great!! Love the results</li>
            <li> Probably my favorite of the serums (and I&#x27;ve used many brands). I love the clear bottle and the Joy and Karma name. I&#x27;ve a fan of the what&#x27;s in the product in general but great packaging is always a nice plus.</li>
            <li> I really love this Serum, I can really see the difference in my skin after one use, Thanks</li>
            <li> This serum works great. It sinks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue. I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for about 6 weeks now and I definitely notice a difference in the moisture level and clarity of my skin. I also use the Joy and Karma Vitamin C serum and swap between the two. The vitamin C serum has a consistency that is close to water and the hyaluronic serum has the consistency of a light gel.</li>
            <li> I am 74 and have a few deep wrinkles.  This product seems to be smoothing them out.  I am new to using it but will continue to apply it in hopes of maintaining the good health of my skin and taking some of the &amp;#34;age lines&amp;#34; away.  So far, so good!</li>
            <li> Face looks clearer and smooth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have a problem with wrinkles, but I have been using the serum under moisturizer and it seems to be helping with my dry skin on my forehead which is great! Also, I have had no adverse reactions and I have very sensitive skin so this is very mild.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my face when I used this product. My face looked brighter and more alive and I noticed a diminishment in my acne scarring.</li>
            <li> I have used every wrinkle reduction product.  Have spent hundreds of dollars trying to find something that works.  This serum works so well that what ever wrinkles I had are gone.  I love this!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I should have taken a before and after picture to be able to say anything definitive about any anti aging effects, but I do feel my skin tighter after using the product, and I have been told I look great by people who haven&#x27;t seen me in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not conclusive since I&#x27;ve changed my hair color, length and style (which impacts the look of your skin drastically, as to get older your hair needs to be lighter or else the skin imperfections stand out) but I think I may be seeing some improvements in my eye lid puffiness. The upper lid was becoming droopy, causing me to have to change how I put my eye makeup on, but I think there&#x27;s been some tightening there.&lt;br /&gt;In order to give a definitive answer, I&#x27;d have to make no changes for a couple of weeks and take pictures. If I get around to that,I will be able to give a more accurate review. The product is good, it is easy to use and does have an effect you can feel. I just don&#x27;t tend to pay that much attention to my looks or keep a consistent regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturers are sincerely interested in your enjoyment of their product and are invested in your success with it, so nothing I&#x27;ve said is due to any lack of their care and communication. They do want people to be happy and care about any concerns they have. They seem like good people and I&#x27;d consider more of their products for that reason alone.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me. After I used regularly I didn&#x27;t see any difference. What a waste.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!  It erases  fine&lt;br /&gt;Lines &amp; wrinkles .  It also provides additional moisture.</li>
            <li> Love it! Feels so nice on my skin!  People have been complimenting me so much!</li>
            <li> This is definitely not the best I used. I was disappointed when I saw the ingredients label with a long list, plus it has a scent, which means that&#x27;s another ingredient I would not want in my Hyaluronic Acid. Thought this was more pure than it actually is.</li>
            <li> Very hydrating and moisturizing. My skin sucks it up as I apply it. Makes my skin feel nice and soft!</li>
            <li> used religiously, no improvement.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working well.</li>
            <li> Just started using this product but can&#x27;t wait to see the results!</li>
            <li> While a bit of a sceptic of facial products, believing more in the benefits of a healthy diet, ample hydration, exercise, gentle cleansing and a balance between sun and sun protection to keep skin youthful, after reading about the benefits of hyaluronic acid I decided to try it.  After 6 weeks of near-daily use I have to say that I am sold.  My skin looks and feels smoother, tighter and more radiant.  I will definitely continue buying this product as long as I keep getting these results.</li>
            <li> One of my new favorite serums</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!!</li>
            <li> Loving it, I already see my skin so beautiful , I&#x27;m in love. Lol and joy and karma sent me an email providing me with very useful info in how to use the serum so I&#x27;m very happy .</li>
            <li> I purchased this serum because of rave reviews, and because it is organic. I will say that it is ok, but I don&#x27;t find it so great. To be honest i don&#x27;t see any improvement in my skin and I already finished my bottle.  I have had used better.</li>
            <li> The real deal. Does just what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I love the way iit makes my skin feel and look. Love all the compliments I have been receiving. I will buy these products again</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Awesome products I will be purchasing this again :)</li>
            <li> love it! my skin has really responded to this product, it feels and looks better than it has in years!</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this serum. I have other brand, same serum that works as well as this one.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t tell the difference except for the price is higher for same stuff, same size.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything to my skin. I used the whole bottle and didn&#x27;t see any results. Also, I read that H-acid itself doesn&#x27;t do anything to your skin besides helping trap the moisture in your skin. Its molecules are simply too big to penetrate the skin. If &amp;#34;trapping moisture&amp;#34; all you&#x27;re going for then get it, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for the actual skin improvement/fine lines reduction.</li>
            <li> Great product, my skin looks rejuvenate. Will order again</li>
            <li> I use a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was smooth without stickiness .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also well absorbed . Satisfactory .</li>
            <li> I have been using this with my derma roller and it has only been two weeks and I have less noticeable acne scars on my legs. I&#x27;m so happy I finally made my purchase of this.</li>
            <li> Feels really smooth on my face and keeps it hydrated.  I have noticed since I started using it that my skin tone looks more even and definitely clearer.  Glad I decided to try this product out.</li>
            <li> I have only used the product for two days...so maybe more time would be more beneficial for a lengthier review. This product is a very lightweight serum, and leaves the skin with no residue, which feels great. I have applied it before bed for the past two nights and when I wake up, I feel like my skin is rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a week now, and I am seeing my skin change back to normal in front of my eyes each day! I will be posting a full video review in a few more weeks after using this!</li>
            <li> At first I am kinda scared to use this because of the name itself Acid... but i researched on YouTube on how to use it and I started to use it now I like the result on my face looks and feels smooth. I will definitely continue using this product,.</li>
            <li> Product is quite thin. I&#x27;ve not seen much improvement in my skin at all.</li>
            <li> Yes! This product is awesome!  But what&#x27;s is also awesome is this company&#x27;s 365-day money back guarantee!  SERIOUSLY! When you have a product of this quality/caliber, it&#x27;s no wonder they offer such a jaw-dropping guarantee!</li>
            <li> I really liked this serum!  I felt my skin had a glow the next day after using it.  It felt really hydrated.</li>
            <li> I like this serum so much better than their regular vitamin C serum because of the thickness of the formula. It is not as liquedy. However, I am following the recommendation from this company to use both at the same time. I&#x27;m hoping in time I will notice the benefits but so far I&#x27;m happy with this product</li>
            <li> I loved this product!</li>
            <li> Face looks great in the morning, plus I love the natural ingredients</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling soft and not greasy at all. It smells great too!</li>
            <li> Fast shipment-makes my skin feel soft and hydrated! Quick drying-I can feel it absorbing into my skin.</li>
            <li> I am loving this product ! It goes on so light and absorbs so well. I use a scrub in the shower in the morning and when I get out I put this all over my face and neck, following up with a lightweight moisturizer. I can see and feel a difference it the quality and appearance in my skin. I would recommend this  anyone wanting a product that works well and is not a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Great product. Exactly as described and expected.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a really nice difference in my skin. I will purchase more of this product!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this along with the Vitamin C serum and my skin feels great.  I use at night after cleansing and it soaks in my skin.  I feel like it is helping with overall texture of my skin.  Will continue to use!</li>
            <li> I am very skeptical about beauty/rejuvenating products. I am a 63 years woman and although the skin of my face has not deteriorated much I do have the spots and wrinkles that come with aging. I&#x27;ve been trying Best Hyaluronic for three weeks now and although there are no miracles there is a certain change on my skin all for the better, wrinkles and spots has lightened up and my skin looks much healthier. You just need to apply a couple of drops. It does not smell bad like other serums and it dissolves easily in the skin. I am a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I have not been using this product for very long, but I am already seeing the benefits. My pores are not as prominent and I am excited to see where this product takes me.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I think it helps reduce redness and dry skin patches.</li>
            <li> Works as well as high priced serums from high end department stores.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Hyaluronic Acid Serum for a few weeks now and I love how it is making my skin look.  First, it goes on very smoothly and easily and absorbs almost as fast as you put it on.  Second, my skin is now looking brighter - like some years have been taken off.  Whatever is going on, I am going to continue using it because I am loving it!</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot .  For the money it is a very good product.  The reason I gave three stars is because I already use an excellent product.</li>
            <li> You can feel this working after a few applications. I personally use it over the vit. C cream. It&#x27;s mild enough for me to use day. I&#x27;m loving how my skin feels. I&#x27;m noticing less patchy dry areas with this and the vit c serum and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working beautifully. I&#x27;ve been using it a few weeks now. The backs of my hands look so much smoother and plumper (I&#x27;m 51, and washing dishes by hand had really beaten up my skin). I&#x27;ll continue using on my hands, face, and neck!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using both the Hyaluronic serum and the vitamin C for about 2 weeks and I definitely see a difference. I&#x27;ve always had a mild case of acne (even at 57 years old) but since I&#x27;ve been using both products I&#x27;ve seen a huge improvement in my skin. Not only has the acne diminished but my skin looks more alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read both products can be used at the same time so after day 2 I decided to mix the 2 products together. Though I never read or inquired about doing so I just decided to do it. I use the mixture after I wash my face twice a day followed with a moisturizer of my choice, I haven&#x27; t seen any adverse problems with my skin since using these products. I&#x27;m only witnessing improvements</li>
            <li> this is working great so far and my skin looks wonderful after I use the product. I gave already ordered more!</li>
            <li> Just received a chemical peel and am using this product as one of my moisturizers.  So far I like it.</li>
            <li> Very well tolerated on my extremely sensitive skin. I applied to my face and gently patted it in. My skin responded by filling out small lines and wrinkles. Who doesn&#x27;t love that!</li>
            <li> 2 weeks in and I can&#x27;t say I have really noticed a difference. But easy to use and it feels nice.</li>
            <li> This serum is the best product I have ever put on my face. I have sensitive and acne prone skin. This did not cause any breakouts or rash and the ingredient list is absolutely phenomenal. I am so glad I was able to get this. I will most certainly be buying another bottle as soon as it becomes available again!!!!!!!! -Chelsea . ps their customer service is wonderful as well. I had something i needed to contact Joy and Karma about, and they responded right back via email and very friendly.</li>
            <li> This product is simply amazing. I have only used for a few days and already notice a difference. I have thinning skin under the eye &amp; can really notice that this product lifts &amp; really helps with fine line and wrinkles. If you are on the fence about trying this product look no further.</li>
            <li> Have not notice any difference.</li>
            <li> At 74 I presently am fortunate enough not to have wrinkles and I&#x27;m using your product as a maintenance to prevent wrinkles.  So I would not be a good person to review for improvement of wrinkles.  My husband ordered this but I (Nancy Moy his wife is using it) am using .</li>
            <li> I am loving this product!</li>
            <li> Nice serum but haven&#x27;t noticed results yet.</li>
            <li> I got this and the vitamin c serum from Joy and Karma as a special facebook coupon and I love them both! I mix two drops of each together morning and night as a serum under my moisturizer and after only two weeks my skin is looking better. If anyone wnts to know I am 55 and have health issues so my skin can really use the help. Buy these you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first, as with any new product, but I had to try it, atleast for the introductory price.  It took a few days before I saw any noticeable difference, but my face felt different (better) with the first application.  Can&#x27;t wait to see results after using the entire bottle!  I hope they will keep their price competitive.</li>
            <li> Love it one of the best serum at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I love this product and week two seen a big difference in my skin. I love how this product feels going on and my face feels much softer and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Love it! and for the firsr time in many years, no long make up cover up!&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I love this HA serum. Nice texture, good ingredients and i can see some results already. Looking forward for more improvement as i continue to use a product. I am glad i tried your brand of serum!</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s OK nothing really to report. I think it&#x27;s too soon to say good or bad so I gave it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Very good serum! Does&#x27;nt pill under makeup, and seems to already be improving the dull appearance of my skin! Love it!</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh I have just found the best thing for my face. As soon as I got it I tried it. I have had it for over a week and I just love it . it has taken my heart surgery scar almost gone. And the little wrinkles around my mouth are starting to disappear. I love it. Thanks for letting me try this.</li>
            <li> Works okay but I found the Hyaluronic and the Vitamin C Serum from this company a little thin as I had to use twice as much as another brand and I didn&#x27;t have to use 2 products to do the job of one. Probably won&#x27;t reorder these.</li>
            <li> this is very good absorbs quickly finding out very pleasant to use.</li>
            <li> great products and I received them faster than expected</li>
            <li> Love it!!  Makes my skin feel great,  reduction already in fine lines and wrinkles, makes my skin feel well hydrated.  I cannot wait to see the results from longer use!!</li>
            <li> I received my order and started using it and I love it.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff!!! Keep making it!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful product! It works beautifully when I mixed a little with the soy moisturizer I have. I noticed a huge improvement in my skin in only two weeks....much smoother, better skin tone and those little crows feet I have are almost invisible! Being a nutritionist myself, I&#x27;ve spent a small fortune on several organic and natural products with little to moderate results, but this is so affordable and a product I will definitely continue to use on a regular basis. Thank you so very much for a great product, Joy and Karma! Highly recommended! :)</li>
            <li> Love this need to order more! Great in combination with derma roller</li>
            <li> effective skin product</li>
            <li> I have used this product together with the C serum faithfully since June. I bought the products as I read so many good review, but it has not made any difference to my skin. I want my refund.</li>
            <li> I have used several different Serum&#x27;s and have been in the market for a new one since the one I have previously used is not available anymore. This one is just &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; IMO. I am comparing it to the one that I absolutely loved so I may be biased. I&#x27;m glad I did not pay full price for this serum or else I would be upset. Thank you for opportunity to try it.</li>
            <li> Love this. Makes my skin feel tighter and hope it will help with fine lines on my face. Will be buying another soon.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for about 4 weeks now but only in the mornings.&lt;br /&gt;My face is smoother, my skin is not dry and the fine lines are not so noticeable,&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is about half full so it last pretty long. Over the years, I have tried many anti-aging products, this is one of the best.  I would recommend this product because it works.</li>
            <li> Very nice.. quick delivery, so satisfied</li>
            <li> makes my skin feel great!</li>
            <li> Is very useful in skin</li>
            <li> I love this!!! My skin feels so amazing. It&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This product works like it should.  I like the packaging it came in as well.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! The hyaluronic acid and vitamin C together in a serum feels awesome as I spread it on my face every night. Layer a heavy moisturizer over it, and it gives me the best skin I&#x27;ve had in MANY years! No mid-life pimples, smaller pores- it&#x27;s all good!  I recommend this to anyone who wants to improve their skin texture at any stage of life.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of my skin after using this serum! I have used some in the past that make my face feel really sticky and so I end up taking it off. This serum dries smooth. My skin feels so refreshed. I have noticed some tightening of my skin so I am sure after continued use my skin is going to become firmer. I use this along with the Best Vitamin C Serum with Hyaluronic Acid also by Joy and Karma. They work very well together!</li>
            <li> Master Review For Both Vitamin C Serum, and Hyaluronic Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Overviews: The products both work with initial contact. They both smooth your skin, and give you a slight natural glow. The Hya. Serum is very thick and slightly sticky, but nice. It is easy to spread, and will last a long time. You only need a drop or two. The Vitamin C serum, however, is very watery and not very spreadable, and I found myself having to use a lot. It will probably run out 3x as fast as the Hya. Serum. They did not irritate my skin at all, and had a nice light scent. I will update this review in the future, with further details of long term usage on skin, for both me, 18yrs old, and my mother, 50yrs old, to report on the effects for both young and old skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging: The packaging was good. A flip up cardboard box, which encased the two bottles wrapped in a light amount of bubble wrap. I think the bottles would be much safer in their own boxes though, because they easily could have been damaged during the handling process if it was handled by a clumsy postman. Each also came with a 25% off coupon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer Service: The customer service for this company is A+. I annoyed them purposely. I emailed them at least three times in the week they were shipping, just asking how to order, why the shipping wasn&#x27;t working, why my package was in a town for so long, etc. But they always responded within 24 hours of my inquiry, and were polite and thorough in helping me out, and making sure I was satisfied. This was very comforting. There are many companies who simply ignore customers who ask a lot of questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros Of Hya Serum:&lt;br /&gt;Thick&lt;br /&gt;Only need a little&lt;br /&gt;Pleasant smell&lt;br /&gt;Hydrates skin&lt;br /&gt;Makes your skin look smooth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons Of Hya Serum:&lt;br /&gt;Sticky&lt;br /&gt;When it dries, you kinda get that feeling like when a face mask dries on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros Of Vitamin C Serum:&lt;br /&gt;Hydrates Skin&lt;br /&gt;Makes your skin look smooth&lt;br /&gt;Pleasant smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons Of Vitamin C Serum&lt;br /&gt;Thin and watery&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t spread at all on skin&lt;br /&gt;Need to use a vast amount to cover face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;((TO BE UPDATED AT A FUTURE DATE AFTER PROLONGED USE))/&gt;Pleasant smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons Of Vitamin C Serum&lt;br /&gt;Thin and watery&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t spread at all on skin&lt;br /&gt;Need to use a vast amount to cover face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;((TO BE UPDATED AT A FUTURE DATE AFTER PROLONGED USE))</li>
            <li> A bit too oily. Would be good for someone with dryer skin. I use sparingly.</li>
            <li> Love these facial moisturizers.  I&#x27;ve really seen a difference in my skin!</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this serum, it goes on smooth and it makes my makeup look professional</li>
            <li> This Serum is amazing....Love it!!</li>
            <li> Friend excited to use it. Gave as gift. Looks high quality.</li>
            <li> I have been using both the Vitamin C Serum followed by the Hyaluronic Acid Serum for about two weeks now and love the combination.  I have used similar more expensive products and the result from the JK brand are just as good, if not better.  I will definitely be ordering both again.</li>
            <li> Love this serum! I have very sensitive skin and have issues with many beauty products, not this one. It leaves my face feeling fresh and soft.</li>
            <li> Really liking this product first and foremost because they do not test on animals! That is a huge decision go or no go for me. I noticed right away a smoothness to my skin and a tighting in the neck area. Highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a moisturizer that helps smooth and tighten!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to make an informed decision about any long-term benefits; but so far I can say that I like the feel of the product and I haven&#x27;t had any adverse effects.</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great product! Seems to be improving the action of the products I currently use. Great price too!</li>
            <li> Very good. I like it!</li>
            <li> Love love love the Joy &amp; Karma products! I have several of their oils.</li>
            <li> Love this serum! Light, smooth and not greasy! Feels great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for two weeks, but it smooths my skin and hopefully is helping it to resist the environmental stress of sun and pollutants.  Believe it&#x27;s a good product!</li>
            <li> This is the BEST product of it&#x27;s kind. It just goes to show that their is truth in advertising.</li>
            <li> I read an article in the Dermatology Review about Hyaluronic Acid. It is a substance naturally found in the body to cushion joints as well as hydrate the skin. Not only does it help skin retain moisture, but it helps to plump out the skin, minimizing the look of fine lines and wrinkles. And who wouldn&#x27;t love that idea? I use mine with the Vitamin C serum to protect my skin from the elements and to minimize signs of aging (after all, just because I am getting older doesn&#x27;t mean I have to look like it, right?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is easy to apply and a little goes a long way. And it&#x27;s 98% natural, which can only be a good thing.</li>
            <li> Smooths out the skin on my face and works really good with my moisturizer. Love that it doesn&#x27;t have a scent, way to many products nowadays smell too strong.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product and the Vitamin C serum, one on each side of my face. Then I got Bronchitis, so I&#x27;ve only actually applied the products 3 times. The excema like rash in my t-zone is almost completely gone. I have been fighting that for years. Kudos Joy and Karma on two great products. The only difference I have noted so far is that the Vitamin C side has a more powdery skin feel.</li>
            <li> Move over beauty products!! There is a new hero in town! Hyaluronic Acid Serum has to be one of the best products out there!! I&#x27;m 55 and a former sun worshiper, tanning bed queen. My skin has taken a lot of abuse. I truly see a difference using Joy and Karma&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum along with the Vitamin C serum. The Hyaluronic Acid Serum is thick. From the eye dropper I put the serum on the back of my hand and then pat into my face. This serum doesn&#x27;t sting! Even with the word acid in the title! No sting! EVEN my HANDS look younger!! My face and neck are both smoother, softer, FIRMER and hydrated. My skin feels firmer without feeling like it&#x27;s being stretched!!  While the serum is moisturizing it&#x27;s NOT sticky and doesn&#x27;t leave my face greasy, I just have a wonderful healthy glow to my skin. There is no fragrance to the serum.&lt;br /&gt;This should be in every girls arsenal for healthy, smooth, firmer, skin!! LOVE THIS STUFF!!!</li>
            <li> I love this products. I have used them everyday since receiving them. My skin is not only softer and smoother, my hands are too; I even had a compliment on how soft they were!!! I had no irritation either. I am looking forward to trying new products soon!!! You only have to use a small amount to achieve the desired effect.</li>
            <li> loved the product--my skin feels and looks so much better! Been using it for over a month, a little bit goes a long way --have sensitive skin and have had no issues at all. great service and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I paired this with Joy and Karma&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum and use it nightly with an organic night cream. Since using the products, I have noticed a brighter and smoother skin tone, smaller pores, diminished wrinkles around my eyes, and a pleasantly unexpected result...my &amp;#34;monthly&amp;#34; chin acne was barely noticeable the first month of use and almost non existent the second month. I also use the Vitamin C Serum in the morning with my CC cream. Both products are easy to use and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have been using this along with the Vitamin C serum and I love it! I use it every night before bed, and my skin is softer and healthier looking! I have a better complexion. I would recommend this product if you would like to have a new GLOW about you face!</li>
            <li> I tried this for a couple of weeks and loved the way it went on my skin. With others products you are informed that you should use a moisturizer after the serum has been completely absorbed, which is okay but I&#x27;ve noticed that although I&#x27;ve done exactly that with this serum, I did forget a couple of times and didn&#x27;t bother using anything other than the product. It is non greasy and leaves my skin feeling soft. I&#x27;ve noticed the suppleness and even my husband has noticed.  So I guess you can use it with or without an added moisturizer. It still works great. I usually only put It on at night because I have a lot of work to do during the day in  my yard and garden and find that sweating brings out the oils in my skin so I&#x27;m constantly wiping it off. After a hot shower and good facial cleansing, I put this on at night love the way my skin feels afterwards.</li>
            <li> I started using is product about 2 weeks ago and can tell a difference in my skin already...my neck does NOT look like crepe paper any more!&lt;br /&gt;My face is full and smooth when I wake up and not sunken in anymore. I used to look really scary in the morning. :-( now I look like me! :-)&lt;br /&gt;I told my sister and she bought both products from Joy and Karma! And we love the purity of the serum too.</li>
            <li> Very light serum with a soft scent. I feel it absorb immediately with no sticky residue.  I only have used it for a week and feel that my skin is softer.&lt;br /&gt;~Amy</li>
            <li> I have used this for a few weeks now and i have noticed that it has really moisturized my face and has made it seem smoother.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to use this with the vitamin C serum to get a better smoother appearance.</li>
            <li> As I use this serum, My skin felt moisture.&lt;br /&gt;This serum was made of spoid and It is useful.&lt;br /&gt;And it is amount eough.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this serum.</li>
            <li> This stuff has caused miracles to happen!! I am a type 1 diabetic who has had some sort of acne all of my life i have NEVER been able to find something powerful enough to keep my face hydrated UNTIL NOW!! I have used EVERYTHING on the market + been to a dermatologist all of my life, and when i say I have used EVERYTHING i mean EVERYTHING. All i had to do was find something that was mostly natural and/or organic, I can&#x27;t believe i NEVER thought of that!!! I have never in my life been able to have a clear, hydrated, and healthy looking face until now, and when i started this 2 weeks ago my face was completely dry and flaky and i had several hormone related acne spots, after ordering DHEA 50mg along with the Best Hyaluronic Acid Serum + the Vitamin C serum by Joy and Karma. My face finally looks BEAUTIFUL, and what&#x27;s funny is the dryness went away after my first use. I will swear by this stuff until the day i die!! Joy and Karma has now changed my life to the fullest and I&#x27;m so excited to be able to go show my new face off!!</li>
            <li> Very happy with my results so far. For someone that has oily / sensitive skin, there have been zero problems (and I probably used way more than I should!) also, great customer support and timely response to a question that I sent! Will gladly look to Joy and Karma in the future</li>
            <li> love it! my skin looks great</li>
            <li> great product, thank you</li>
            <li> Love the way my face feels &amp; looks!</li>
            <li> LOVE.THIS.SERUM.  I use Hyaluronic Acid everyday and it is like a facelift in a bottle.  If you&#x27;re young start using this product to stay looking young and if you are older start using this product for younger youthful looking skin.  It has helped my skin stay clear and after it dries it almost makes your skin feel a little tight, like you really can tell it&#x27;s helping your skin.  It is amazing and it&#x27;s so affordable, I wish I had discovered sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had previously been using a different brand of Hyaluronic Acid serum but the Joy and Karma brand does not only cost less but it has all the same ingredients and it&#x27;s Made In The USA!  If you want your skin to be the best it can be, definitely try this serum you will be glad you did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made &amp; Sold by: Joy and Karma&lt;br /&gt;Shipped by: Amazon LLC&lt;br /&gt;Delivered: 7 days after order date</li>
            <li> good quality!! exceeds my expectations!!</li>
            <li> Impressive product.  J and K sent extra tips ...really appreciated.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful Hyaluronic Acid Serum. It feels wonderful on and works wonderfully with my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Excellent service. Great product. I am very pleased with my purchase. I&#x27;ve noticed improvements with my skin shortly after using. I have sensitive skin and I haven&#x27;t had any problem using this product. My skin looks and feels healthier. &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love how this makes my face feel</li>
            <li> i will be switching the 2 day to day. everybody has a different view of what little means when it comes to the amount of something so you might want to say pea size or something but very smooth</li>
            <li> This serum is absolutely fabulous! It is a thicker serum, and when it arrived I was afraid it would be heavy on my oily skin; however it is not. It is a silky formulation, and your skin just drinks it up! It has none of those nasty chemical smells that many serums have; it is very pleasant! I have only been using it a few days, and I can already see a change in my skin! My skin is smoother and softer, and the dullness is going away. It looks brighter, and more alive! This comes in a generous 1 oz bottle, and a little goes a long way! I was also very pleased at the packaging; it was securely fastened inside a bubble wrap bag...it even came with a code for 25% off the next purchase...TY! If you are on the fence about this serum, I would say give it a try! I am in love with this serum...it is a WINNER...TY Joy and Karma!  TY, Robyne Butts</li>
            <li> great serum from the first time i used it i noticed instant moisture not greasy at all absorbs quikley highly recomend</li>
            <li> I was very surprised by this product - it was very thick, unlike other serums I&#x27;ve tried. It is unscented and leaves my skin feeling refreshed, soft and smoother. You can feel the difference in your skin!</li>
            <li> I think I like it pretty good.  I need more time to use it.  so far no major result but I think over time it will work.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I use it primarily in the morning after washing my face and before putting on my tinted sunscreen - Clinique&#x27;s City Block.  Sometimes a light dusting of BareMinerals over that.  But that is it.  This product is light and it provides the light moisturizing I want under makeup.  I read criticisms of it that it was too watery.  I think the (watery) Aloe Vera base is just perfect, personally.</li>
            <li> IM 43 YR OLD BLACK WOMAN &amp; I WAS LOOKING FOR A PRODUCT TO JUST EVEN OUT MY SKIN TONE. NO WRINKLES YET BUT I HAVE ACNE SCARS THAT ARE DARK AND IVE TRIED SO MANY PRODUCTS THAT DIDNT WORK.SO I PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT TO SEE IF IT  WOULD DO SOMETHING FOR MY SKIN. I HAVE OILY SKIN SO I DIDN&#x27;T NEED TO USE THIS IN CONJUNCTION WITH A MOISTURIZER AS A LOT OF THE OTHER POSTS STATED. I WASH MY FACE BEFORE BED WITH JOHNSON AND JOHNSON PURPOSE SOAP THEN I USE A DROP OF THE HYALURONIC ACID SERUM ON MY FOREHEAD A DROP ON BOTH CHEEKS AND A DROP ON MY CHIN AN RUB IT ALL IN EVEN ON MY NECK. IVE BEEN USING THIS FOR 5 DAYS NOW AND THERE&#x27;S A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN MY SKIN TONE. MY ACNE SCARS HAVE LIGHTENED UP TREMENDOUSLY. MY CO-WORKERS ARE ASKING WHAT AM I USING ON MY SKIN. I DONT WEAR MAKE UP DAILY. I ONLY WEAR IT WHEN IM GOING SOMEWHERE SPECIAL. SO TO STILL HAVE ACNE AND ACNE SCARRING AT 43 KINDA PERPLEXED ME. SiNCE THIS PRODUCT I HAVEN&#x27;T HAD ANY NEW ACNE AND THE SCARRING IS MUCH LIGHTER IN JUST 5 DAYS. TRY IT FOR YOURSELF.  I LOVE IT!  IT WORKED FOR ME! IM GETTING READY TO PURCHASE THE VITAMIN C SERUM NEXT AND USE THEM TOGETHER..</li>
            <li> Althou face is softer no difference after full 45 days with lines or wrinkles</li>
            <li> Great product that really does what it is supposed to do !</li>
            <li> I have noticed that after using Hyaluronic Acid Serum my skin is much more radiant and I have to use much less foundation. It has less redness and it also feels softer. i look in the mirror and see that the fimne lines also look much less moticeable. It smells great and it makes my whole face look better.</li>
            <li> Excellent product !!!</li>
            <li> Nice product,goes on quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Totally recommend! I have been using it for a week and I do see the difference!! Good product</li>
            <li> this hyaluronic acid serum from joy and karma is great it so wonderful I love this it works in about 3 days you look more glowing more vibrant I wil buy this all the time now</li>
            <li> Have definitely noticed improvement in my facial skin and neckline. Although I wouldn&#x27;t recommend wearing under your makeup; this is best used before bedtime</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks now. My skin feels firmer and smooth. I have sensitive skin and there was no irritation which is great! I will definitely recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> there has been no change in my skin in the 3 weeks that I&#x27;ve used this product.</li>
            <li> Works really well. I have definitely noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> The reason I am giving 4 stars to this product is because it does not agree with my skin. Every time I use it, my T-zone looks shiny after a while, and my pores appear enlarged. Now, I am not saying it is the product, but my skin type. I have no doubt that the product is great, mostly because of all the organic ingredients. I wished it would have agreed with my skin, but unfortunately it did not work for me. Having said that, I would definitely recommend it for those with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Ive been useing this serum for about a 3 weeks now and results are showing up. My face looks shiny and vibrant. I would reccomend this product to anyone that is looking to look young again without the need of plastic surgery or needles.</li>
            <li> This is a good product. Although I did&#x27;t / haven&#x27;t begun to use it consistently yet.&lt;br /&gt;The few times that  I have used it, it appears to really refresh and moisturize my skin.</li>
            <li> I really love this product and I&#x27;m all about natural. I&#x27;m also aging early because of (stress) a lot of hydrocortisone use through the years for my eczema and this HELPS!!! Tightens, seems to be building strength in the skin which many products promise and few deliver on.. I probably won&#x27;t go without this product again if I can help it. The vitamin C serum is nice as well and I use it about half as much as this.. Usually in the am whereas I use this after each face wash before moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Fast shipping, great product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for over a week and so far I love it. It leaves me with softer smoother looking skin and doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate my skin like other products do since I have senstive skin.</li>
            <li> I have fair complexion and some trouble with rosacia on my cheeks, nose, and forehead. Since I started using this serum a few weeks, there has been a VERY noticeable change in the level of redness on my face. I was happily surprised when my coworkers said yesterday that I look brighter. I put on about three drops each night followed by a moisturizer. A little really does go a long way. The product is light, gives great coverage, and sinks into the skin quickly without leaving a sticky or tacky residue. When I wake up in the morning, my skin is smooth, even, and supple. I&#x27;ve even been using less makeup. Two thumbs up for Joy and Karma - a great debut!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for three days. I could see a difference in just one day. My skin has a much more even tone and the dryness is gone! Love It!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel refreshed. I have recommended this to&lt;br /&gt;family and friends. Great Product to have. Love the organic and&lt;br /&gt;natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month, along with their vitamin C serum and so far i&#x27;m loving them!  I love being outdoors and in the sunshine and these products have keep my face from getting dry and that old leather look that some people get in the summertime from tanned skin.  I have extremely sensitive eyes and this has not irritated them at all!!!  I feel that is has helped give my skin a nice, even smooth appearance!!</li>
            <li> Love it! I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks and saw an immediate difference in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to try this because my face is very sensitive and dry. However I have been using this product since the day I got it. My skin has a certain glow and is no longer dry and flaky. I use the Hyaluronic Acid serum facial moisturizer, I took part of the promotional sale to try the products and I am a life long customer. I recommend this to anyone who has sensitive and dry combination skin. I do have to use this every other day or my face breaks out. I am happy with the way my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product a few weeks, but so far I&#x27;m loving how much tighter my skin feels which has decreased my smiles lines. Love it do far. Using it along with the vitamin C serum on my face and neck. I only use it once a day.</li>
            <li> I have used two bottle of this serum now and although I initially liked it and therefore purchased more, I&#x27;ve come to have some reservations.  First, its gel consistency is nice.  I wore it under an oil free moisturizer as a boost.  I have oily skin and anything that&#x27;s greasy or oily at all really does a number on my skin and makeup.  This gel dries quickly.  But secondly, I&#x27;ve seen no improvement in my skin at all.  It&#x27;s not plumper and my one tiny age spot hasn&#x27;t faded even a little bit.  Each bottle lasts me approximately a month, using it once a day in the morning.  I would have expected some minimal positive outcome in 8 weeks, but there&#x27;s been no visible improvement.  During this time, I had no negative skin reaction to the gel at all.  However, I used a retinol product on my skin at night for a week and thereafter, I couldn&#x27;t use the Joy and Karma product at all.  My skin simply became super sensitive overnight.  I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in it, but whatever it is, it played havoc with my skin.  I have since stopped using it.  I have approximately a third of a bottle left and I will try again after 6 months of laying low.  I don&#x27;t think the gel has any fragrance in it, at least none that I can detect.  I also don&#x27;t think it contains any hydroxy acids or anything that could be considered along those lines.  Hylauronic acid is simply a moisturizing ingredient, not one that sloughs off skin cells, so I&#x27;m at a loss at to why my skin reacted as it did.  Before the retinol, everything was fine.  I&#x27;m giving this three stars because I didn&#x27;t see any positive results in the two months I used it.  I&#x27;m not taking away any stars because of my negative reaction because I truly don&#x27;t believe the Joy and Karma gel had anything to do with it.  However, if you have very sensitive skin, you may want to steer clear of this product.</li>
            <li> I just love using this hyaluronic acid it just makes my face look younger and feel good it gives it a smooth feeling over your face  leaving it hydrated</li>
            <li> This product arrived in good time. Application is easy, however, it does take me a while to work it in my skin (which is the only issue, I really have with it). It has a gel like texture. I have dry skin.  I did not have any bad reactions to it. Left my skin feeling tightened and fresh. I apply it after I cleanse my face, and before I moisturize.</li>
            <li> Wow! I found this product through a Facebook promo, I figured I had nothing to lose and gave it a try. I am so happy I did. I normally use a vitamin c serum that costs about twice the price, I&#x27;ve been using the Joy &amp; Karma vitamin c serum along with the Joy &amp; Karma hyaluronic serum for just over a week now and love the results. My skin feels smooth and silky. These Joy &amp; Karma products will replace two more expensive - chemical products for me. I love that they are natural and mostly organic.</li>
            <li> Upon first using this, I already noticed a difference in my skin&#x27;s texture. Love it! Gradually working up to using the vitamin c serum in conjunction.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for a few weeks, and have noticed a big difference in my skin. It&#x27;s hard to find products that don&#x27;t irritate my skin, but this serum works really well, and the results are great!</li>
            <li> Just like the title says. I use it every day mixed in with my makeup. My skin looks and feels great!</li>
            <li> After using this for a couple of weeks and following the tips given by Joy and Karma via e-mail...I love it.  Makes my skin look fresh and alive.  Seems to be taking care of some of the fine lines in my face too.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this serum!  When I use it underneath my moisturizer it makes my skin feel plump and moist.  I really can tell over the last 4-6 weeks that some of my fine lines and wrinkles have filled in.  It takes a while to see a difference, but give it a chance!!</li>
            <li> I am in like with the Hyaluronic Serum - Almost to Love - I&#x27;m about half of the way through the bottle &amp; am starting to see results.  I knew it would not happen over night.  So I do watch (inspect)  every morning and I am starting to see what I had hoped would happen - the lines &amp; wrinkles are getting finer - --Wish I would have taken pictures.  Hope I get the $2.00 bottle tomorrow so I can continue the process.  Very pleased</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! It left me glowing the next morning!  Other then that I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see other effects.</li>
            <li> I love this serum together with the Vitamin C serum from same company. I have fair skin but it&#x27;s dull and unhealthy looking. After using this product I love how my skin glows. It&#x27;s smooth and very soft. I love this product!</li>
            <li> My package was delayed by one day because of a UPS error. I tried the Joy &amp; Karma serum and it&#x27;s fantastic!! My skin felt so smooth and soft. Ladies, this one is a keeper</li>
            <li> Very good product!  It leaves the skin very hydrated. I would definitely repurchase! The customer service at Joy and Karma is great too!</li>
            <li> As a card carrying member of the &amp;#34;Real Housewives of Anywhere that Cannot Afford Botox, implants, or Facelifts&amp;#34;, I have to say that Joy and Karma Hyaluronic Serum with Vitamin C is the best kept secret around! But, rest assured, it will NOT stay so.You will be receiving copious orders from my friends, family, and complete strangers. After 8 yeas of dibillitating illness and therapy, my 50-something face looked like a flock of crows had walk all over it, and my jowls would have put any bassett hound to shame. After just one (ONE) application, I was literally dancing around my vanity! After a week, I felt like asking my husband to take me to a prom...well, you get my drift. Self confidence and esteeme is a wonderful thing. Thank you Joy and Karma for giving me back both! Having once been a singer I say,&amp;#34; Oh joy, oh rapture!&amp;#34; Lol</li>
            <li> I have used this several days and love it. It goes on smooth, and now my skin looks very smooth and nice. Joy and Karma have written me serval times before this product arrived  and explained procedures on application.this made me very comfortable to use this product. It was a great deal for great product. Thanks I have now used this product a few weeks now. It is great my skin feels so soft and clean. I recommend this product to anyone I got a great deal to try this product. Trust me I will buy again even without special.</li>
            <li> The word &amp;#34;acid&amp;#34; freaks everyone out,  but if you know what it does,  you will love this! It doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue on your face. I do use this only at night.  I have noticed the area&#x27;s that need moisture,  are looking better!</li>
            <li> I love this product!! I am also sharing with my daughter and she loves it, too!!</li>
            <li> I loved using this product on my face! I used it twice a day for a month and my face felt smoother and looked better overall. I think it does what it says it will do and doesn&#x27;t feel tacky or sticky on I barely noticed that I had it on under makeup. Great product!</li>
            <li> Great product! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this !  Noticed improvement on my sensitive and mature skin on the second day.  Excellent Product !</li>
            <li> Thank you for giving good products.</li>
            <li> I received my Joy and Karma Hyaluronic Serum a couple of days ago .  I love the way it feels on my skin .  I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after a week or so .</li>
            <li> So far I like it. Hasn&#x27;t been very long that I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels so much better!  I have been recommending it to all of my friends and family!</li>
            <li> I have used many skin care products and I think this is wonderful!  Facing 60 this year and really seeing a change in my skin so I tried this product and it&#x27;s truly wonderful!  Twice a day before moisturized and my skin looks plumper and fresh!  I will continue using this and recommend this product !  Love that it&#x27;s called Joy and Karma too.......that along makes it worth using &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I really like the way this product made my face and neck feel! So soft to the touch!</li>
            <li> I like the JK Vit C serum better. I feel the C serum delivers better result. This is gel-like so it just sits on the skin. I&#x27;d continue to use and hopefully results would start to show. Received free for honest feedback.</li>
            <li> It was not a good product for me.  Made my skin red and was not happy with it</li>
            <li> In my opinion this should be one of the staples in everyone skincare routine.  This serum not only plumps and moisturizes skin, it also helps heal and comfort skin. Hyaluronic Acid will also prevent fine lines and wrinkles. Great product!</li>
            <li> I am noticing a subtle difference in my skin after using this for about two weeks, both morning and evening.  It seems to be diminishing my pores somewhat and my skin does not feel as dry or flaky.</li>
            <li> This product has given my skin a clear, clean, smooth look. And my face appears plumper and has a glow to it. Nothing is going to turn back time but this product has given me a definite lift in spirit and lit up my face. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Have been using for about 2 wks now and I have started to see a reduction in my age spots. My skin is smooth and glowing. This is a keeper!</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve started using Joy and karma&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Facial Moisturizer my skin is not only looking better its softer feeling.  I was sent a bottle to try and once I used that up I had to order another, my skin soaks this up.  Not only is my skin feeling softer it seems to be a little firmer.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months.</li>
            <li> 5 Stars&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;fantastic product - msm - and other ingredients are excellent for the skin - for encouraging collagen and moisturizing with creating black heads etc. love love love the product</li>
            <li> Love the way this makes my old skin look!</li>
            <li> i still feel like I need more time with it, but I honestly started having people tell me I look like I lost weight in my face within a week of using it.  Looking forward to continuing to use it and seeing more results.</li>
            <li> Really love this product. I have been using this for about 2 weeks or so.. I dont have any wrinkles so i couldnt verify it works for that, however, i Have some little dark spots on my face and i can see they are lighting up. My skin is softer. I do recommend this product and i will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> I just received the product, only using it a few times.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any results in this short time, as yet. I appreciate the quick delivery and do like the consistency of the product.  I REALLY SEE A DIFFRENCE!   Wonderful product, thank you!</li>
            <li> This disappears into your skin and feels great! It is even helping my excema!</li>
            <li> It seems to be making some difference.</li>
            <li> Fabulous facial serum! Being 62 years young my skin is showing signs of maturing. In less than 2 weeks time my fine lines and wrinkles are diminishing. Thank you Joy &amp; Karma! It goes on smooth and absorbs quickly. Love everything stated in description of this truly amazing product!</li>
            <li> My face feels smoother but I don&#x27;t see any noticeable difference. Could be too soon.</li>
            <li> Have been using the serum on a skin condition with very good results after only 4 days. Thank you!</li>
            <li> So far I see no Difference.</li>
            <li> I have seen a difference in the look of my fine lines and wrinkles, (Deep cracks and Crevices) since using the Best Hyaluranic Acid Serum Facial Moisturizer. I have been mistaken for a much younger version of myself on several occasions during this journey. I would recommend this product to anyone wanting to manage those pesky aging requirements for our skin. You can look several years younger with faithful application of this awesome product. We are only as old as we feel until we look in a mirror, do yourself a favor start using Best Hualuranic Acid Serum Facial Moisturizer today!</li>
            <li> Feels so good on the skin, and I have noticed a difference since beginning its use. I will continue to use this! Back for more!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. So far I&#x27;m in love wuthering the way it feels and can already notice a difference.</li>
            <li> very good!!&lt;br /&gt;Skin became moist</li>
            <li> I love this serum it is absolutely fabulous!</li>
            <li> I have been extremely please with the results of this product.  My crow&#x27;s feet and other lines appear to be much less noticeable.  I will certainly continue to use and will recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> It was okay but I wish the serum was more gooey. Not sure if I like the texture as I wanted it to be not like water. It certainly came out of the bottle a bit thicker. I am not sure if it made my skin look any better -- it didn&#x27;t make it worse. With the really harsh winter weather in New York City, I may need a more emollient serum.</li>
            <li> Never used before and after a few weeks,  my skin looks clearer and healthier with a more even tone. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> This is good. Sure  makes my facial skin look good. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Still waiting to see results....staying hopeful</li>
            <li> Love this serum that provides so much moisture to the trouble spots around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Love it! This is so hydrating and really brightens my face. I&#x27;m addicted, I have been using these serums in place of branded serums that are much more expensive. Another great aspect is that this serum is made of a large percentage of natural and organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> Works great. My face feels younger and looks better. I noticed the difference right away. .</li>
            <li> I really love what this is doing for my skin.  Being 40 something, everyone thinks I&#x27;m in my 30s!</li>
            <li> I am loving this serum easy to use</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I see a difference in my skin in only a few days! #</li>
            <li> i have to say i was impressed with this serum- felt and saw a difference- i normally use image hyaluronic serum and that is a higher % but is more expensive- overall good stuff i would order again</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for 2 weeks and have noticed my skins appearance is alot smoother.  I will continue to use and look for more beneficial results.</li>
            <li> I bought a second time...along with the vitamin C and use both...let dry then i moisturize my face.  My face is so smooth I have had girlfriends compliment me!</li>
            <li> I have recently started using this product and see a difference.  I have sensitive, dry mature skin.  This is a lovely product and I have seen the difference in my skin after just a few days usage.</li>
            <li> Nothing on the box says this is a moisturizer, in fact it says to use your favorite moisturizer after applying this product.  Rather disappointed in that I wanted a moisturizer!</li>
            <li> A really good moisturizer. Its not the regular moisturizer, because its not liquid. Makes my face more soft and it feels really good.</li>
            <li> I started to use the Hyaluronic acid that evening and used 2 x day. After 2 weeks I really could not see much difference. I continued to use 2 x day but at this point I really cannot see much difference. I used this acid first after cleansing then moisturize. Again at this point I can not see much difference.</li>
            <li> I absolutely Love this Serum! It absorbs very quickly and does not leave my face feeling greasy or sticky. I am only 25 but I feel like it&#x27;s never too early to start using anti-aging products. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a good hyaluronic acid serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I really really loved this stuff. After using it for a couple months, I ended up using every single last drop. I actually noticed a difference in my skin after just a few days! It even seemed to make my makeup go on a lot nicer. My face feels so much healthier and looks a lot nicer since I started using it. I&#x27;m VERY pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product received for testing and review. All thoughts and opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> This is amazing stuff! I don&#x27;t know if its just my unique experience but, my skin felt different the very next morning after the first use. I use it everyday....in the morning with my vitamin C serum and I alternate night use with my retinol.  This addition to my skin regimen is definitely making a difference. People actually remark that I look so much younger than I am....or maybe because I&#x27;m in love now or maybe its a combination of both ;)...anyways, this stuff is awesome and the price is hard to beat. This has a permanent place in my medicine cabinet.....</li>
            <li> seems to only work on very fine lines, skin feels oily instead of moisterized</li>
            <li> This IS the best HYROLONIC ACID I have used to date and I have tried many other brands on the market today.  As suggested I used it along with Vitamin C Serum, and it is working beautifully.  Thank you JOY AND KARMA for bringing this product to Amazon and for suggesting it on Facebook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My best to you,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frances Thibadeau Smith&lt;br /&gt;fransmith2005@yahoo.com</li>
