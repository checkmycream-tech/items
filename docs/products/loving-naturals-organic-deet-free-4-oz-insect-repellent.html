            <li>The good</li>
            <li>: This stuff has worked surprisingly well at keeping mosquitoes from biting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a horrible smell, but I guess I don&#x27;t find it as pleasant as some reviewers did.  </li>
            <li>I encourage you to try this product, as well as Loving Naturals SPF 30 Sunscreen; nothing works better!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for an effective spray</li>
            <li>The spray was a nice mist that I didn&#x27;t need to rub in, though it is recommended.</li>
            <li>I own the Loving Naturals sunscreen which I love.</li>
            <li>I thought I would be receiving an effective and safe product, but that was not the case.  </li>
            <li>Frankly, what&#x27;s not to love about Loving Naturals?</li>
            <li>but if I do find another alternative that works with a better scent, I would make the switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li>Although the smell is a bit overwhelming it did the job.</li>
            <li>I love them both.  </li>
            <li>When I sprayed it on, I was immediately pleased with the smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s is citrusy and lovely.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Worked well on the areas that I am sure it was applied to.</li>
            <li>We live surrounded by threes and espend a good portion of our time in the yard, so these products have been a bless, since we don&#x27;t do quimicals and love outdoors!</li>
            <li>I really wish I could say good things about this spray, but I just sprayed both my kids and I and we all got mosquito bites within 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am blow away by how fabulous this product works &amp; knowing that it is all natural makes me breath easy if by boys fall asleep before a bath!!!</li>
            <li>The smell is really nice - kind of reminds me of a \\&quot;new age\\&quot; candle store.  </li>
            <li>The smell is not unpleasant (except for how very strong it is).</li>
            <li>I like the size, because it is easy to carry along.  </li>
            <li>Great smelling natural insect repellant that is deet free</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell of this spray is quite strong.  </li>

            <li>She did have to apply it more often than the Off, but that was a sacrifice she was willing to make to stay away from chemicals while enjoying pristine nature...</li>
            <li>I first heard about this product by visiting the Loving Naturals website to order some of their sunscreen (also fabulous).  </li>
            <li>I bought this product because it&#x27;s organic, being pregnant I needed something safe.  </li>
            <li>Here is a small, family-owned honest company creating amazing products that are safe, effective, and afforadable.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now found that in order for this to be completely effective, you really have to use a liberal amount of this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this product to try as a Deet Free solution.</li>
            <li>and this was on top of the large quantity of mosquitoes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Aside from the effectiveness and safety of this product, I really like supporting a company like Loving Naturals.  </li>
            <li>If you put it on clothes, use a full amount of laundry soap (and maybe a bit</li>
            <li>If you want to try something more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; (but much stinkier)</li>

            <li>that I&#x27;m pregnant again.  </li>
            <li>and we are outside in the evenings more having bonfires or just enjoying nature</li>
            <li>Plus, the spray is dries quickly and is not sticky.</li>
            <li>As the label promises, it is not sticky and dries quickly as well.    </li>
            <li>, it arrived quickly...</li>

            <li>Also I did have to wash our clothing more than once to get the smell of the repellant out of them, probably due to it containing a lot of oil, but I can live with this inconvenience to be able to use something safe.</li>
            <li>I know that my last update stated that my family was able to use this and remain completely free of bites.  </li>
            <li>Thus far (my oldest is 8)</li>
            <li>How it reacts with their own personal scents.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to apply, safe for even the most sensitive skin, doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor, is long lasting, free of chemicals, and WORKS.  </li>
            <li>Again, I still think it&#x27;s worth it, but just be warned if you are sensitive to strong odors.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant and I have no problem spraying it on my little ones..</li>
            <li>Seriously - not a single one.  :)</li>

            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>Before you believe all of the positive reviews, do your research.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is all natural, no harsh chemicals an it really works.  </li>
            <li>My boyfriend and I were hesitant to use it because it has such a strong scent.</li>
            <li>It does wash off with soap, but even the next day (w/o showering) you will still smell strongly of the stuff.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;ll really be put to the test then (and I&#x27;ll update to tell everyone how it worked.)  </li>
            <li>I have not found a product as safe, natural &amp; great as Loving Naturals insect repellent!</li>
            <li>cause I really don&#x27;t like how it smells.</li>
            <li>I am also very picky about scents and this product does not bother me.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really done a scientific test.    </li>
            <li>How could it be \\&quot;sooo amazing\\&quot; and not work at all for a handful of people and why are several reviewers only reviewing loving naturals products???  </li>
            <li>I took it on a photography trip last week in Upstate New York and came away bite free.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that when my family and I attended the last fireworks show, nobody in my family suffered from a single bite.  </li>
            <li>It worked decently well on the mosquito population in the forests of California.</li>
            <li>I read the great (questionable?)</li>
            <li>My oldest came outside right after I put it on my baby and could smell it from 6 feet away.  </li>
            <li>To my horror, I was bitten 2 times on my left arm and once on my right arm within minutes.  </li>
            <li>live in Minnesota - and</li>
            <li>It was a brand new product</li>
            <li>I happen to be allergic to Deet, which prevented me from using most bug sprays in the past.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a health nut and refuse to use anything but natural products that will not negatively impact my health...</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is a little strong for my husband -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad smell, to my nose, but it is a slew of essential oils - if you have a hard time with strong smells, avoid this like the plague.</li>
            <li>I live in Northern California near the Redwood Forest where we get over 30 inches of rain and are surrounded by wetlands.  </li>
            <li>I am switching to a more effective repellent (unfortunately, probably one with DEET) which is especially important in areas like ours that have a lot of tick carrying deers roaming</li>
            <li>I am so happy to have an insect repellent that is chemical free to use on my child and myself.  </li>
            <li>I bought this looking for an all natural alternative to chemical bug repellents for my children.  </li>
            <li>I have used this on 3 separate occasions and so far it seems to be working.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product and was eaten alive.  </li>
            <li>they have both a sensitive nose...  </li>
            <li>Since my children were born I have stayed away from chemicals like DEET &amp; gone the natural route.</li>
            <li>Well, it claims to have all natural ingredients</li>
            <li>My 3 year old and 2 friends had no complaints.    </li>
            <li>only complaint I have is that it costs so much- :)</li>
            <li>They do sometimes land, they still swarm around, but where this stuff is applied they have not bit myself or my two year old son.</li>
            <li>It may take 2 washes to get the smell completely out, if you use a ton of spray.     </li>
            <li>I have recently become health conscious, particularly regarding my skin.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that each of the reviewers reviewed the same exact products in their history.    </li>
            <li>But I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this be your first line of defense if you&#x27;re visiting a region that may have malaria, dengue, or other mosquito-born diseases(Or even where there may be deer ticks and chiggers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, when we took this down to Central America and stayed at an open space/outdoor jungle hotel, we ended up going through the remainder of the bottle (which was still almost full) quite rapidly.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I was excited to receive it, but doubtful that a bunch of aromatic oils, witch hazel, aloe, and sea salt were actually going to keep mosquitos from biting.  </li>
            <li>So save the Loving Naturals repellent for the backyard bbq&#x27;s and short camping trips and probably opt for something with a little more oomf if you&#x27;ll be in guerilla territory.)bbq&#x27;s and short camping trips and probably opt for something with a little more oomf if you&#x27;ll be in guerilla territory.)</li>
            <li>but only if you put a good amount on your skin but then the smell of repellent is way too overpowering and it lingers on you for awhile and in my opinion, I don&#x27;t really like the smell that much.</li>
            <li>but I am not willing to take a risk on this one after seeing what real reviewers have to say.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really sure Loving Naturals Organic DEET Free Insect Repellent would work; I was a bit skeptical.</li>
            <li>Although I previously thought all of the organic and health products were ineffective scams, I tried Loving Naturals Organic DEET Free Insect Repellent when I needed a totally natural product to repel insects.</li>

            <li> My 3 year old and 2 friends had no complaints.    </li>
            <li> only complaint I have is that it costs so much- :)</li>
            <li> They do sometimes land, they still swarm around, but where this stuff is applied they have not bit myself or my two year old son.</li>
            <li> It may take 2 washes to get the smell completely out, if you use a ton of spray.     </li>
            <li> I have recently become health conscious, particularly regarding my skin.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that each of the reviewers reviewed the same exact products in their history.    </li>
            <li> But I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this be your first line of defense if you&#x27;re visiting a region that may have malaria, dengue, or other mosquito-born diseases(Or even where there may be deer ticks and chiggers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, when we took this down to Central America and stayed at an open space/outdoor jungle hotel, we ended up going through the remainder of the bottle (which was still almost full) quite rapidly.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I was excited to receive it, but doubtful that a bunch of aromatic oils, witch hazel, aloe, and sea salt were actually going to keep mosquitos from biting.  </li>

            <li> but only if you put a good amount on your skin but then the smell of repellent is way too overpowering and it lingers on you for awhile and in my opinion, I don&#x27;t really like the smell that much.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this looking for an all natural alternative to chemical bug repellents for my children.  The mosquitoes in our area are pretty bad and make for a miserable time outdoors.  No more!  This product is easy to apply, safe for even the most sensitive skin, doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor, is long lasting, free of chemicals, and WORKS.  I&#x27;m so grateful to spend time playing with my children outside without being swarmed by bugs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an effective spray and I saw that this product received great reviews.  The only problem is that each of the reviewers reviewed the same exact products in their history.    Is this a coincidence or someone from the company pumping up their products by creating fake reviews?</li>
            <li> I purchased this bug spray for my family to use.  After I read the Cosmetic Safety Data Base website, I&#x27;ve become a tad paranoid.  I don&#x27;t want to expose my family to unnecessary toxins.  spray it on my hand and rub it on my children&#x27;s skin rather than spraying it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in Minnesota - and if you have ever spent a summer evening in this state, you&#x27;ll know how horrendous the mosquitoes can be.  I have used this on 3 separate occasions and so far it seems to be working.  I&#x27;ll be taking my kiddos to a fireworks show next weekend, so it&#x27;ll really be put to the test then (and I&#x27;ll update to tell everyone how it worked.)  I&#x27;ll be bringing along some DEET spray just in case, but I&#x27;m hoping that this will work by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of this spray is quite strong.  My oldest came outside right after I put it on my baby and could smell it from 6 feet away.  It&#x27;s not a horrible smell, but I guess I don&#x27;t find it as pleasant as some reviewers did.  It also was a little hard to wash the smell out of hair and clothes.  Since it works, I don&#x27;t mind using it - but if I do find another alternative that works with a better scent, I would make the switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  This product has passed the test.  I usually get at least a few mosquito bites when attending fireworks shows, fairs, etc.  I can honestly say that when my family and I attended the last fireworks show, nobody in my family suffered from a single bite.  Seriously - not a single one.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd Update:  I&#x27;ve used up the last of the bottle this spring, and it is still working.  However, I&#x27;m now finding the scent to be unpleasant now that I&#x27;m pregnant again.  I know that my last update stated that my family was able to use this and remain completely free of bites.  I&#x27;ve now found that in order for this to be completely effective, you really have to use a liberal amount of this.  Again, I still think it&#x27;s worth it, but just be warned if you are sensitive to strong odors.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because our backyard faces acres upon acres of undeveloped woods and now that it&#x27;s summer and we are outside in the evenings more having bonfires or just enjoying nature, I wanted something to repel the attack-mosquitoes that were making being outside at night unbearable. This stuff actually worked and I had the opportunity to have four other people try it with me and it worked for them as well.     I don&#x27;t have any bad comments about the smell, it smells like citronella and no one had a problem with it. One thing that we noticed is that it almost made the mosquitoes crazy-mad because a few of them started flying at our faces. Not many, and after a while we weren&#x27;t being bugged by the bugs anymore.     I&#x27;d recommend this product to try as a Deet Free solution. It worked for us against our attack-mosquitoes!</li>
            <li> I own the Loving Naturals sunscreen which I love. I came across this product because I wanted to see what other products they offered. I happen to be allergic to Deet, which prevented me from using most bug sprays in the past. I&#x27;ve been the one at the back of the camping/hiking/fishing trips silently feeding millions of mosquitoes and other biting insects in misery for years- until now. I&#x27;ve tried everything on the market and was always disappointed, since all the deet free products I tried either triggered my allergies or just plain didn&#x27;t work. I took it on a photography trip last week in Upstate New York and came away bite free. I&#x27;m not sure it lasts as long as the deet-containing products. My wife, which also started using this exclusively also loved it. She did have to apply it more often than the Off, but that was a sacrifice she was willing to make to stay away from chemicals while enjoying pristine nature...</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after reading all the glowing reviews here at Amazon.  I thought I would be receiving an effective and safe product, but that was not the case.  This product didn&#x27;t work at all.  Before heading outdoors, I sprayed both myself and my son from head to toe, as we are both prone to getting bitten by insects, especially mosquitos.  My son bites tend to swell up and cause him great discomfort so I try my hardest to protect him from being bitten.  To my horror, I was bitten 2 times on my left arm and once on my right arm within minutes.  We were outdoors for less than 10 minutes before I was bitten.  I promptly placed this spray where it belonged - in the trash.  I am switching to a more effective repellent (unfortunately, probably one with DEET) which is especially important in areas like ours that have a lot of tick carrying deers roaming around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am honestly stumped at all the great reviews here.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and was eaten alive.  I followed the application directions very carefully and was still bitten numerous times.  I tried it again the following day using a heavier application and was still bitten on all of the exposed areas.  I live in Northern California near the Redwood Forest where we get over 30 inches of rain and are surrounded by wetlands.  Do not believe the phony reviews that give this product 5 stars.</li>
            <li> All natural insect repellent that is not greasy and keeps the bugs away. The spray was a nice mist that I didn&#x27;t need to rub in, though it is recommended. It is not greasy at all so I didn&#x27;t feel like I had a coating on my skin. The bugs seemed to stay away wherever the spray was. I smell like lemon Pledge when I&#x27;m wearing it, which isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing. :)</li>
            <li> I am so happy to have an insect repellent that is chemical free to use on my child and myself.  I think it smells good, and I don&#x27;t feel guilty if the night gets late and I have to put my child to bed without giving her a bath.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it&#x27;s organic, being pregnant I needed something safe.  Although the smell is a bit overwhelming it did the job.</li>
            <li> I got the insect repellent along with the sunscreen...I love them both.  The repellent keeps far away the bugs from my little boys, and has been effective for the ticks also.   The smell is pleasant and I have no problem spraying it on my little ones..they have both a sensitive nose...  I like the size, because it is easy to carry along.  We live surrounded by threes and espend a good portion of our time in the yard, so these products have been a bless, since we don&#x27;t do quimicals and love outdoors!</li>
            <li> Lots of fishy reviews on here.  How could it be \\&quot;sooo amazing\\&quot; and not work at all for a handful of people and why are several reviewers only reviewing loving naturals products???  They have some good stuff but I am not willing to take a risk on this one after seeing what real reviewers have to say.</li>
            <li> Since my children were born I have stayed away from chemicals like DEET &amp; gone the natural route. Thus far (my oldest is 8) I have not found a product as safe, natural &amp; great as Loving Naturals insect repellent! My family &amp; I have spent the summer outdoors and with this product we have had zero, ZERO mosquito bites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am blow away by how fabulous this product works &amp; knowing that it is all natural makes me breath easy if by boys fall asleep before a bath!!! ;)</li>
            <li> Stop Feeding the Mosquitos! Loving Naturals made a believer out of me!!    I have recently become health conscious, particularly regarding my skin. Although I previously thought all of the organic and health products were ineffective scams, I tried Loving Naturals Organic DEET Free Insect Repellent when I needed a totally natural product to repel insects. I wanted to protect myself during a week-long outdoor music festival, which ran from 12 noon until 1 AM each night. As you know, that is prime mosquito time!     I wasn&#x27;t really sure Loving Naturals Organic DEET Free Insect Repellent would work; I was a bit skeptical. When I sprayed it on, I was immediately pleased with the smell. It&#x27;s is citrusy and lovely. Of course, it is free of DEET (that nasty chemical), but it is also filled with ALL natural, organic ingredients! You can actually read and understand the ingredient list on the label! Plus, the spray is dries quickly and is not sticky. I sprayed it evenly on my skin, clothes and hair. I noticed after several hours, that a few mosquitos were flying around me. I simply reapplied the insect repellent and they left! I only had to reapply it once each night.    Finally, I have stopped feeding the mosquitos! I love this product. It really works! Loving Naturals made a believer out of me! I encourage you to try this product, as well as Loving Naturals SPF 30 Sunscreen; nothing works better!</li>
            <li> I bought this mosquito repellent last year after researching all over amazon for an organic repellent for my 2 and 6 year old.  I read the great (questionable?) reviews and thought it would be great.  It does work but only if you put a good amount on your skin but then the smell of repellent is way too overpowering and it lingers on you for awhile and in my opinion, I don&#x27;t really like the smell that much.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my trip based on the positive reviews...before another reviewer noticed the possible fake reviews. Well, it claims to have all natural ingredients so I wanted to try it. My boyfriend and I were hesitant to use it because it has such a strong scent. The strong scent lingers for a while but it eventually goes away leaving only a slight scent behind on the skin. I am not a fan of smelling like organic oils. It&#x27;s difficult to say if this product really works...at times when I didn&#x27;t use anything, I didn&#x27;t get mosquito bites.. my boyfriend tried everything (including this product and off!) and still got mosquito bites. In conclusion, I won&#x27;t buy this product again cause I really don&#x27;t like how it smells.</li>
            <li> I first heard about this product by visiting the Loving Naturals website to order some of their sunscreen (also fabulous).  It was a brand new product so I figured I would give it a try.  Honestly, I was excited to receive it, but doubtful that a bunch of aromatic oils, witch hazel, aloe, and sea salt were actually going to keep mosquitos from biting.  Boy was I wrong!    The product itself comes in a 4oz. pump spray bottle that is the perfect size for stuffing into my diaper bag or purse.  It is a white liquid in the bottle (shake well before use), but does not spray white or leave any sort of filmy or oily residue on clothing.  The smell is really nice - kind of reminds me of a \\&quot;new age\\&quot; candle store.  It is a strong smell at first but fades a bit with time.  However, the effectiveness does not.  We spray it on just before dusk and it lasts well into the night.  As the label promises, it is not sticky and dries quickly as well.    Aside from the effectiveness and safety of this product, I really like supporting a company like Loving Naturals.  A visit to their website will tell you that they place quality and safety above all else.  They do not use any animal-derived ingredients nor do they test any of their products on animals.  They fully disclose all ingredients and use organic whenever possible.  Here is a small, family-owned honest company creating amazing products that are safe, effective, and afforadable.  Frankly, what&#x27;s not to love about Loving Naturals?</li>
            <li> This product is the greatest.  I love that it is all natural, no harsh chemicals an it really works.  In the past I have suffered through the bug bites because other bug sprays made me feel worse.  I am also very picky about scents and this product does not bother me.</li>
            <li> Great smelling natural insect repellant that is deet free and you can feel good about putting on yourself and your kids. Worked well on the areas that I am sure it was applied to. Nothing will keep all insects (mosquitoes here) away 100%. This was used on myself, 3 men, and a 3 year old little girl.  No one complained except for my husband that got bit around his ankles, but he did not rub the spray around so I can not say that they were protected by the spray.  I only was bitten on the hand and it was after I had washed my hands and forgot to reapply spray to them.  My 3 year old and 2 friends had no complaints.    Also I did have to wash our clothing more than once to get the smell of the repellant out of them, probably due to it containing a lot of oil, but I can live with this inconvenience to be able to use something safe.</li>
            <li> Worked great on our trip to India and also at home.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a little strong for my husband - but I don&#x27;t mind.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an herbal scent.&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is that it costs so much- :)&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it arrived quickly... as promised and worked great...as promised</li>
            <li> We live in MN and without some repellent, even a few minutes in our backyard gets us eaten alive.    The good: This stuff has worked surprisingly well at keeping mosquitoes from biting. They do sometimes land, they still swarm around, but where this stuff is applied they have not bit myself or my two year old son. I spray this on exposed skin as well as thin clothes - we have big mosquitoes. The smell is not unpleasant (except for how very strong it is). This spray also seems to last at least an hour, maybe two. Haven&#x27;t really done a scientific test.    The bad: this stuff is VERY strong smelling. It&#x27;s not a bad smell, to my nose, but it is a slew of essential oils - if you have a hard time with strong smells, avoid this like the plague. It does wash off with soap, but even the next day (w/o showering) you will still smell strongly of the stuff. If you put it on clothes, use a full amount of laundry soap (and maybe a bit more)when you wash these clothes. It may take 2 washes to get the smell completely out, if you use a ton of spray.     The unknown: I suspect that, since this uses essential oils, it won&#x27;t work well for some people. How it reacts with their own personal scents. I don&#x27;t know how well this stuff has worked for my wife, and she&#x27;s a mosquito magnet (I don&#x27;t need to wear repellent when she&#x27;s out, they like her so much).    In short, if you need guaranteed protect, use DEET. If you want to try something more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; (but much stinkier) try this stuff, but it probably won&#x27;t work for everyone.</li>
            <li> Before you believe all of the positive reviews, do your research.  Those reviews were done by the company or people associated with the company.  Don&#x27;t believe the 5 star reviews, this stuff is crap!  DO NOT BUY AND DO NOT SUPPORT COMPANIES WHO PUT UP ARTIFICIAL REVIEWS!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a health nut and refuse to use anything but natural products that will not negatively impact my health...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I purchased this for a camping trip initially, then ended up using it in the jungle/tropics of Central America. It worked decently well on the mosquito population in the forests of California. We applied it to parts of our bodies that we didn&#x27;t have covered by clothing (it was still cold out, so we were all in long pants and long sleeves. Between the thick clothing, the repellant, citronella candles, and a fire pit constantly burning, we had little to no bites upon our return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when we took this down to Central America and stayed at an open space/outdoor jungle hotel, we ended up going through the remainder of the bottle (which was still almost full) quite rapidly. This area had a type of fly, Diachlorus ferrugatus (aka: yellow fly, doctor fly), that bit hard and often - and this was on top of the large quantity of mosquitoes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We applied the repellant to our entire bodies, hair, face, clothing, shoes, armpits and in between our toes... we did everything but brush our teeth with it. As we sat at breakfast, lunch or dinner at the outdoor dining areas (since everything was outdoors), we were forced to keep the bottle on the table with us and stop what we were doing to reapply every 5, 10, or 15 minutes. If we didn&#x27;t, we became unwilling donors to the entire yellow fly population.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... yes, this stuff works. But I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this be your first line of defense if you&#x27;re visiting a region that may have malaria, dengue, or other mosquito-born diseases(Or even where there may be deer ticks and chiggers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(On a side note: The bugs were so bad down there that the company we rented our truck from told us that some of the locals use diesel when they have to spend prolonged periods in the jungle.... yes, diesel as in diesel fuel. So save the Loving Naturals repellent for the backyard bbq&#x27;s and short camping trips and probably opt for something with a little more oomf if you&#x27;ll be in guerilla territory.)bbq&#x27;s and short camping trips and probably opt for something with a little more oomf if you&#x27;ll be in guerilla territory.)</li>
            <li> I really wish I could say good things about this spray, but I just sprayed both my kids and I and we all got mosquito bites within 15 minutes. Very disappointed. At the price it costs, save your money.</li>
