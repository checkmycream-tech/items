            <li>We also purchased Neoteric Diabetic Advanced Healing Cream, 4 Ounce as it helps with circulation and healing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Neoteric Diabetic Advanced Healing Cream, 4 Ounce</li>
            <li>What a great value and super fast shipping - I highly recommend this item!</li>
            <li>This worked ok, but I didn&#x27;t notice it being any more effective than any other healing cream.</li>
            <li>trying this for the first time so far so good</li>
            <li>Used the product twice and had to stop because of tremendous burning and pain.</li>
            <li>I could not believe how quickly this helped her feet heal.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read a lot of stories about products providing quick recovery ect, but this product really does make a difference.</li>
            <li>This product is the ONLY one I have found that has been able to heal my dermatitis issues and keep them healed.  </li>
            <li>The doctor put her on antibiotic&#x27;s which did not seem to help much.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This stuff really worked, I was surprised, and you really didn&#x27;t need  a lot.</li>
            <li>the doctor has been having me put on every 3-5 days was not producing any new results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why it works so well, but I&#x27;m glad that it does.</li>
            <li>I use it as a preventive measure to aviod infection, and so far it is working.</li>
            <li>About another 2 days of using the cream and legs were back to normal.</li>
            <li>Use sparingly, tube is small but very powerful..</li>
            <li>I am giving it three stars even though it did not heal my sores only because it did relieve the pain considerably.  </li>
            <li>And I paid half of the price my drug store wanted for the exact same thing.</li>

            <li> This feels so good on my feet.  I am diabetic.</li>
            <li> Used the product twice and had to stop because of tremendous burning and pain.</li>
            <li> This product is the ONLY one I have found that has been able to heal my dermatitis issues and keep them healed.  This product is great.</li>
            <li> trying this for the first time so far so good</li>
            <li> I ordered this to aid with water retention blisters on my husbands legs.  I use it as a preventive measure to aviod infection, and so far it is working.</li>
            <li> I am an insulin dependant diabetic who has suffered from ulcers on my stomach for about two years.  My doctor has tried all sorts of expensive treatments to heal them, none of which worked.  I tried TriDerma, and the ulcers healed in three days.  And I paid half of the price my drug store wanted for the exact same thing.</li>
            <li> After trying several like products from local drug stores, etc I decided to try TryDema before going to doctor.  In 3 days no more constant pain from ulcers n in a week ulcers on feet / ankle were healing. Two weeks now n I&#x27;m good!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great!  I&#x27;ve been dealing with 2 problematic Diabetic pressure ulcers on my feet for the last 14 months and the prescription Puracol plus AG the doctor has been having me put on every 3-5 days was not producing any new results.  Out of frustration I guess I decided to try something else.  I tried this product as my ulcers were not huge but would not close completely and they are actually starting to close now.  I may actually be able to do stuff this summer if it continues.  I am very happy with the product so far. (I should mention it is probably not wise to deviate from your doctor&#x27;s orders even though I had positive results you may not)</li>
            <li> What a great value and super fast shipping - I highly recommend this item!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read a lot of stories about products providing quick recovery ect, but this product really does make a difference. I had a bunch of little ulcers on my legs and applied this cream after trying at least 5 others.  When I applied the cream my legs were swollen, red and severely inflamed. After 3-5 days the ulcers healed over, the inflammation, redness and pain was gone. About another 2 days of using the cream and legs were back to normal. I&#x27;m not sure why it works so well, but I&#x27;m glad that it does. I even apply it to other wounds to accelerate the healing time. I highly recommend trying this product, if you have difficultly healing.</li>
            <li> This product is a life saver!  My daughter has diabetes and had ulcers on her feet.  It seemed to spread from one foot to the other and then on different parts on each foot.  The doctor put her on antibiotic&#x27;s which did not seem to help much.  She spent a horrible few months barely able to walk before I came across this cream on Amazon.  Thanks to all of you, who wrote reviews which helped inform me on a good choice for my daughter.  I could not believe how quickly this helped her feet heal.  She continues to use this as a preventative measure and has excellent results.  We will always have this on hand as a staple in our medicine kit.  We also purchased Neoteric Diabetic Advanced Healing Cream, 4 Ounce as it helps with circulation and healing.  Both are excellent products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neoteric Diabetic Advanced Healing Cream, 4 Ounce</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Used it to aid in healing my elderly mother bedsores.  Sores started to fade away with days. Use sparingly, tube is small but very powerful.. Very satisfied. I highly recommend it! Will order again soon.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;y work the way i thought it would</li>
            <li> I used this on my mother after she had surgery.  She had several scrapes and things all over.  This worked ok, but I didn&#x27;t notice it being any more effective than any other healing cream.</li>
            <li> Great items, great price, great shipping from a great dealer.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This stuff really worked, I was surprised, and you really didn&#x27;t need  a lot. A little on the pricy side, but hey if it works.</li>
            <li> I USED IT FOR MY HUSBAND WHO IS IN A LOCKED MIND. SINCE HE DOES NOT MOVE AND CANNOT TURN AROUND ON HIS OWN HE IS LIABLE TO BROKEN SKIN. IT HELPS IN CURING</li>
            <li> I am giving it three stars even though it did not heal my sores only because it did relieve the pain considerably.  I used three tubes over a period of about to months and I could not see that any healing took place.</li>
            <li> i FOLLOWED THE DIRECTIONS TO THE LETTER ON THIS ONE AS WELL AND IT DID NOT HEAL MY WOUNDS, I AM SO DISAPPOINTED IN BOTH THIS PRODUCTS AND WOUND BE GONE.. DOES NOT DO WHAT IT CLAIMS IT WILL DO... UPSET AND OUT OF MONEY</li>
            <li> I have struggled for years to heal up and this has made the most progress of anything I have tried</li>
