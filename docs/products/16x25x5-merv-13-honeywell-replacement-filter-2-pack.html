            <li>Fit is perfect.</li>
            <li>Fit perfectly into our Carrier 2 Stage unit.</li>
            <li>It is NOT a Honeywell product, it is rather a suitable size replacement made by another company that fits a Honeywell media filter unit.  </li>
            <li>The filter is of good quality, and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This should not be a problem for most consumers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;they are ok.</li>
            <li>Flimsy, but they fit in my furnace, and I&#x27;m satisfied with the price.  </li>
            <li>The dimensions of the filter were as advertized and fit with no issues in my air filter slot.</li>
            <li>This was the cheap choice, and that&#x27;s what i got.  </li>
            <li>But happy with it, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I change the filters 2 times a year every Spring and Fall to keep our home clean and dust free.</li>
            <li>Received our air filters very fast and accurately!</li>
            <li>I use 4 of them yearly and the Merv 13 truely keeps the system clean and reduces any dust in our home.</li>
            <li>Upon learning of the delay, the manufacturer took prompt and effective action.    </li>
            <li>Aside from having to contact the seller because I didn&#x27;t know which side to put &amp;#34;UP&amp;#34;, the filter is doing its job - and the air seems to be clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>These arrived quickly and were priced competitively.  </li>
            <li>It slides right like it is supposed too.</li>
            <li>The price was very reasonable considering that most box stores sell one unit for almost the same amount!</li>
            <li>Next time i&#x27;ll get the better filter.</li>
            <li>Our HVAC serviceman recommended we buy filters with a Merv rating of 13 or higher.  </li>
            <li>First time I mistakenly ordered a 16x25x5 instead of the 20x25x5 filter.  </li>
            <li>Also, while Honeywell filters (which apparently are no longer available) come collapsed thereby reducing shipping costs, the MERV filters came ready to instal thereby reducing installation time.    </li>
            <li>5\\&quot; deep furnace filters that are quite a bit less than retail price, work very well, arrive in good condition and arrive quickly.  </li>
            <li>I change them every 6 months (instead of quarterly) and they&#x27;re very efficient.</li>
            <li>We aren&#x27;t sneezing as much and this filter has helped lesson the dust in the air and on the furniture.</li>
            <li>It fit perfectly (third time a charm).  </li>
            <li>The Lennox documentation says this is the correct size, but what it really wants is a filter 4.375&amp;#34</li>
            <li>We actually placed a duplicate order after our original order arrived so we have a spare on hand.</li>
            <li>The deliver was quick and the company includes a neat reminder magnet that you stick to your furnace so it is much easier to order in the future.</li>
            <li>The Home Depot and Lowes near our home do not stock anything higher than a 12 rating.  </li>
            <li>Given the cost savings, I can live with this!</li>
            <li>There is a bump uased as a guide in the slot for the elements so when inserting the air filter lift the air filter as high as you can during insertion.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend purchasing this through Amazon.</li>
            <li>So far as evaluating the filters is concerned, I do not feel capable of doing so.  </li>
            <li>In addition I was pleased to receive this product in just a few days.</li>
            <li>The filters have fewer pleats than the original Honeywell filters and therefore have somewhat less filter area, but I have no way to know whether that reduces their effectiveness.  </li>
            <li>This is my 2nd time buying from this seller, and as always it ships fast</li>
            <li>and I am starting to wonder how much air is being filter.  </li>
            <li>We always run the A/C and Heat and very seldom open our windows.</li>
            <li>However, when I tried to replace it, the filter is actually a little bit too tall and the width is a bit shorter than the original filter comes with the system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It would be necessary to measure the pressure drop across the filter, its effectiveness in capturing small particles of dust, and how much it is able to capture before the pressure drop increases.  </li>
            <li>it was too wide (was 5&amp;#34; exactly).  </li>
            <li>To early to tell since I have installed last week.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little difficult to rate air filters but this filter seems to be doing a good job as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t tell you if they are actually a Merv 13 or not because they looked exactly like the filter that was installed previously that was not.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Product was sold as a Honeywell Replacement Filter ~ by Honeywell.  It is NOT a Honeywell product, it is rather a suitable size replacement made by another company that fits a Honeywell media filter unit.  I rate it a 3, but it may be less as the months go along depending on the air quality output over time.</li>
            <li> A good product at a good price. The dimensions of the filter were as advertized and fit with no issues in my air filter slot. The filter material and fan-fold pattern seem to be the same as the more expensive Name Brand products. Keep in mind that this is an after market product, so no frills. The size and installation information is only stamped on one edge, the rest of the filter frame is plain white. So in my specific installation/air flow direction, the edge of the filter with the Size, Type and Flow direction arrows stamped on it ends up being upside down and hidden on the back side when inserted into the filter slot. Given the cost savings, I can live with this!</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Stated dimensions (actual size) is incorrect/erroneous on Amazon product page, web site. Actual size is NOT 15 7/8 x 24 3/4 x 4 3/8. Upon receiving the filters I discovered the actual filter (width) size is 4 1/4 inches, which is slightly smaller in width only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This should not be a problem for most consumers. It would be prudent for Amazon/ Filter-Guru to update product dimension (actual filter size). This is a quality filter, MERV 13 rating.</li>
            <li> Good quality at a good price. Filter is a little deeper than expected, but still fits.</li>
            <li> 5\\&quot; deep furnace filters that are quite a bit less than retail price, work very well, arrive in good condition and arrive quickly.  I change them every 6 months (instead of quarterly) and they&#x27;re very efficient.</li>
            <li> These arrived quickly and were priced competitively.  They have fewer folds and may not filter as well as those I purchased elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Flimsy, but they fit in my furnace, and I&#x27;m satisfied with the price.  I can&#x27;t verify the MERV value, and I haven&#x27;t noticed a reduction in dust around the house, but they serve their purpose. Installed for over a month now.</li>
            <li> This was the cheap choice, and that&#x27;s what i got.  There are no labels, no documentation.  The paper is thin, the cardboard is thin.  I read the recommended replacement interval is 6 months, instead of the 12 expected by the OEM.  Next time i&#x27;ll get the better filter.</li>
            <li> It took slightly longer for the filters to arrive than it should have, but that seems to be the result of an error by the carrier and not by the filter manufacturer.  Upon learning of the delay, the manufacturer took prompt and effective action.    So far as evaluating the filters is concerned, I do not feel capable of doing so.  Evaluating them would require instruments which I do not have.  It would be necessary to measure the pressure drop across the filter, its effectiveness in capturing small particles of dust, and how much it is able to capture before the pressure drop increases.  That&#x27;s a job for a well-equipped laboratory.    The filters have fewer pleats than the original Honeywell filters and therefore have somewhat less filter area, but I have no way to know whether that reduces their effectiveness.  Also, while Honeywell filters (which apparently are no longer available) come collapsed thereby reducing shipping costs, the MERV filters came ready to instal thereby reducing installation time.    I&#x27;m sorry that I am unable to do a better job of evaluating the filters, but there are some products which consumers cannot accurately evaluate.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd time buying from this seller, and as always it ships fast and it comes with 2. It slides right like it is supposed too. Will be purchasing again in the future.</li>
            <li> Great item great price, will buy again once I need a replacement. It has help with cleaning the air in our house.</li>
            <li> Our HVAC serviceman recommended we buy filters with a Merv rating of 13 or higher.  The Home Depot and Lowes near our home do not stock anything higher than a 12 rating.  The product shipped and arrived when promised.  We actually placed a duplicate order after our original order arrived so we have a spare on hand.</li>
            <li> We used this air filter to replace the electronic air cleaner from Honneywell F50F 1073 since caring for the cleaner elements takes quite a bit of time and I am starting to wonder how much air is being filter.  Fits well as a replacement.  There is a bump uased as a guide in the slot for the elements so when inserting the air filter lift the air filter as high as you can during insertion.</li>
            <li> Aside from having to contact the seller because I didn&#x27;t know which side to put &amp;#34;UP&amp;#34;, the filter is doing its job - and the air seems to be clean and fresh. I recommend them.</li>
            <li> I order these filters every year. I use 4 of them yearly and the Merv 13 truely keeps the system clean and reduces any dust in our home. The builder had the OE Honeywell filters in the system but these work as well at half the cost. I actually think the originals were only a Merv 10. Not more than I say about these filters except they are well constructed and never fail. I change the filters 2 times a year every Spring and Fall to keep our home clean and dust free. We always run the A/C and Heat and very seldom open our windows.</li>
            <li> The filter is of good quality, and shipped quickly. However, the size of the filter out of the box is not as listed here. The length of 24 3/4 inches, rather than 24 1/4 inches as listed, lead to some manual fixing to get it to work in our setup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, it is what it is. But I will probably be going with the official supplier next time, to avoid any hassle.</li>
            <li> To early to tell since I have installed last week. So far, no much difference. However I wish they had the arrow mark to know which side to install it and saving me some researching time.</li>
            <li> Not available locally so I decided to try ordering on-line. Good decision on my part. The deliver was quick and the company includes a neat reminder magnet that you stick to your furnace so it is much easier to order in the future. Great customer service.</li>
            <li> I loved this product up until I went to install it in our furnace&#x27;s filter receptacle.  This product is 4 7/8\\&quot; wide, not the 4 3/8\\&quot; nominal width claimed in the product description.  As such, it is not a physical replacement for Honeywell FC100A1029 or FC200E1029 filters, which are a nominal 4 3/8\\&quot; wide.  Good price, but worthless as described.  I will be asking for an RMA as I can&#x27;t use these filters.</li>
            <li> I have bought the filter based on the filter size specified. However, when I tried to replace it, the filter is actually a little bit too tall and the width is a bit shorter than the original filter comes with the system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed at this vendor and I will never buy from the vendor again. For those of you out there, be careful of vendor like this.</li>
            <li> Fit is perfect. The dust reduction in the house was almost immediate, of course the filter it replaced was due for replacement, so some of that was simply due to the fact it was a new vs. an old filter. But happy with it, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Fit perfectly into our Carrier 2 Stage unit. I couldn&#x27;t tell you if they are actually a Merv 13 or not because they looked exactly like the filter that was installed previously that was not.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little difficult to rate air filters but this filter seems to be doing a good job as far as I can tell. We aren&#x27;t sneezing as much and this filter has helped lesson the dust in the air and on the furniture. I would buy this product. again.</li>
            <li> Received our air filters very fast and accurately!</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly. Just as described.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT WILL NOT BUY AGAIN  REASON SHIPPING FEE I HAVE PRIME</li>
            <li> I was so pleased to find a double pack for this difficult to find size furnace filter. The price was very reasonable considering that most box stores sell one unit for almost the same amount! In addition I was pleased to receive this product in just a few days. I highly recommend purchasing this through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great&lt;br /&gt;they are ok. Kinda so so&lt;br /&gt; Wish you.had of had 16 merv</li>
            <li> It fit perfectly (third time a charm).  First time I mistakenly ordered a 16x25x5 instead of the 20x25x5 filter.  Second time I ordered a 20x25x5 filter an it was too wide (was 5&amp;#34; exactly).  The Lennox documentation says this is the correct size, but what it really wants is a filter 4.375&amp;#34; wide.</li>
