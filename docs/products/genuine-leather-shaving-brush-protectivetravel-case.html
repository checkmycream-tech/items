            <li>Works great, I love it.</li>

            <li>and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get good use out of it</li>

            <li>so I can take my nice brush with me.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t care how many blades you put in a plastic handle and up the price; IT WILL NEVER SHAVE AS GOOD AS</li>
            <li>This case allows it to breath and protects it nicely.</li>
            <li>Keeps things nice and neat.  </li>
            <li>I love the Genuine Leather Brush case, it looks great.</li>
            <li>Perfect fit for my Escali  100% pure badger bristle shaving brush.</li>
            <li>This case is as elegant as it is well constructed.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It makes you feel like you more of a man.</li>
            <li>The brush fits in perfectly and there&#x27;s enough exposure to the air to keep it drying.</li>
            <li>Much better than just throwing the brush in a travel kit.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be glad you ordered this item</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll soften up with use.</li>
            <li>Keeps my shaving brush safe when I travel</li>
            <li>It does what it is supposed to do, what more can you ask.</li>
            <li>I am on the road more than I am home and so wanted to take some of the comforts with me.</li>
            <li>Its ok.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s better than this case.</li>
            <li>Brush fits inside, and the case does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, but the leather feels more like vinyl.</li>
            <li>Three more words</li>
            <li>This simple, inexpensive, and easy to use case is perfect for storing at home or travel abroad.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li>, this is the way to keep your brush safe and clean</li>
            <li>I agree, it did have a strong scent, but I bet it would subside over time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice unit and I&#x27;m glad one is available for em to buy that&#x27;s made of real leather.</li>
            <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t like that residual smell, but now love it because I feel more rugged.  </li>
            <li>this little holder is indeed EXCELLENT and a must have if you travel.  </li>
            <li>Cheaply made, Do not buy.</li>
            <li>Heavy leather and it holds my Art of Shaving brush perfectly.</li>
            <li>Snag and secure.</li>
            <li>Taller brushes probably won&#x27;t fit well.</li>
            <li>I travel a lot with my job and find this case to be indispensable for my needs.</li>
            <li>I actually enjoy shaving again and I&#x27;ve been doing that for over 50 years...</li>
            <li>My brush fits securely and I can throw it into the bottom of my travel kit without worries.  </li>
            <li>Helps keep the brush clean and free from damage.</li>
            <li>If you enjoy a good shave done in classic fashion, then you likely have a nice boar brush to lather up the shaving soap.</li>
            <li>It seems like a nice compliment to my new razor.  </li>
            <li>helps keep brush clean and intact.</li>
            <li>Overall, I think I made a good purchase.</li>
            <li>The product was all that it was described to be, the shipping was fast, and I love the product.</li>
            <li>Good solid product for the price.  </li>
            <li>For now it&#x27;s good enough for my kit bag.</li>
            <li>Good craftsmanship and will probably last forever.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d spend much more than this for something in my travel kit (I do use an older cheaper brush and razor as well)</li>
            <li>This could be genuine leather, but has a funny smell, sort of like shoe polish.</li>
            <li>Really disappointed too, because I&#x27;ve been looking for a good case for my Edwin Jagger Best Boar brush.</li>
            <li>Nice workmanship too; should last a good long while.</li>
            <li>This is a great little pouch that keeps my brush protected while in my hygiene bag.  </li>
            <li>Fits and protects regular size shaving brush nicely.</li>
            <li>The case is made of good leather and it stays closed.</li>
            <li>Very nice little case.</li>
            <li>I just gently squeeze excess water from my brush, insert the handle first and the leather gently wraps over the bristles without hardly touching them.  </li>
            <li>And, hey, that&#x27;s the object, right?</li>
            <li>I really enjoy leather products and this one here (along with the companion product from the same maker which holds the razor) is good quality, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Great product and accommodates several different size razors.</li>
            <li>Size-wise it holds the brush perfectly, it does not get loose and the material is soft enough for you to handle with ease</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice way to travel with your wet shave brush.  </li>
            <li>I use this to travel with my Omega 13109 brush; I had a screw type travel brush that rusted the first time out.  </li>
            <li>I was worried about it from the picture, but its much nicer in person!</li>
            <li>This thing does exactly what I need it to do.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Placing the shaving brush in handle first aligns all the bristles in one direction.</li>
            <li>My regular shave brush can&#x27;t be replaced by any travel model and this case is an elegant and practical way for me to take it on the road with me.</li>
            <li>I bought this so that I could take my good shaving brush with me on a trip, instead of taking my old cruddy brush that I didn&#x27;t care how ruined it got bouncing around in the hygiene kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After more than ten thousand miles and many packings and unpackings, my brush survived beautifully.</li>
            <li>Clean soft leather, looks and feels quality.</li>
            <li>Good quality, fits Merkur 38c and Future, as well as my standard Edwin Jagger.</li>
            <li>This is a good, simple case to protect your shaving brush for trips of a short duration.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just what I needed for my Travel looks very classic.</li>
            <li>Just make sure your brush is fully dry before putting in the case.</li>
            <li>This case kept the bristles neat and tidy, and even putting a slightly damp brush in it didn&#x27;t hurt the brush or the leather</li>
            <li>it keeps the bristles nice and tight between shaves.</li>
            <li>I have used it for two different size brushes and fits them just fine.  </li>
            <li>Nothing fancy; nice little case.</li>
            <li>Second, I really doubt that this is genuine leather; think vinyl.</li>
            <li>Still very functional</li>
            <li>This is a MUCH nicer way to travel.</li>
            <li>I do travel a lot, but this isn&#x27;t really something that takes a beating.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t weight that much.</li>
            <li>This case is made of real leather and it does the job of protecting my brush form being banged up.  </li>
            <li>A real bargain.</li>
            <li>This is real leather and fits my medium size</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that the pouch hold up very well, with no signs of alteration.</li>
            <li>This looks like a very cheap plastic imitation.  </li>
            <li>If you need something in a bind or just don&#x27;t want to spend much, it&#x27;s probably a decent option, but don&#x27;t expect too much from it.</li>
            <li>The leather is pretty nice, it keeps my brush bristles from getting damaged by all my other toiletries which are all kept together in the same box.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for to complete my travel kit.</li>
            <li>good quality but not way to keep it closed since there is no pin on the latch to keep it from coming loose.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>Rate high because it met my expectations.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend or travel.</li>
            <li>If you travel, you don&#x27;t want to toss it in a bag and have it get all beat up, or never dry properly - right?</li>
            <li>Very well made, a classy way to bring a shving brush along.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to like it, but since it was only $15, I figured I didn&#x27;t have much to loose.  </li>
            <li>big enough to fit a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; size knot on the brush.</li>
            <li>I recently switched from the can to a brush and found a completely different experience that I truly enjoy.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected and exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>not a deal breaker by far but still something that should be noted if you are going to keep a high end brush in this case.</li>
            <li>I used this recently for the first time while travelling.</li>
            <li>dry brush is going to have a better time traveling in this case than a wet brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Stiff leather, which is fine.</li>
            <li>may have trouble getting a brush with a huge bloom in the case though.</li>
            <li>The brush case arrived early and as advertised.</li>
            <li>As far as the razor, I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if this case needs maintenance with saddle soap, or if it will take the shape of the brush handle using the old isopropyl alcohol trick.</li>
            <li>has a classy look too.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this thing will last more than a few years.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a tiny bit more stiff as it arrived than I would prefer (might just be my opinion) to me</li>
            <li>This case is just the right size for my shave brush without being to big taking up valuable extra room in my suitcase.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes you look classy and bad-ass at the same time.</li>
            <li>It works fine, it&#x27;s not high end but not cheap plastic either.</li>
            <li>As usual, the entire experience was super.  </li>
            <li>The brush&#x27;s bristles dry as well as if it were hung up near the sink.</li>

            <li> And, hey, that&#x27;s the object, right?</li>
            <li> I really enjoy leather products and this one here (along with the companion product from the same maker which holds the razor) is good quality, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Great product and accommodates several different size razors.</li>
            <li> Size-wise it holds the brush perfectly, it does not get loose and the material is soft enough for you to handle with ease</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice way to travel with your wet shave brush.  </li>
            <li> I use this to travel with my Omega 13109 brush; I had a screw type travel brush that rusted the first time out.  </li>
            <li> I was worried about it from the picture, but its much nicer in person!</li>
            <li> This thing does exactly what I need it to do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Placing the shaving brush in handle first aligns all the bristles in one direction.</li>
            <li> My regular shave brush can&#x27;t be replaced by any travel model and this case is an elegant and practical way for me to take it on the road with me.</li>
            <li> I bought this so that I could take my good shaving brush with me on a trip, instead of taking my old cruddy brush that I didn&#x27;t care how ruined it got bouncing around in the hygiene kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After more than ten thousand miles and many packings and unpackings, my brush survived beautifully.</li>
            <li> Clean soft leather, looks and feels quality.</li>
            <li> Good quality, fits Merkur 38c and Future, as well as my standard Edwin Jagger.</li>
            <li> This is a good, simple case to protect your shaving brush for trips of a short duration.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for my Travel looks very classic.</li>
            <li> Just make sure your brush is fully dry before putting in the case.</li>
            <li> This case kept the bristles neat and tidy, and even putting a slightly damp brush in it didn&#x27;t hurt the brush or the leather</li>
            <li> it keeps the bristles nice and tight between shaves.</li>
            <li> I have used it for two different size brushes and fits them just fine.  </li>
            <li> Nothing fancy; nice little case.</li>
            <li> Second, I really doubt that this is genuine leather; think vinyl.</li>
            <li> Still very functional</li>
            <li> This is a MUCH nicer way to travel.</li>
            <li> I do travel a lot, but this isn&#x27;t really something that takes a beating.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weight that much.</li>
            <li> This case is made of real leather and it does the job of protecting my brush form being banged up.  </li>
            <li> A real bargain.</li>
            <li> This is real leather and fits my medium size</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that the pouch hold up very well, with no signs of alteration.</li>
            <li> This looks like a very cheap plastic imitation.  </li>
            <li> If you need something in a bind or just don&#x27;t want to spend much, it&#x27;s probably a decent option, but don&#x27;t expect too much from it.</li>
            <li> The leather is pretty nice, it keeps my brush bristles from getting damaged by all my other toiletries which are all kept together in the same box.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for to complete my travel kit.</li>
            <li> good quality but not way to keep it closed since there is no pin on the latch to keep it from coming loose.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Rate high because it met my expectations.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend or travel.</li>
            <li> If you travel, you don&#x27;t want to toss it in a bag and have it get all beat up, or never dry properly - right?</li>
            <li> Very well made, a classy way to bring a shving brush along.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to like it, but since it was only $15, I figured I didn&#x27;t have much to loose.  </li>
            <li> big enough to fit a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; size knot on the brush.</li>
            <li> I recently switched from the can to a brush and found a completely different experience that I truly enjoy.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected and exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> not a deal breaker by far but still something that should be noted if you are going to keep a high end brush in this case.</li>
            <li> I used this recently for the first time while travelling.</li>
            <li> dry brush is going to have a better time traveling in this case than a wet brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Stiff leather, which is fine.</li>
            <li> may have trouble getting a brush with a huge bloom in the case though.</li>
            <li> The brush case arrived early and as advertised.</li>
            <li> As far as the razor, I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if this case needs maintenance with saddle soap, or if it will take the shape of the brush handle using the old isopropyl alcohol trick.</li>
            <li> has a classy look too.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this thing will last more than a few years.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tiny bit more stiff as it arrived than I would prefer (might just be my opinion) to me</li>
            <li> This case is just the right size for my shave brush without being to big taking up valuable extra room in my suitcase.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes you look classy and bad-ass at the same time.</li>
            <li> It works fine, it&#x27;s not high end but not cheap plastic either.</li>
            <li> As usual, the entire experience was super.  </li>
            <li> The brush&#x27;s bristles dry as well as if it were hung up near the sink.</li>
            <li> Almost big enough for a small electric razor, but too large for double edged safety razor.  </li>
            <li> Really, who can complain when it costs so little!</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s pretty common with the chemically treated leathers these days.</li>
            <li> However I travel extensively and throwing a brush into my kit assured that it would not be long for this world.</li>
            <li> took a week long trip and packed up several times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is open to the air and so helps the brush to dry.</li>
            <li> More classy &amp; no more expensive than some of those plastic tubes.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t leave it in your bag long.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, but I&#x27;m going to guess that leather, water, and badger fur aren&#x27;t going to be long term buddies.</li>
            <li> The case protects your clothes, and lets the brush dry.  </li>
            <li> but it provides enough ventilation you can put a slightly damp brush in it.</li>
            <li> The leather is not too hard or too soft.</li>
            <li> The gap in the leather at the bottom of the pouch is big enough for you to get at least a pinky finger in and push the brush out by the handle rather than pulling the brush out by the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The one I received was well made and functions like I expected.</li>
            <li> The only thing I think it&#x27;s missing is a magnet clasp instead of a belt-loop style fastener.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend putting a wet brush in it</li>
            <li> Sometimes the bristles catch and bend up if you arent careful sliding the brush in, but this would happen with any case.</li>
            <li> This product was everything I expected it would be.</li>
            <li> The tether is thick enough that it doesn&#x27;t shift back and forth in the loop even while stored in my toiletry bag.  </li>
            <li> It could also be used for other item storage purposes.</li>
            <li> I purchased two other parker products (Safety Razor case:</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very stiff, and, truth be told, it looks pretty poor.</li>
            <li> Mine&#x27;s starting to show some serious signs of wear after having lived in my dopp kit during travel.</li>
            <li> I had been using an Edwin Jagger travel brush but was not real pleased.</li>
            <li> It even leaves a slight leather smell on my brush.  </li>
            <li> The material of the case is sturdy so there&#x27;s no problem even if the brush is a little damp.</li>
            <li> Hope to save others the waste of money</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found a way around it, but I think once the case is broken in, the brush will simply slide out.  </li>
            <li> It works, but is a little stiff and bulky.</li>
            <li> Leather is a bit stiff and plastickie(word?).</li>
            <li> The leather is a bit stiff but should soften over time.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I will end up using it or not.</li>
            <li> It is a small price to pay to protect something that brings a sense of civility to the rigors of the road.</li>
            <li> Very stiff and rigid.  </li>
            <li> It is a very stiff and thick leather that protects every bristle on my brush.  </li>
            <li> Nothing complex here.</li>
            <li> Thick leather.</li>
            <li> First, it has a terrible odor.</li>
            <li> Quality of the leather is rather poor.</li>
            <li> It does hold my brush, but getting it out is awkward, you have to pull it up by the brush bristles, not a good idea on an expensive silver tip badger.</li>
            <li> If you travel and want to take your shave brush with you then you can&#x27;t go wrong with this brush holder.</li>
            <li> The odor of the product was unbelievably bad.  </li>
            <li> Bad choice on my part.  </li>
            <li> Bad design, so I had to return it.</li>
            <li> so as not to be disappointed when lost.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001O8NCI4 B001O8NCI4]]  and Toiletry Bag: [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Just terrible.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Size-wise it holds the brush perfectly, it does not get loose and the material is soft enough for you to handle with ease, it looks the part and is not too bulky.&lt;br /&gt;It makes you look classy and bad-ass at the same time.</li>
            <li> This is a well made travel case for my Parker Shaving Brush. Best made brush I&#x27;ve owned sense I started using them in 1968. The case protects your clothes, and lets the brush dry.  SW</li>
            <li> Quality of the leather is rather poor. Looks almost plasticky or pleather like. Also had a scuff. Still very functional and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get good use out of it</li>
            <li> This is great for travel protects shaving brush, or use for storing it!! I highly recommend this item!!</li>
            <li> big enough to fit a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; size knot on the brush. good quality but not way to keep it closed since there is no pin on the latch to keep it from coming loose. not a deal breaker by far but still something that should be noted if you are going to keep a high end brush in this case.</li>
            <li> I love the Genuine Leather Brush case, it looks great. Just what I needed for my Travel looks very classic.</li>
            <li> Brush fits well and won&#x27;t get ruined</li>
            <li> Very stiff and rigid.  Almost big enough for a small electric razor, but too large for double edged safety razor.  Not sure if I will end up using it or not.</li>
            <li> I used this to travel to two countries and it worked perfectly. Kept my brush in perfect condition. I would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I recently switched from the can to a brush and found a completely different experience that I truly enjoy. However I travel extensively and throwing a brush into my kit assured that it would not be long for this world. This case is as elegant as it is well constructed. It is a small price to pay to protect something that brings a sense of civility to the rigors of the road. If you use a brush you need one of these.</li>
            <li> Great fit and keeps the brush from being destroyed in my shaving kit.</li>
            <li> This looks like a very cheap plastic imitation.  The odor of the product was unbelievably bad.  Bad choice on my part.  Hope to save others the waste of money</li>
            <li> Love it. It makes you feel like you more of a man. And definitely looks well made</li>
            <li> Upon taking the brush out of the case you risk damaging the bristles. They get caught on the folded edges. Bad design, so I had to return it. I agree, it did have a strong scent, but I bet it would subside over time. Really disappointed too, because I&#x27;ve been looking for a good case for my Edwin Jagger Best Boar brush.</li>
            <li> This case works well and does what it is designed for.  The leather is not too hard or too soft.</li>
            <li> Fits my shave brush perfect. Haven&#x27;t had a chance to use this product yet but will soon. Looks and feels like a great product.</li>
            <li> Terreble case doesn&#x27;t work, ughhh</li>
            <li> Very nice little case. The brush fits in perfectly and there&#x27;s enough exposure to the air to keep it drying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice way to travel with your wet shave brush.  I like that it keeps the bristles nice and tight between shaves.</li>
            <li> If you enjoy a good shave done in classic fashion, then you likely have a nice boar brush to lather up the shaving soap. If you travel, you don&#x27;t want to toss it in a bag and have it get all beat up, or never dry properly - right? This is a nice case, you just have to let it air out a bit after you get it but that&#x27;s pretty common with the chemically treated leathers these days.</li>
            <li> I use this to travel with my Omega 13109 brush; I had a screw type travel brush that rusted the first time out.  I gave it 4 stars because I&#x27;m a bit of a leather nut, owning a lot of Saddleback leather products....I don&#x27;t think this thing will last more than a few years.  If it does, I&#x27;ll adjust my review to a 5.</li>
            <li> It works fine, it&#x27;s not high end but not cheap plastic either. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d spend much more than this for something in my travel kit (I do use an older cheaper brush and razor as well) so as not to be disappointed when lost.</li>
            <li> Rate high because it met my expectations.  Has opening at the bottom that allows you to push the brush out.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this purchase.  It seems like a nice compliment to my new razor.  I recommend this case.</li>
            <li> I had been using, of all things, a cardboard tube to protect my travel brush.  This is a MUCH nicer way to travel.</li>
            <li> I have a Baxter Best Badger brush and it slides in very easily into this travel case. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 months, the brush is doing well and I don&#x27;t regret this purchase. If you&#x27;re the travelling type this is a must have to avoid damaging your brush.</li>
            <li> It will do well for storing my shaving brush during travel. Appears well made and of leather. It could also be used for other item storage purposes.</li>
            <li> If you have a shaving brush, get this. It smells wonderful, it protects your shaving brush, it makes you feel more manly. And, hey, that&#x27;s the object, right?</li>
            <li> This leather travel brush case is very nice and strong. With care it should last a life time. Very nicely manufactured. Thank&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I really enjoy leather products and this one here (along with the companion product from the same maker which holds the razor) is good quality, especially for the price. Highly recommend or travel.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made, Do not buy. Find another product</li>
            <li> Nothing complex here. The one I received was well made and functions like I expected. Much better than just throwing the brush in a travel kit. Protects the brush and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room in the bag. I can recommend this as a travel companion to your shaving kit.</li>
            <li> This could be genuine leather, but has a funny smell, sort of like shoe polish. Seems somewhat plasticky.  However, appears well constructed, holds brush well and lets it drain.  Works well on trips so I can take my nice brush with me.  Smell decreasing over time, holding up well. Will save you buying one of the fancy (read:expensive) travel brushes.</li>
            <li> Heavy leather and it holds my Art of Shaving brush perfectly. Simple product with no issues. Will probably last for years.</li>
            <li> Great product and accommodates several different size razors. Good quality and price point. You&#x27;ll be glad you ordered this item</li>
            <li> Perfect protection for a badger hair shave brush. The leather is good quality. I was worried about it from the picture, but its much nicer in person! My boyfriend loved it!</li>
            <li> Really, who can complain when it costs so little! Need some protection for your shaving brush? Look no further. This simple, inexpensive, and easy to use case is perfect for storing at home or travel abroad. Helps keep the brush clean and free from damage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice unit and I&#x27;m glad one is available for em to buy that&#x27;s made of real leather. It&#x27;s a tiny bit more stiff as it arrived than I would prefer (might just be my opinion) to me but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll soften up with use. The only thing I think it&#x27;s missing is a magnet clasp instead of a belt-loop style fastener. Other than that it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> Very well made, a classy way to bring a shving brush along.</li>
            <li> works fairly well for what it was designed for.  I would recommend</li>
            <li> Keeps my shaving brush safe when I travel</li>
            <li> It holds a shaving brush, but it feels very low quality. Mine&#x27;s starting to show some serious signs of wear after having lived in my dopp kit during travel. I do travel a lot, but this isn&#x27;t really something that takes a beating. It shouldn&#x27;t be showing wear yet. It&#x27;s also very stiff, and, truth be told, it looks pretty poor. If you need something in a bind or just don&#x27;t want to spend much, it&#x27;s probably a decent option, but don&#x27;t expect too much from it.</li>
            <li> Thick leather. well made. may have trouble getting a brush with a huge bloom in the case though. Bought a perfecto brush just for travel purpose and it fits perfecto</li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to do, what more can you ask.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Protects your brush. More classy &amp; no more expensive than some of those plastic tubes. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend putting a wet brush in it but it provides enough ventilation you can put a slightly damp brush in it. Just don&#x27;t leave it in your bag long.</li>
            <li> Works great, I love it.</li>
            <li> The leather is pretty nice, it keeps my brush bristles from getting damaged by all my other toiletries which are all kept together in the same box. Inexpensive investment that serves its purpose.</li>
            <li> I used this recently for the first time while travelling. Did what it&#x27;s supposed to do. No complaints. Nice workmanship too; should last a good long while.</li>
            <li> This leather shaving brush case is great for keeping my shaving brush in when I travel.  It doesnt smash the brissles and is still compact enough to not take up my entire shaving kit.  Would recommend this for quality, size and price.  Was shipped out immediately and recieved within three days.</li>
            <li> Holds my brush for travel, doesn&#x27;t damage or allow the bristles to get damaged either. Good look to it, too.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit for my Escali  100% pure badger bristle shaving brush. Snag and secure. Doesn&#x27;t weight that much.</li>
            <li> Fits and protects regular size shaving brush nicely. Taller brushes probably won&#x27;t fit well. Leather is a bit stiff and plastickie(word?). Well stitched; does the job.</li>
            <li> My brush used to role around in my hygiene bag.  The bristles would be bent, and the handle would be nicked and dented.  This case is made of real leather and it does the job of protecting my brush form being banged up.  The reason for the four out of five, is the fact that I have to pull the brush out by its bristles.  I haven&#x27;t found a way around it, but I think once the case is broken in, the brush will simply slide out.  Overall, I think I made a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I had been using an Edwin Jagger travel brush but was not real pleased. I ordered a 22mm knot Whipped Dog Silvertip Firehouse handle shaving brush. I am on the road more than I am home and so wanted to take some of the comforts with me. Now I needed to protect that brush. This works perfectly. It also works for my 24mm knot WD brush and will probably hold brushes larger than that. It is open to the air and so helps the brush to dry. I would not leave home without it. A real bargain.</li>
            <li> The brush case arrived early and as advertised. I&#x27;m looking forward to taking my good shaving equipment with me when I travel this summer!</li>
            <li> As usual, the entire experience was super.  The product was all that it was described to be, the shipping was fast, and I love the product.</li>
            <li> This case is just the right size for my shave brush without being to big taking up valuable extra room in my suitcase. I travel a lot with my job and find this case to be indispensable for my needs. If you travel and want to take your shave brush with you then you can&#x27;t go wrong with this brush holder.</li>
            <li> I got this for a trip I took to Korea to visit family.  I worked great.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to like it, but since it was only $15, I figured I didn&#x27;t have much to loose.  I was amazed at the quality.  I purchased two other parker products (Safety Razor case: [[ASIN:B001O8NCI4 B001O8NCI4]]  and Toiletry Bag: [[ASIN:B007SOZ1OQ B007SOZ1OQ]] ) and I have been very impressed with their quality.</li>
            <li> Good solid product for the price.  Brush fits snugly in the case although sometimes too snug.  I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> This is real leather and fits my medium size Boars Hair brush perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took a week long trip and packed up several times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No problems. It kept The brush perfectly shaped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you travel and want to take DE kit with you, this is the way to keep your brush safe and clean</li>
            <li> The case is made of good leather and it stays closed. Its a simple product that does the job. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> a very nice case to have.  helps keep brush clean and intact.</li>
            <li> serves its purpose. Stiff leather, which is fine. Sometimes the bristles catch and bend up if you arent careful sliding the brush in, but this would happen with any case.</li>
            <li> A great idea to travel with shaving brush.  On the road I use shave gel in cup heated in microwave and spread lather with my brush. I like having my brush on the road and not just at home.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve gone back &amp;#34;Old School&amp;#34; and purchased a total of Four (4) Vintage Gillette &amp;#34;Adjustable&amp;#34; razors, I&#x27;ve gone back to using a &amp;#34;Boar Bristle Brush&amp;#34; too.  As far as the razor, I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I actually enjoy shaving again and I&#x27;ve been doing that for over 50 years...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care how many blades you put in a plastic handle and up the price; IT WILL NEVER SHAVE AS GOOD AS A GILLETTE RAZOR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be that as it may; I digress a bit... this little holder is indeed EXCELLENT and a must have if you travel.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bj</li>
            <li> This thing does exactly what I need it to do. I just wish that the leather look matched the travel razor case that Parker also has in its shop.</li>
            <li> I have two shaving brushes, one at home and one in my travel kit.  The brush at home is well protected but the one in my travel kit was getting a bit beat up.  This case is the solution to the problem.  My brush fits securely and I can throw it into the bottom of my travel kit without worries.  The material of the case is sturdy so there&#x27;s no problem even if the brush is a little damp.</li>
            <li> Perfect for what it is advertised for.  I have used it for two different size brushes and fits them just fine.  Just make sure your brush is fully dry before putting in the case.</li>
            <li> Good quality, fits Merkur 38c and Future, as well as my standard Edwin Jagger. Nothing fancy; nice little case. Quality addition to my shaving set.</li>
            <li> It works, but is a little stiff and bulky. Razor tends to move around a lot. Bottom line it protects the razor.</li>
            <li> Great Quality, Great Price.</li>
            <li> Its ok.  I don&#x27;t like stuffing a damp brush in it.  I bought a $1 holder for a bar of soap.  I think it&#x27;s better than this case.</li>
            <li> Brush fits inside, and the case does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, but the leather feels more like vinyl.</li>
            <li> this is going back! Just terrible.  First, it has a terrible odor. Second, I really doubt that this is genuine leather; think vinyl. It does hold my brush, but getting it out is awkward, you have to pull it up by the brush bristles, not a good idea on an expensive silver tip badger.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected and exactly what I needed. The leather is a bit stiff but should soften over time.</li>
            <li> Because I am in the Navy, I wanted to find a way to store and protect my brush.  It is a very stiff and thick leather that protects every bristle on my brush.  I just gently squeeze excess water from my brush, insert the handle first and the leather gently wraps over the bristles without hardly touching them.  The brush&#x27;s bristles dry as well as if it were hung up near the sink. The tether is thick enough that it doesn&#x27;t shift back and forth in the loop even while stored in my toiletry bag.  It absorbs moisture well.  It even leaves a slight leather smell on my brush.  At first, I didn&#x27;t like that residual smell, but now love it because I feel more rugged.  After a month, that leather smell hasn&#x27;t gone away yet.</li>
            <li> Great case! I travel a lot and was worried about damaging my brush. This case allows it to breath and protects it nicely.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, but I&#x27;m going to guess that leather, water, and badger fur aren&#x27;t going to be long term buddies. This is a good, simple case to protect your shaving brush for trips of a short duration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The inside of the travel case appears to have a plastic backing. The edges of the leather is sealed, so that should protect the leather a bit. The case has plenty of gaps to let moisture out (or vice versa).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Placing the shaving brush in handle first aligns all the bristles in one direction. The gap in the leather at the bottom of the pouch is big enough for you to get at least a pinky finger in and push the brush out by the handle rather than pulling the brush out by the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A dry brush is going to have a better time traveling in this case than a wet brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if this case needs maintenance with saddle soap, or if it will take the shape of the brush handle using the old isopropyl alcohol trick. For now it&#x27;s good enough for my kit bag.</li>
            <li> Clean soft leather, looks and feels quality. I use it to carry my best boars brush when traveling. My brush is a bigger one and it fits like a champ. has a classy look too.</li>
            <li> This product was everything I expected it would be.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for to complete my travel kit. My regular shave brush can&#x27;t be replaced by any travel model and this case is an elegant and practical way for me to take it on the road with me. Great product!</li>
            <li> I bought this so that I could take my good shaving brush with me on a trip, instead of taking my old cruddy brush that I didn&#x27;t care how ruined it got bouncing around in the hygiene kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After more than ten thousand miles and many packings and unpackings, my brush survived beautifully. This case kept the bristles neat and tidy, and even putting a slightly damp brush in it didn&#x27;t hurt the brush or the leather case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brilliant!</li>
            <li> This is a great little pouch that keeps my brush protected while in my hygiene bag.  I don&#x27;t know how this product could be improved.</li>
            <li> Does a great job at protecting the badger brush ( Escali http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003WR3QSG/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_img_sol_1 )  through my travels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Often times, I have to pack the brush when it&#x27;s still humid and I just have shaken it a couple times (checking out of hotels in the morning...). I&#x27;ve found that the pouch hold up very well, with no signs of alteration. I also love the faint but luxurious leather smell it gives off...</li>
            <li> This fits my brush perfectly.  Good craftsmanship and will probably last forever.  Keeps things nice and neat.  Three more words</li>
