            <li>This one seems to work better than the rest! : )</li>

            <li>This brush is by far the best product I&#x27;ve ever purchased from Amazon.</li>
            <li>This product is the most durable and reliable of its kind.  </li>

            <li>Nothing more to say.</li>
            <li>I love this brush, gas given my beard more volume and a better appearance</li>
            <li>Great quality,  highly recommended!</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Instant awesome.</li>
            <li>I received this brush last week and the quality is excellent.</li>
            <li>its curves perfect to your jaw bone, and the real boar hair makes it not only comfortable and scratch free on your skin, it makes your beard look GREAT!</li>
            <li>I just think my beard responds better to it.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.  </li>
            <li>I plan to order a couple more to have one at work and one in my ride too.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always a pleasant surprise when the product arrives in the mail looking exactly like the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll never want to use another brush as the Black Boar Beard Brush showcases how amazing it is to have a beard and make yourself proud to have one!!</li>
            <li>But after using this brush and beard oil, I have noticed my beard becoming thicker, haven&#x27;t seen an ingrown hair since I started using it, and I use it on my shaved cheeks, but I notice more stubble growing in there</li>
            <li>Great brunch soft on skin and manages stray hairs well</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s strong,</li>
            <li>Very soft and good design.</li>
            <li>Delivered promptly and the product is accurately portrayed as shown.</li>
            <li>Only downside is the price but the quality is great</li>
            <li>so I suppose it&#x27;s justified</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally, I use Smooth Viking products, they just work well for me.</li>
            <li>me to keep my beard at a longer length because it does not look to wild.&lt;br /&gt;real wooden handle, feels great in your hand&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The quality is sound, but if you have anything close to a &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; beard it seems to glide over it, as oppose to through it.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Leaves it feeling soft and it feels really good to use.</li>
            <li>The real handle just tops off this brush, comfortable, manly, easy to use because it curves with your face!.  </li>
            <li>I just got this today and was excited to use it after reading all the rave reviews.  </li>
            <li>Received brush super quick!</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Bought the brush several weeks ago for my husband and it has held together great, has made his beard look so much nicer that I decided to buy another brush for my son in laws Father&#x27;s Day gift</li>
            <li>Something smooth on your face is going to be gentle on your beard, and I&#x27;ve used it when my beard was longer</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and my beard looks great.</li>
            <li>Just a great firm brush that tames the Appalachian bird nest.</li>
            <li>It is very soothing and comfortable to use as well.</li>
            <li>It worked nicely, I bought this based on the price and reviews just so I could have a second for travel/backup.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Train your hairs to grow the right way!&lt;br /&gt;Keeps your face exfoliated so NO FLAKES!&lt;br /&gt;Improves circulation, in turn improving complexion and stimulating hair</li>
            <li>I took it right to task brushing my beard and about three minutes into brushing</li>
            <li>Great firm brush with, from what I can tell, 100% real boar hair.</li>
            <li>I use this thing all day long to keep my beard taimed down, and it works excellent with beard oil as well.</li>
            <li>Very durable and stiff, great for an unruly beard.</li>
            <li>If you have soft hair, you&#x27;ll probably be fine, but if you have thicker coarser hair, this may not be the brush for you.  </li>
            <li>Might be a good idea for the Black Boar team to sell two different versions of this brush to provide better options for their customers.</li>
            <li>So I just received my brush after a mishap that was sent to me with the first one.  </li>
            <li>Sadly I&#x27;ll never get there.  </li>
            <li>and I love that my man has his beard swag back haha ; )</li>
            <li>I keep my &amp;#34;beard&amp;#34; to be just a little more than stubble, because my job requires I wear an n95 respirator mask, and really even this beard length is not aloud (but I passed the fit test with it like this, so why not?)</li>
            <li>the real problem was the first time using it a noticeable am out of bristles started falling out.</li>
            <li>The Black Boar is just amazing.</li>
            <li>From the first use it tamed my hair better than the other.</li>
            <li>The first was handmade, 100% real and high quality.</li>
            <li>Really?  </li>
            <li>The curved bristles make it much easier to work around the lip area.</li>
            <li>real hair, not plastic/hair mix</li>
            <li>design on the bristles makes it match my face really well</li>
            <li>20 points for me!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s made very well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and firm</li>
            <li>The fibers were long enough and strong enough to tame my beard and spread my beard oil.&lt;br /&gt;Loved the contour shape and excellent wood quality!...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend as it meets all of my expectations</li>
            <li>It is a high quality brush I use for my bodacious beard.  </li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for the thinner sides of my beard, but the middle is too much man for this little brush, so minus one star.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t bother looking at any other brush regardless of how cheap they are because you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li>The curve of the brush makes it feel like it was made to be in and around your facial area ;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I went with this one because he&#x27;s had it for a few weeks and loves it!</li>
            <li>It has tamed my wild man beard and gotten it under control like no other brush I have tried before, and I have tried more than a few.</li>
            <li>It preforms by the boar bristles evenly distributing the natural oils from the hair shaft and straightening the hair out to prevent split ends and irritation of the skin.</li>
            <li>Hubby just grew a beard for the first time, and never really thought about a brush for it.</li>
            <li>Do I think it&#x27;s higher quality than the other?</li>
            <li>The first one was missing bristles, but I contacted their support and they sent me a new replacement immediately.  </li>
            <li>From the box it comes in, to the wooden handle, to the bristles, it all comes together to make my beard smooth and tame.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This may not be its intended use, but i&#x27;m basically saying that using this bad boy directly on your skin is comfortable and smooth.</li>
            <li>Feels slightly rough on the first use, but your skin definitely gets used to it.</li>
            <li>I brush up/against grain first to lift and coat, then I brush down and smooth/dress beard.</li>
            <li>I may have lost a few on the first use but that was it.</li>
            <li>Great brush!!...while I had it, it fell out of my backpack on the train a week later :(  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 100% natural boars hair that is stiff enough to get the job done but soft enough that it&#x27;s not harsh on your skin.</li>
            <li>If my beard could get blue balls it would have them thanks to Black Boar.</li>
            <li>I especially like the slight curve in the bristles, really helps conform to the shape of your face.</li>
            <li>If your beard is hard to handle this is a necessity well worth the money.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m glad I went with this one because he&#x27;s had it for a few weeks and loves it!</li>
            <li> It has tamed my wild man beard and gotten it under control like no other brush I have tried before, and I have tried more than a few.</li>
            <li> It preforms by the boar bristles evenly distributing the natural oils from the hair shaft and straightening the hair out to prevent split ends and irritation of the skin.</li>
            <li> Hubby just grew a beard for the first time, and never really thought about a brush for it.</li>
            <li> Do I think it&#x27;s higher quality than the other?</li>
            <li> The first one was missing bristles, but I contacted their support and they sent me a new replacement immediately.  </li>
            <li> From the box it comes in, to the wooden handle, to the bristles, it all comes together to make my beard smooth and tame.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This may not be its intended use, but i&#x27;m basically saying that using this bad boy directly on your skin is comfortable and smooth.</li>
            <li> Feels slightly rough on the first use, but your skin definitely gets used to it.</li>
            <li> I brush up/against grain first to lift and coat, then I brush down and smooth/dress beard.</li>
            <li> I may have lost a few on the first use but that was it.</li>
            <li> Great brush!!...while I had it, it fell out of my backpack on the train a week later :(  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 100% natural boars hair that is stiff enough to get the job done but soft enough that it&#x27;s not harsh on your skin.</li>
            <li> If my beard could get blue balls it would have them thanks to Black Boar.</li>
            <li> I especially like the slight curve in the bristles, really helps conform to the shape of your face.</li>
            <li> If your beard is hard to handle this is a necessity well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Using this in the morning and occasionally in the evening has helped it lay down better.&lt;br /&gt;Difference between this brush and my other, this feels more firm and slightly less dense as far as number of bristles.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brush to anyone from a long &amp;#34;Duck Dynasty&amp;#34; style beard to a small cowboy mustache, you definitely need to purchase this product.  </li>
            <li> so long as you don&#x27;t go bananas.</li>
            <li> Lost a few hairs from the brush the first few times using it,  but not anymore.  </li>
            <li> Then use this Black Boar brush to further spread/saturate into beard.</li>
            <li> The bristles aren&#x27;t too soft or too hard for his face and beard.</li>
            <li> As for the brush itself, like the other reviews, I felt the bristles were softer than they should be.  </li>
            <li> After reading reviews about the hairs falling out of a lot of the other brushes I reluctantly ordered this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush as a gift for my boyfriend who has been growing out his beard for the past several months (as part of a beard care package!).</li>
            <li> Just because your beard doesn&#x27;t respond doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s low quality.</li>
            <li> Get the Black Boar.</li>

            <li> He&#x27;d tried a few brushes but didn&#x27;t really like them - they were badly made and didn&#x27;t seem to actually do anything for his beard : /</li>
            <li> I have had my brush for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> Stiff, but doesn&#x27;t scratch or rub you</li>

            <li> Thank you Black Boar!!</li>
            <li> Brand new brush and the sanding on the handle before staining is horrible.</li>
            <li> This Boar brush makes bad beard days, to shame!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> The Black Boar is just amazing. Feels slightly rough on the first use, but your skin definitely gets used to it. I purchased one for my mustache and one for my father-in-law who has a beard. We both use it every day over our cheeks and neck and believe this will change your life as you know it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get rid of ITCHY BEARD!&lt;br /&gt;Train your hairs to grow the right way!&lt;br /&gt;Keeps your face exfoliated so NO FLAKES!&lt;br /&gt;Improves circulation, in turn improving complexion and stimulating hair growth!&lt;br /&gt;Contours perfectly to your face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy synthetic bristle brushes or anything plastic. Get the Black Boar. You won&#x27;t regret it! Nothing more to say.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, gas given my beard more volume and a better appearance</li>
            <li> Great brush, it hasn&#x27;t fallen apart. I&#x27;ve had it for a month and it&#x27;s still going strong. It&#x27;s nice and firm but it&#x27;s not scratchy at all.</li>
            <li> Great product. Like the fact it&#x27;s curved for easier brushing of a beard.</li>
            <li> So I just received my brush after a mishap that was sent to me with the first one.  The first one was missing bristles, but I contacted their support and they sent me a new replacement immediately.  That&#x27;s great customer service!  As for the brush itself, like the other reviews, I felt the bristles were softer than they should be.  If you have soft hair, you&#x27;ll probably be fine, but if you have thicker coarser hair, this may not be the brush for you.  Might be a good idea for the Black Boar team to sell two different versions of this brush to provide better options for their customers.</li>
            <li> I keep my &amp;#34;beard&amp;#34; to be just a little more than stubble, because my job requires I wear an n95 respirator mask, and really even this beard length is not aloud (but I passed the fit test with it like this, so why not?) But after using this brush and beard oil, I have noticed my beard becoming thicker, haven&#x27;t seen an ingrown hair since I started using it, and I use it on my shaved cheeks, but I notice more stubble growing in there too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may not be its intended use, but i&#x27;m basically saying that using this bad boy directly on your skin is comfortable and smooth. Something smooth on your face is going to be gentle on your beard, and I&#x27;ve used it when my beard was longer (~3/4 inch) and it worked WONDERS straightening it out.</li>
            <li> Nice quality for the money. Quick shipping. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Excellent beard brush!  Lost a few hairs from the brush the first few times using it,  but not anymore.  I use this thing all day long to keep my beard taimed down, and it works excellent with beard oil as well. Great quality,  highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Great brunch soft on skin and manages stray hairs well</li>
            <li> One of the best beard brushes I&#x27;ve ever used. It works great, feels wonderful, and is very comfortable without the metal or plastic bristles. Five stars and very pleased with my product. Will spread references and info of this amazing product to all of my guys.</li>
            <li> I just got this today and was excited to use it after reading all the rave reviews.  Comes in a nice box, is amazingly the perfect size.  I took it right to task brushing my beard and about three minutes into brushing I&#x27;ve already got bristles falling out.  UGH.  Really?  I guess there&#x27;s a reason it&#x27;s on sale.  For the THREE MINUTES it worked I was on my way to the best beard ever.  Sadly I&#x27;ll never get there.  If my beard could get blue balls it would have them thanks to Black Boar.</li>
            <li> Delivered promptly and the product is accurately portrayed as shown. Stiff, but doesn&#x27;t scratch or rub you raw- so long as you don&#x27;t go bananas. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Very durable and stiff, great for an unruly beard.</li>
            <li> I have had my brush for a few weeks now and I absolutely love it. I use it everyday and my beard looks great.</li>
            <li> Instant awesome. Just a great firm brush that tames the Appalachian bird nest.</li>
            <li> Kinda dissapointed in this. Brand new brush and the sanding on the handle before staining is horrible. It has ripples In it. But that&#x27;s just cosmetics the real problem was the first time using it a noticeable am out of bristles started falling out. Figured hey break in period.  But no over the course of a week it continued to happen. Rather than pick brush hairs from my beard this coming week I threw it in the trash and ordered a wood comb from lumberjack comb co.</li>
            <li> Great beard brush for someone who has longer beard and is worried about pulling out hairs. Very soft and good design.</li>
            <li> Bought the brush several weeks ago for my husband and it has held together great, has made his beard look so much nicer that I decided to buy another brush for my son in laws Father&#x27;s Day gift</li>
            <li> I received this brush last week and the quality is excellent. After reading reviews about the hairs falling out of a lot of the other brushes I reluctantly ordered this one. I may have lost a few on the first use but that was it. I&#x27;ve been using this brush on my beard for a few days now and really like the feel. It&#x27;s 100% natural boars hair that is stiff enough to get the job done but soft enough that it&#x27;s not harsh on your skin. Only downside is the price but the quality is great so I suppose it&#x27;s justified</li>
            <li> From the box it comes in, to the wooden handle, to the bristles, it all comes together to make my beard smooth and tame. It is very soothing and comfortable to use as well.</li>
            <li> Great brush for a mans beard</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always a pleasant surprise when the product arrives in the mail looking exactly like the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My fiance loves this brush and I thought it was neat that it was contoured. The bristles aren&#x27;t too soft or too hard for his face and beard.</li>
            <li> Hubby just grew a beard for the first time, and never really thought about a brush for it. His mom and I kept calling him scruffy, so he started using this brush in conjunction with beard oil and have seen great results. Brush seems well made, only time will tell on longevity. So far so good.</li>
            <li> Bearded boyfriend very happy. Great for head too. Not too stiff bristles. Doesnt scratch.</li>
            <li> Looking for something to apply your beard oil/balm/conditioner? This is the brush for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I use Smooth Viking products, they just work well for me. Use small amount as directed, massage into beard, coating root to tip as possible with fingers first. Then use this Black Boar brush to further spread/saturate into beard. I brush up/against grain first to lift and coat, then I brush down and smooth/dress beard. The curved bristles make it much easier to work around the lip area.</li>
            <li> The curve of the brush makes it feel like it was made to be in and around your facial area ;)</li>
            <li> Ohh man!! My beard is loving me right now!! This brush is amazing. It has tamed my wild man beard and gotten it under control like no other brush I have tried before, and I have tried more than a few. No more itch, no more mess, and no more grippy wife! Thank you Black Boar!!</li>
            <li> Great firm brush with, from what I can tell, 100% real boar hair. Great for my curly beard and hair. Helps get the kinks out without making my hair (head and chin a like) into a fluffy mess. Perfect for spreading your beard oil/balm/conditioner of choice nice and even. I especially like the slight curve in the bristles, really helps conform to the shape of your face.</li>
            <li> Great product.. Very pleased</li>
            <li> Using this brush gave my beard a much better appearance! Would never use anything else!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;ALL real hair, not plastic/hair mix&lt;br /&gt;Soft bristles don&#x27;t scratch face when using&lt;br /&gt;curve design on the bristles makes it match my face really well&lt;br /&gt;allows me to keep my beard at a longer length because it does not look to wild.&lt;br /&gt;real wooden handle, feels great in your hand&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;none for me</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t tell you how awesome this brush is. its curves perfect to your jaw bone, and the real boar hair makes it not only comfortable and scratch free on your skin, it makes your beard look GREAT! The real handle just tops off this brush, comfortable, manly, easy to use because it curves with your face!.  I could see the difference almost instantly. This Boar brush makes bad beard days, to shame!!</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW!! This brush is amazing I was going to shave my beard until my friend told me about this brush it fits your face perfect and the boar hair is soft on your skin no scratching at all. If your beard is hard to handle this is a necessity well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush as a gift for my boyfriend who has been growing out his beard for the past several months (as part of a beard care package!). He&#x27;d tried a few brushes but didn&#x27;t really like them - they were badly made and didn&#x27;t seem to actually do anything for his beard : / I&#x27;m glad I went with this one because he&#x27;s had it for a few weeks and loves it! 20 points for me!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s made very well (even the packaging was really nice), it&#x27;s strong, it&#x27;s contoured and it makes his beard look great. He likes that it makes his beard seem fuller and healthier and I love that my man has his beard swag back haha ; )&lt;br /&gt;If you have a man with a beard this is a great gift and if you are a bearded man yourself then I hope my bf&#x27;s experience helps. This one seems to work better than the rest! : )</li>
            <li> Works amazingly! It&#x27;s great for using with beard oil and evenly distributing it. It&#x27;s taming my stray hairs also.</li>
            <li> This is my second brand I&#x27;ve bought for a boar hair brush. The first was handmade, 100% real and high quality. It worked nicely, I bought this based on the price and reviews just so I could have a second for travel/backup. From the first use it tamed my hair better than the other. Do I think it&#x27;s higher quality than the other? No. I just think my beard responds better to it. So sometimes I feel lower reviews are unwarranted. Just because your beard doesn&#x27;t respond doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s low quality. My beard isn&#x27;t curly but definitely unruly. Hairs just kinda pointing every direction. Using this in the morning and occasionally in the evening has helped it lay down better.&lt;br /&gt;Difference between this brush and my other, this feels more firm and slightly less dense as far as number of bristles.</li>
            <li> Great brush!!...while I had it, it fell out of my backpack on the train a week later :(  but while I used it it was excellent quality. The fibers were long enough and strong enough to tame my beard and spread my beard oil.&lt;br /&gt;Loved the contour shape and excellent wood quality!... While it lasted D:</li>
            <li> Best purchase for any guy who has a beard. Leaves it feeling soft and it feels really good to use. Feels like it exfoliates the l skin under as well. Great quality I suggest you buy one asap. Bear oil plus this awesomeness.</li>
            <li> Received brush super quick! I have been looking for a beard brush for a while and thought I&#x27;d try this one. Very satisfied with look, feel, and quality of the brush. I highly recommend as it meets all of my expectations</li>
            <li> The quality is sound, but if you have anything close to a &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; beard it seems to glide over it, as oppose to through it. It&#x27;s great for the thinner sides of my beard, but the middle is too much man for this little brush, so minus one star.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  I plan to order a couple more to have one at work and one in my ride too.  It is a high quality brush I use for my bodacious beard.  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> This brush is by far the best product I&#x27;ve ever purchased from Amazon. This product is the most durable and reliable of its kind.  It preforms by the boar bristles evenly distributing the natural oils from the hair shaft and straightening the hair out to prevent split ends and irritation of the skin. I highly recommend this brush to anyone from a long &amp;#34;Duck Dynasty&amp;#34; style beard to a small cowboy mustache, you definitely need to purchase this product.  Don&#x27;t bother looking at any other brush regardless of how cheap they are because you get what you pay for.  Right now, you&#x27;re looking at the best brush on the market. You&#x27;ll never want to use another brush as the Black Boar Beard Brush showcases how amazing it is to have a beard and make yourself proud to have one!!</li>
