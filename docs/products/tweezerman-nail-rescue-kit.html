            <li>They are mini versions but fit comfortably in my hand.</li>

            <li>I am enjoying it very much for the convenience to have ha nail clipper with me at all times.  </li>
            <li>I love the stainless cuticle pusher too, and the fact that it comes in a little case that fits in my purse - perfect.  </li>
            <li>The carry case is  the perfect small size.</li>
            <li>the small size fits perfectly in a purse</li>
            <li>I was excited to receive this product but immediately knew it wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li>Really nice set in a great hard case.</li>
            <li>They are all great quality, as can be expected from tweezerman.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved tweezerman products especially the their cuticle trimmer.</li>
            <li>It gives a good tactile response and feedback so that you don&#x27;t cut too deep.</li>
            <li>It should mostly be used for travel and just being really portable.  </li>
            <li>This is only good for an emergency traveling kit.</li>
            <li>Fits in the palm of your hand, and Tweezerman has a great guarantee on keeping their items sharp.</li>
            <li>Nippers - are sharp and work great for cuticles and hang nails.&lt;br /&gt;File</li>
            <li>PETITE,JUST RIGHT OR FIXING THAT SNAGGED NAIL, HANGNAIL AND FOR A QUICK CLEAN UNDER THE NAIL.</li>
            <li>Little nips, not big cuts of cuticle is the best way to use the nipper.&lt;br /&gt;The metal nail file, I haven&#x27;t used because I have many others</li>
            <li>The high quality little kit has made me very happy and prevented trips to the nail salon.</li>
            <li>Super useful.</li>
            <li>great little kit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely worth purchasing.</li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>The double ended cuticle pusher and cleaner is a nice tool as well, I feel</li>
            <li>This nipper is a lot better quality than my old travel one, I don&#x27;t see it breaking from extended use.</li>
            <li>Very nice little kit.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it several times and I&#x27;m really glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>You just have to make sure that the file is in the middle when you put the lid on, or it doesn&#x27;t want to close all the way.  </li>
            <li>HAHA!</li>
            <li>Nice sharp hangnail clipper and file.  </li>
            <li>I have large hands, but can still use these well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with this kit, considering what I really wanted was a cuticle trimmer and this costs less than the larger tweezerman cuticle trimmer by itself ($22).  </li>
            <li>It would be nice if the nail file was a little longer.</li>
            <li>Organized and travel ready.</li>
            <li>You can use it all the time and not worry about much wear and tear.</li>
            <li>The cuticle pusher is solid, smooth, and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Either way, the tools do what they&#x27;re intended for very well and the kit deserves 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t for the used appearance of the case and clipper sheath.</li>
            <li>-  is a standard metal file and gets the job done for shaping the free edge of my nails.&lt;br /&gt;Pusher -  I like the flat side for smooth cuticle pushing&lt;br</li>
            <li>the tools are about 2 to 2 1/2&amp;#34; long so they are easily packed in a suitcase/travel bag, pocket or purse.</li>
            <li>I love my Tweezerman items but due to the Easter Holidays nobody was around to get the package with the Nyx cosmetics.  </li>
            <li>I found this mini set for about the same price as the full size cutters.</li>
            <li>The little set has some nice tools, but would be complete if it had a nail clipper in it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommended it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I needed a new set of cuticle nippers and when I found these tweezer-style ones, I was hooked!  Very sharp and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I lost those ones and when I was searching for new ones online</li>
            <li>New , came in about a week.</li>
            <li>I ordered this kit as a back-up for the one I already had, and it is exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>cuticle nipper is easy to use with a little practice, it&#x27;s intuitive once you get started.</li>
            <li>It is very sturdy and offers a solid file.</li>
            <li>use these nearly every day</li>
            <li>Use it nearly every day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too early to be writing this review.</li>
            <li>the cuticle clippers are very sharp and the file is a good for a small size.</li>
            <li>Small, compact, nail rescue  kit, Can put in your purse/suitcase for easy use.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Tools are high quality and last.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this, especially for traveling.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a small kit to fit in my purse for &amp;#34;nail</li>
            <li>This small kit is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I have this set in several locations; one in my travel set, one in the car, and one in a drawer near my TV chair (isn&#x27;t that where you always seem to find a &#x27;nail issue&#x27;?)  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t left home in 2 years without one of these, and I&#x27;ll tell you from experience that after frequent use over an extended period of time, this product still works almost as well as the day that I bought it..</li>
            <li>Works extremely well and a super little gift or stocking stuffer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend highly.</li>
            <li>I have a large everyday purse, but this would definitely not take up much space in a smaller one.</li>

            <li> Either way, the tools do what they&#x27;re intended for very well and the kit deserves 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t for the used appearance of the case and clipper sheath.</li>
            <li> -  is a standard metal file and gets the job done for shaping the free edge of my nails.&lt;br /&gt;Pusher -  I like the flat side for smooth cuticle pushing&lt;br</li>
            <li> the tools are about 2 to 2 1/2&amp;#34; long so they are easily packed in a suitcase/travel bag, pocket or purse.</li>
            <li> I love my Tweezerman items but due to the Easter Holidays nobody was around to get the package with the Nyx cosmetics.  </li>
            <li> I found this mini set for about the same price as the full size cutters.</li>
            <li> The little set has some nice tools, but would be complete if it had a nail clipper in it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommended it.</li>

            <li> I needed a new set of cuticle nippers and when I found these tweezer-style ones, I was hooked!  Very sharp and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I lost those ones and when I was searching for new ones online</li>
            <li> New , came in about a week.</li>
            <li> I ordered this kit as a back-up for the one I already had, and it is exactly the same.  </li>

            <li> Tools are high quality and last.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this, especially for traveling.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a small kit to fit in my purse for &amp;#34;nail</li>
            <li> This small kit is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I have this set in several locations; one in my travel set, one in the car, and one in a drawer near my TV chair (isn&#x27;t that where you always seem to find a &#x27;nail issue&#x27;?)  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t left home in 2 years without one of these, and I&#x27;ll tell you from experience that after frequent use over an extended period of time, this product still works almost as well as the day that I bought it..</li>
            <li> Works extremely well and a super little gift or stocking stuffer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend highly.</li>
            <li> I have a large everyday purse, but this would definitely not take up much space in a smaller one.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this the sharp little cuticle nippers drew blood on two out of three fingers.</li>
            <li> It is small but it works very well.  </li>
            <li> The double ended cleaning and cuticle push tool is terrific, but be REALLY careful when you use it to push back your cuticles.</li>
            <li> i couldnt live without these little tools!</li>
            <li> &quot; long, the file is approx.</li>
            <li> The kit is small enough to fit in my small purse, and I use it at least once a week.  </li>
            <li> &quot; long, and the mini pushy and nail cleaner is a little over 3\\&quot; long.  </li>
            <li> Only thing missing from the set is a nail clipper.</li>
            <li> The cuticle nipper is sharp, so be careful, but it&#x27;s the truth!</li>
            <li> so be careful, it works!</li>
            <li> Extremely convenient.</li>
            <li> Amazingly sharp and so compact.  </li>
            <li> The nipper is why I bought this kit, and it is quite well made: sharp and controllable.</li>
            <li> Sharp.</li>
            <li> The perks to ordering on Amazon are that I actually saved a few bucks and didn&#x27;t have to leave Sephora in debt!</li>
            <li> Love tweezerman products I have never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had it for well over a year and the nippers are still sharp.  </li>
            <li> Trimmers are really sharp.</li>
            <li> The cuticle shaper is SHARP!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about half the size of a pack of cigarettes if that helps for scale.</li>
            <li> The quality is up to par of other Tweezerman products, however it is too small for everyday use.</li>
            <li> so it can be addressed before it gets worse and possibly sore or infected</li>
            <li> I destroy my cuticles if I don&#x27;t have a nipper on me.</li>
            <li> Small and very sharp</li>
            <li> I like how small these tools are.</li>
            <li> Over all, i am pretty disappointed</li>
            <li> Tools are small and efficient.  </li>
            <li> The case was a bit scratched up and the cuticle clipper cover has a small tear.</li>
            <li> the file is just now beginning to dull.  </li>
            <li> I tried several times cutting myself</li>
            <li> I do like this size, though, my hands are small- although the file is generally useless to me.</li>
            <li> These tools are clubby and difficult to maneuver.  </li>
            <li> Awkward.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This kit is a great deal. Organized and travel ready. The cuticle nipper is sharp, so be careful, but it&#x27;s the truth! Great buy.</li>
            <li> I love this kit. I carry one in my purse and keep another at my workplace. An essential anyone who does at home manicures.</li>
            <li> The size of this set is convenient for travel and the price is definitely better than purchasing all three separately and full size. I&#x27;m glad I got it but this is truly a travel kit. It would be nice if the nail file was a little longer. The cuticle shaper is SHARP! so be careful, it works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved tweezerman products especially the their cuticle trimmer. so when i saw a travel size rescue kit i had to get it. its compact yet easy to maneuver and easy to carry. i take it every where i go. thanx tweezerman.</li>
            <li> I lost my Tweezerman cuticle trimmer.  It is absolutely the best cuticle trimmer ever made. The tweezer-like style works so much better than the nipper-style if you do your own manicures.  I searched for this model in a physical store, but couldn&#x27;t find one.  I remembered that I had some $ left over on an Amazon gift card I got for Christmas, so I found my coveted Tweezerman cuticle trimmer on Amazon.  Best of all, it came in this compact Nail Rescue Kit, which included a really nice file &amp; cuticle pusher.  Fits great in my purse. Extremely convenient.</li>
            <li> I have had this wonderful kit for a number of months now.  Great nail kit for travel or to keep in your purse.  It is small but it works very well.  Would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The little set has some nice tools, but would be complete if it had a nail clipper in it.  The hangnail and cuticle snipper is approx. 2 3/4\\&quot; long, the file is approx. 3 1/4\\&quot; long, and the mini pushy and nail cleaner is a little over 3\\&quot; long.  I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but it looks to be good quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this kit, considering what I really wanted was a cuticle trimmer and this costs less than the larger tweezerman cuticle trimmer by itself ($22).  They are all great quality, as can be expected from tweezerman.  I love how the little case fits in my purse perfectly!  Happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Handy for the purse and can fix just about every nail/cuticle emergency!</li>
            <li> The quality of this product cannot be beat--all parts are a solid metal and well made.  The kit is small enough to fit in my small purse, and I use it at least once a week.  Because of this kit, I have quit biting my nails (I used to bite them when I found a snag), but now I have no snags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> All the instruments work quite well- the cuticle clippers are very sharp and the file is a good for a small size. Only thing missing from the set is a nail clipper.</li>
            <li> great travel size and Tweezerman quality</li>
            <li> Worth it. Love them. Bought everyone bi know one for Christmas</li>
            <li> This was a perfect little kit to carry in your purse for that nail emergency. I&#x27;ve used it several times and I&#x27;m really glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Nice sharp hangnail clipper and file.  I am enjoying it very much for the convenience to have ha nail clipper with me at all times.  I highly recommended it.</li>
            <li> I have brittle nails and these are great for on the go care for hangnails. Fits in the palm of your hand, and Tweezerman has a great guarantee on keeping their items sharp.</li>
            <li> Tools very nice, work as described.  File will provide lots of use and the nippers are great for cuticles and hangnails.</li>
            <li> perfect for a woman&#x27;s purse especially good for those hang nails or broken nail so it can be addressed before it gets worse and possibly sore or infected</li>
            <li> I like how small these tools are. I have large hands, but can still use these well. I bought this set because the cuticle trimmer was the style I like. It gives a good tactile response and feedback so that you don&#x27;t cut too deep.</li>
            <li> It should mostly be used for travel and just being really portable.  The quality is up to par of other Tweezerman products, however it is too small for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a small kit to fit in my purse for &amp;#34;nail rescue.&amp;#34;  This little kit is perfect.  It comes in a handy plastic case, which is perfect and the tools are high quality.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Really nice set in a great hard case. This set is the perfect  size for purse or travel but the quality is so good I use it at home too. Nippers - are sharp and work great for cuticles and hang nails.&lt;br /&gt;File -  is a standard metal file and gets the job done for shaping the free edge of my nails.&lt;br /&gt;Pusher -  I like the flat side for smooth cuticle pushing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this kit weekly but actually bought it for travel. I might need a backup set for my travel bag. I wish each implement were about 3/4 of an inch longer for comfort but overall it&#x27;s a great quality kit.</li>
            <li> TWEEZERMAN Nail  Rescue Kit is the perfect  product to carry  in your handbag, for those nail emergencies(broken nail, hang nail,etc.). The cuticle pusher and cleaner, nail file are well made products, because they are made by TWEEZERMAN a wonderful name in the  field. The carry case is  the perfect small size. Just love it all-the product, the price and the quick delivery Thank you!!!!</li>
            <li> i am very happy with this purchase. i particularly love the cuticle nipper, works great. the small size fits perfectly in a purse</li>
            <li> Small, compact, nail rescue  kit, Can put in your purse/suitcase for easy use.&lt;br /&gt; Excellent gifts for female family member.&lt;br /&gt; A+++++ Product</li>
            <li> perfect for an at home manicurist like myself. i couldnt live without these little tools! i bring them everywhere with me</li>
            <li> This small kit is fantastic.  It stops me from pulling off a nail or ripping a cuticle.  Amazingly sharp and so compact.  Love it!  I gave it as gifts for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I love tweezerman products &amp; this is no exception. Great case to just throw in your purse for emergencies. Came on time &amp; quality as always.</li>
            <li> Perfect size to slip in your purse and go! I use it every day and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for your purse, all tools are high quality, would highly recommend- I use the nippers all the time for hangnails</li>
            <li> I have purchased a pair of the tweezerman cuticle cutters in the style that comes in this set before and I loved them. I lost those ones and when I was searching for new ones online I found this mini set for about the same price as the full size cutters. I have to say that I think it is just perfect and the quality of tweezerman prodcuts makes this set invaluable. You can use it all the time and not worry about much wear and tear. The nail file is amazing! It is very sturdy and offers a solid file. One of the best nail filers I have ever used. The double ended cuticle pusher and cleaner is a nice tool as well, I feel like Im at the salon when I use it. Overall This is an awesome buy, all really great quality tools and at a great price!</li>
            <li> I destroy my cuticles if I don&#x27;t have a nipper on me. The file and pusher are just a bonus in my opinion. I have a large everyday purse, but this would definitely not take up much space in a smaller one. It&#x27;s about half the size of a pack of cigarettes if that helps for scale. This nipper is a lot better quality than my old travel one, I don&#x27;t see it breaking from extended use.</li>
            <li> The file is good, but the length limits its usefulness compared to full-size tools. The cuticle pusher is solid, smooth, and gets the job done. The nipper is why I bought this kit, and it is quite well made: sharp and controllable.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this the sharp little cuticle nippers drew blood on two out of three fingers. Then I had the brilliant idea that I probably should soak first. Hasn&#x27;t happened again. I believe that&#x27;s called user error.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use these nearly every day so I&#x27;m probably going to purchase the full-sized ones as well. I do like this size, though, my hands are small- although the file is generally useless to me. Great for pedicures as well.</li>
            <li> This product was awesome, I ordered it and two months later i still have not received it.  Happy new year and I hope someone is enjoying my Tweezerman Nail rescue Kit.  Over all, i am pretty disappointed</li>
            <li> Super useful. Sharp. Sailed through TSA. Use it nearly every day. Lifesaver for my nails. It&#x27;s too early to be writing this review.</li>
            <li> I needed a new set of cuticle nippers and when I found these tweezer-style ones, I was hooked!  Very sharp and easy to use.  I love the stainless cuticle pusher too, and the fact that it comes in a little case that fits in my purse - perfect.  You just have to make sure that the file is in the middle when you put the lid on, or it doesn&#x27;t want to close all the way.  Easy.</li>
            <li> I have this set in several locations; one in my travel set, one in the car, and one in a drawer near my TV chair (isn&#x27;t that where you always seem to find a &#x27;nail issue&#x27;?)  Don&#x27;t use the &#x27;pusher&#x27; but the file and trimmer are perfect and very good.</li>
            <li> These tools are clubby and difficult to maneuver.  No, I would not buy again.  Awkward.  I would have returned but never got around to it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a Christmas gift. . . I own the set and I use it every day.  Tweezerman products are superb. .as was the Amazon price.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this product but immediately knew it wasn&#x27;t for me. Small and very sharp I tried several times cutting myself so I decided it was better for someone with pretty good experience and that isn;t e!</li>
            <li> SIZED TO FIT A COSMETIC BAG TO BE CARRIED IN A POCKETBOOK. PETITE,JUST RIGHT OR FIXING THAT SNAGGED NAIL, HANGNAIL AND FOR A QUICK CLEAN UNDER THE NAIL. LIKE THE CARRYING CASE - KEEPS ALL TOGETHER TOUCH ONE GET THEM ALL. GOOD MIX - GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I ordered this kit as a back-up for the one I already had, and it is exactly the same.  I haven&#x27;t left home in 2 years without one of these, and I&#x27;ll tell you from experience that after frequent use over an extended period of time, this product still works almost as well as the day that I bought it.. the file is just now beginning to dull.  The perks to ordering on Amazon are that I actually saved a few bucks and didn&#x27;t have to leave Sephora in debt! HAHA! Every girl needs one of these!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter, who travels a fair bit and has to keep her stuff portable and organized.  These are excellent quality tweezers, fit nicely in their integral carrying case, and are a good size for female hands/fingers.  Oh, and if you get a set for your daughter, expect your wife to want some, too.</li>
            <li> This is only good for an emergency traveling kit.</li>
            <li> Love tweezerman products I have never been disappointed. This little nail rescue kit is AWESOME. I use it all the time. It is great for hang nails.</li>
            <li> Very nice little kit.  I like that it has a sturdy case to protect the tools.  We&#x27;ve had it for well over a year and the nippers are still sharp.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The high quality little kit has made me very happy and prevented trips to the nail salon.</li>
            <li> Excellent - Item delivered on time, was as described, great customer service</li>
            <li> this is an awesome compact tweezer kit, I love it and it fits in my purse well, excellent buy for the money.</li>
            <li> I have had this kit for over a  year and it goes with me everywhere and everday.  I just bought a bunch for stocking stuffers and for friends.  Tools are high quality and last.</li>
            <li> great little kit.Works extremely well and a super little gift or stocking stuffer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend highly.</li>
            <li> Love it and recommended</li>
            <li> I love my Tweezerman items but due to the Easter Holidays nobody was around to get the package with the Nyx cosmetics.  I hope it will be refunded!</li>
            <li> This tweezer set is most functional.  It came with just the right pieces and the case is a very nice touch.  I highly recommend this, especially for traveling.</li>
            <li> Tools are small and efficient.  Great for home use, to throw in your purse and travel.</li>
            <li> The tools work perfectly. They are mini versions but fit comfortably in my hand. Only problems I have are the case and the cuticle clipper cover. The case was a bit scratched up and the cuticle clipper cover has a small tear. It almost seems as if the kit is used. Either way, the tools do what they&#x27;re intended for very well and the kit deserves 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t for the used appearance of the case and clipper sheath.</li>
            <li> New , came in about a week. I love this item so much that I ordered two more. Must have for doing nails. One for desk , for purse , for bathroom. Trimmers are really sharp.</li>
            <li> I love the way these three pieces fit perfectly within the case. The double ended cleaning and cuticle push tool is terrific, but be REALLY careful when you use it to push back your cuticles. Because it&#x27;s metal, there&#x27;s a tendency to scrap your nail itself which can result in peeling.&lt;br /&gt;The cuticle nipper is easy to use with a little practice, it&#x27;s intuitive once you get started. Little nips, not big cuts of cuticle is the best way to use the nipper.&lt;br /&gt;The metal nail file, I haven&#x27;t used because I have many others but I&#x27;m keeping it for emergencies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the tools are about 2 to 2 1/2&amp;#34; long so they are easily packed in a suitcase/travel bag, pocket or purse.</li>
