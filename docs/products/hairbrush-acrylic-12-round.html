            <li>A great hairbrush like we had in the 50&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>Perfect brush for my mom!</li>
            <li>Does not tangle in your hair, gives a great head massage.</li>
            <li>LOL  </li>
            <li>When I found this again I thought I would purchase two and am very happy I did, just love this brush and the style.</li>
            <li>I bought an Avon version in my 30s which I really loved for years</li>
            <li>(I won&#x27;t say how many!).</li>
            <li>NICE BRUSH, IT&#x27;S EASY ON THE SCALP</li>
            <li>it was extremely pleased  to find it on amazon</li>
            <li>The bristles just fold over and skim the top of my hair.  </li>
            <li>Some reviews said the brush went through their hair just fine, and others said they couldn&#x27;t feel the brush, which glided over their hair rather than through</li>
            <li>The size and style of the brush was fine</li>
            <li>got my original from fuller brush sales person</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had one of these exact nylon brushes for many years and it feels just right on my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I have thick hair and it is the best brush I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>I thought I wasn&#x27;t going to enjoy it as much as the Avon brush, but I&#x27;m liking it just fine.</li>
            <li>This brush is not so quick to pull it all out.</li>
            <li>My first hairbrush from  Stanley Company over 50 years&lt;br /&gt;ago</li>
            <li>the first one that I got.</li>
            <li>as well as the first one.  </li>
            <li>The bristle were too short and too &amp;#34;floppy&amp;#34; to grab my (fine) hair for&lt;br /&gt;blower</li>
            <li>(Apparently there is more than one spot to review this exact same brush.)</li>
            <li>just right not too soft guess call it a medium bristle it forms to my hand the way i like it</li>
            <li>The first brush I got when I was 11 years old and</li>
            <li>The bristles are a little harder than I remember but that is not an issue, it works great.</li>
            <li>I will learn to live with it, but it does not do the job very well.  </li>
            <li>Much better than the natural boar bristle brushes - gets down to the scalp.</li>
            <li>however I was expecting the bristles to be more stiff, like the brushes from Stanley that I have used for years.  </li>
            <li>the second I got when I first got married and that was a long time ago</li>
            <li>The plastic might be a little light weight, which means moms can no longer use them as to correct misbehavior.</li>
            <li>This brush is very comfortable in my hand and has the same stiff bristles as the old Avon brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only (type) of hairbrush that my husband wants and has used for a lot of years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 57 years old.</li>
            <li>I looked for years for a durable bristle brush for my now 82 yr old mom.</li>
            <li>I guess the old one will have to truck on a while longer.</li>
            <li>This brush was just what I needed to replace an old Avon brush that the bristles were falling out because I had caught it in a drawer.</li>
            <li>Had one of these when I was young.</li>
            <li>I have an old hairbrush that I&#x27;ve been using about 50 years that is a Stanley brush.  </li>
            <li>but it does not match up to the quality of the old brush.  </li>
            <li>If you have a sensitive scalp, or perhaps a child who fights hair brushing, I would recommend giving this brush a try.</li>
            <li>most defently would recommend this brush little pricey until you concider how long they last</li>
            <li>It would slip out of my grip and finally I had to hold on to the main body of the brush to blow dry my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, kinda thin hair.</li>

            <li> These brushes seem to be near extinct. It&#x27;s the only (type) of hairbrush that my husband wants and has used for a lot of years. Bought 2 just in case.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush about 30 years ago lost it was extremely pleased  to find it on amazon got my original from fuller brush sales person haven&#x27;t seen one forever the bristle just right not too soft guess call it a medium bristle it forms to my hand the way i like it most defently would recommend this brush little pricey until you concider how long they last</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had one of these exact nylon brushes for many years and it feels just right on my fine hair.  The boar bristle brush I had was probably damaging my hair.</li>
            <li> For years I used an Avon Half-Round brush for my thick hair. Somehow I&#x27;ve lost it. And it is no longer made. I can find some on E-bay, but they want exorbitant prices for them. then I found this brush on Amazon. I read through the reviews. (Apparently there is more than one spot to review this exact same brush.) The reviews were confusing to me as I wanted a hair brush that actually goes through my hair to the scalp. Some reviews said the brush went through their hair just fine, and others said they couldn&#x27;t feel the brush, which glided over their hair rather than through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discovered the brush does not work with my hair. My hair is thick, my not nearly as thick as it used to be. I&#x27;m 57 years old. I used it once and put it back into the box. I am very disappointed as it doesn&#x27;t work very well at all. Why is it so hard to find a brush that actually brushes your hair???</li>
            <li> A great hairbrush like we had in the 50&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> I have below shoulder length  layered hair.  My hair is medium thick and long wavy.  This brush has a short handle, approx. 3 1/2 inches.  The bristles are in two lengths, short ones are little less than 1/2 inch and the long are less than 3/4 inch.  The bristles were somewhat from soft to medium firm.  I could not hold this brush firmly while drying my hair.  It would slip out of my grip and finally I had to hold on to the main body of the brush to blow dry my hair.  I am a small person with 6 1/2 inch hands.  I think this brush would work with short hair and only people with smaller hands.</li>
            <li> I looked for years for a durable bristle brush for my now 82 yr old mom. Thankful I found this one. My Mom LOVES it!</li>
            <li> Perfect brush for my mom!</li>
            <li> This is the same brush I purchased years ago from the door-to-door Fuller Brush salesman!  Much better than the natural boar bristle brushes - gets down to the scalp.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed in this brush, as i had been looking for a replacement for my 30 year old acrylic half-round brush for several years. The bristle were too short and too &amp;#34;floppy&amp;#34; to grab my (fine) hair for&lt;br /&gt;blower styling. I guess the old one will have to truck on a while longer.</li>
            <li> This brush was just what I needed to replace an old Avon brush that the bristles were falling out because I had caught it in a drawer. This brush is very comfortable in my hand and has the same stiff bristles as the old Avon brush. I like to brush my hair with it which massages my head also. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for stiff bristles.</li>
            <li> My grandmother had the same brush. I prefer a bristle brush over the plastic ones that look like dog brushes. I have fine, kinda thin hair. This brush is not so quick to pull it all out.</li>
            <li> Had one of these when I was young.</li>
            <li> I have an old hairbrush that I&#x27;ve been using about 50 years that is a Stanley brush.  I have thick hair and it is the best brush I&#x27;ve ever used.  I thought that this brush would be about the same but it does not match up to the quality of the old brush.  The bristles are not as stiff as the old nylon bristle brush.  Does Stanley still make a nylon bristle brush?  If so, how can I get one?</li>
            <li> Purchased this for granddaughter.  She loves it.</li>
            <li> I had a brush like this as a kid, and I think I ordered another in my 20s. I bought an Avon version in my 30s which I really loved for years (I won&#x27;t say how many!). I finally ordered another one from Fuller Brush and the bristles are a lot softer than I remembered. I thought I wasn&#x27;t going to enjoy it as much as the Avon brush, but I&#x27;m liking it just fine. I find that I can even brush my hair with it when my hair is wet. If you have a sensitive scalp, or perhaps a child who fights hair brushing, I would recommend giving this brush a try.</li>
            <li> The size and style of the brush was fine however I was expecting the bristles to be more stiff, like the brushes from Stanley that I have used for years.  The first brush I got when I was 11 years old and the second I got when I first got married and that was a long time ago but both brushes are still being used .  The bristles on the new one are not nearly as stiff as the first 2 which was disappointing to me.</li>
            <li> I have moderately thick hair and was looking for a bristle brush that could penetrate the thickness and brush the loose hair out.  This is not the brush for that.  The bristles just fold over and skim the top of my hair.  I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> NICE BRUSH, IT&#x27;S EASY ON THE SCALP</li>
            <li> I had this style brush as a child and when I found it again several years ago bought it again. Was getting discouraged because I could not find a brush that equaled this one. When I found this again I thought I would purchase two and am very happy I did, just love this brush and the style. The bristles are a little harder than I remember but that is not an issue, it works great. Does not tangle in your hair, gives a great head massage. I really recommend this for anyone to at least give it a try.</li>
            <li> My mother bought hairbrushes like these from the Fuller Brush man as he came door-to-door.  The plastic might be a little light weight, which means moms can no longer use them as to correct misbehavior. LOL  AND!!! they are made in the USA.</li>
            <li> I am sorry to have to tell you this.  My first hairbrush from  Stanley Company over 50 years&lt;br /&gt;ago just now wore out. and this replacement one that was sent to me, pales in comparison&lt;br /&gt;with the first one that I got. The bristles are a lot softer, so when I brush my hair, the bristles&lt;br /&gt;do not reach my scalp, but rather merely glides across the top of my hair.  It does not work&lt;br /&gt;near as well as the first one.  I have very thick hair and it takes a stiff bristle to penetrate my&lt;br /&gt;hair down to the scalp. I will learn to live with it, but it does not do the job very well.  Mary</li>
