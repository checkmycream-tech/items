            <li>I heard that vitamin A is good for the skin and reviewed NOWFOODS vitamin A fish liver oil and ordered it.</li>

            <li>, you can tell the quality is amazing.</li>
            <li>pimples have been kept at bay and this has a nice feel to it.  </li>
            <li>and I was very happy how fast my skin cleared up after using this product.  </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t affect my acne, but it&#x27;s good for my oily skin because it doesn&#x27;t make it more oily.</li>
            <li>and this is by far one of the best toners I have used!!</li>
            <li>I love this toner, besides the fact that is smell nice</li>

            <li>Very good natural toner that I will&lt;br /&gt;buy</li>
            <li>I love all of burt&#x27;s bees products.</li>
            <li>I thought this product was ok.</li>
            <li>so sometimes I need to saturate the cotton ball a bit more.  </li>
            <li>I love this product line.</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>&amp; it&#x27;s all better now.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the shipping, and how the package was shipped.</li>
            <li>I put it on problem areas every day, and I don&#x27;t have problems in those areas any more.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love burts bees products, they rock</li>
            <li>The product itself is not awful, it is just not for me.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this toner.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>This is the best product ever, my face has never been so smooth and clear. . .</li>
            <li>Plus the alcohol is drying which makes me skin more irritated</li>
            <li>This is an awesome toner and doesn&#x27;t dry out my face.  </li>
            <li>For years I jumped from toner to toner trying to find one that worked the best for my dry combination skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>most importantly it works.</li>
            <li>Works good for me without drying out my skin much.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell too strongly.</li>
            <li>I found Paula&#x27;s Choice products and they work fantastic.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s all natural smells good and</li>
            <li>and it leaves your face feeling and looking clean.</li>
            <li>Keeps skin clean without drying it out.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry my face out and it does a great job clearing up acne.</li>
            <li>Not a bad price also.</li>
            <li>good product, makes my skin feel clean, so far I really like it.</li>
            <li>This is my first natural toner and so far I think it is very good.</li>
            <li>I brought this for my daughter and she loves it, she uses this in lieu of the Proactiv Extra Strength Toner and her face is still acne free; so I would say get this over Proactiv, it is cheaper and effective.</li>
            <li>so i try a lot of different face products (all with enough time in between to determine whether the product is helping or hurting my skin), but this toner is Awesome.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes with this product, as I do with most acne treatments.</li>
            <li>This toner reminds me a bit of a favorite astringent from my teenage days, Bonnie Bell 10-0-6, but is lighter and good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I will refer this to anyone who want to keep their sking clean below the surface of the first layer of skin.</li>
            <li>Every time I tried to switch to a more natural alternative, I would eventually break out.</li>
            <li>This product is so useful.  </li>
            <li>I rarely get blemishes when using the toner in my beauty regimen.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling fresh-</li>
            <li>It picks up dirt that the cleanser misses, and my skin always feels so fresh after I use</li>
            <li>Worth the purchase</li>
            <li>I only picked it up at the market because I needed a toner quickly and this was reasonably priced, but have found it works nicely for me.</li>
            <li>It did smell nice and didn&#x27;t dry out my skin</li>
            <li>It does not irritate my eyes or my face, It is very gentle.</li>
            <li>particular product caused those breakouts to flare into full acne...</li>
            <li>i love the clean smell and it heals current acne fast and helps keep new breakouts to a minimum.&lt;br /&gt;i will be purchasing this prduct again and again.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Burt&#x27;s Bees!!</li>
            <li>If you travel with it, transfer it to another container first.</li>
            <li>Smells nicer than acne free - so far works the same as that or Zenmed or proactive toners with a better smell.</li>
            <li>and I live in a very hot environment (90+).</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product but it leaves a funny feeling film on my face.</li>
            <li>this is a good natural alternative to other face toners if u care about that sort of thing.</li>
            <li>So it really all depends on your skin type.</li>
            <li>You can absolutely smell the tea tree oil</li>
            <li>Removes leftover makeup and really helps prevent breakouts, I&#x27;ve been using it as part of my night time routine and really notice a difference.</li>
            <li>so it dries fast</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I skip the cleanser and go straight to using the toner and lotion.</li>
            <li>One bottle lasts about two months with twice daily use, as you don&#x27;t need a large amount to fully clean your face and neck with each application.</li>
            <li>and when I first started using this toner, it made my skin super dry yet sticky.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just a regular facial product, nothing magical if you have hormonal acne.</li>
            <li>I highly, highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes that that would solve the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I feel it is a lot more natural alternative to Pro Active.</li>
            <li>My skin was left glowing and feeling soo clean and soft.</li>
            <li>This toner is very purifying so far</li>
            <li>I purchased this after seeing all of the great reviews and wanted something less drying and harsh for my oily, acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li>this definitely works and I saw results right away with using.</li>
            <li>My teen&#x27;s skin cleared up right away</li>
            <li>For moisturizer I currently use aveeno positively radiant which I don&#x27;t really like</li>
            <li>and my skin has never been this clear!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had clear skin like this in about a year, and I&#x27;m 24!</li>
            <li>only downside is that the bottle tends to open whenever I travel, and more than once I&#x27;ve had an entire bottle leak in my suitcase.</li>
            <li>but since this is mostly natural and Burt&#x27;s Bees I expect this.  </li>
            <li>Soft but not overpowering smell.</li>
            <li>I like that this toner is all natural and could be used on her young skin without any irritations.</li>
            <li>the moisture isn&#x27;t needed in all areas but this dries it out so much that if I don&#x27;t use moisturizer, my face gets red and irritated.</li>
            <li>I use this in conjunction with the Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Acne Solutions Purifying Gel Cleanser.</li>
            <li>The toner was worth the money spent, and the time I used to order it.</li>
            <li>I recently switched my face routine to all natural products and this toner is way better than the Neutrogena one I used in the past.</li>
            <li>I used this a couple times and it really irritates my skin, which is strange because I use the face was that goes with it.</li>
            <li>My skin is a combination of dry and oily, and is very acne-prone.</li>
            <li>my teen son will actually use this (instead of skipping cleaning his face) and it really works.  </li>
            <li>I always have at least one on back up to make sure I never run out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But for me, even after like 3 weeks of using it, I would still get major breakouts.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s gentle enough to not dry you out but still has enough Salicylic Acid to keep breakouts under control.</li>
            <li>I only saw slight improvements and I still have some mild acne and dis-coloring</li>
            <li>I generally don&#x27;t moisturize as my face is combination and</li>
            <li>I have been using the scrub with this toner, daily, for over a month and my skin is completely clear.</li>
            <li>I heard from other reviews claiming that using too much product will cause this.</li>
            <li>Does NOT dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, dry, acne-prone skin and this toner</li>
            <li>It also helps clear up minor breakouts.  </li>
            <li>And I know when you start a new product you have never used before you do go through a rough patch where your skin has to get used to it.</li>
            <li>(I then fold it in half and on the outside, I dribble a tiny amount of water to dilute and spread the mixture in the pad, squeezing any excess water out and rub it around my face), and finally, I finish with the Burt&#x27;s Bees intense day</li>
            <li>A littler pricier than some other brands, but I buy because this is not tested on live animals.</li>

            <li> My skin was left glowing and feeling soo clean and soft.</li>
            <li> This toner is very purifying so far</li>
            <li> I purchased this after seeing all of the great reviews and wanted something less drying and harsh for my oily, acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li> this definitely works and I saw results right away with using.</li>
            <li> My teen&#x27;s skin cleared up right away</li>
            <li> For moisturizer I currently use aveeno positively radiant which I don&#x27;t really like</li>
            <li> and my skin has never been this clear!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had clear skin like this in about a year, and I&#x27;m 24!</li>
            <li> only downside is that the bottle tends to open whenever I travel, and more than once I&#x27;ve had an entire bottle leak in my suitcase.</li>
            <li> but since this is mostly natural and Burt&#x27;s Bees I expect this.  </li>
            <li> Soft but not overpowering smell.</li>
            <li> I like that this toner is all natural and could be used on her young skin without any irritations.</li>
            <li> the moisture isn&#x27;t needed in all areas but this dries it out so much that if I don&#x27;t use moisturizer, my face gets red and irritated.</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with the Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Acne Solutions Purifying Gel Cleanser.</li>
            <li> The toner was worth the money spent, and the time I used to order it.</li>
            <li> I recently switched my face routine to all natural products and this toner is way better than the Neutrogena one I used in the past.</li>
            <li> I used this a couple times and it really irritates my skin, which is strange because I use the face was that goes with it.</li>
            <li> My skin is a combination of dry and oily, and is very acne-prone.</li>
            <li> my teen son will actually use this (instead of skipping cleaning his face) and it really works.  </li>
            <li> I always have at least one on back up to make sure I never run out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But for me, even after like 3 weeks of using it, I would still get major breakouts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s gentle enough to not dry you out but still has enough Salicylic Acid to keep breakouts under control.</li>
            <li> I only saw slight improvements and I still have some mild acne and dis-coloring</li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t moisturize as my face is combination and</li>
            <li> I have been using the scrub with this toner, daily, for over a month and my skin is completely clear.</li>
            <li> I heard from other reviews claiming that using too much product will cause this.</li>
            <li> Does NOT dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, dry, acne-prone skin and this toner</li>
            <li> It also helps clear up minor breakouts.  </li>
            <li> And I know when you start a new product you have never used before you do go through a rough patch where your skin has to get used to it.</li>
            <li> (I then fold it in half and on the outside, I dribble a tiny amount of water to dilute and spread the mixture in the pad, squeezing any excess water out and rub it around my face), and finally, I finish with the Burt&#x27;s Bees intense day</li>
            <li> A littler pricier than some other brands, but I buy because this is not tested on live animals.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 40&#x27;s and only had luck with Pro Active system for keeping me from breaking out.</li>
            <li> But after the small initial breakout that I had once I started the scrub and this toner, the acne quickly went away and all I&#x27;m left with now are a few acne scars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this product already long enough</li>
            <li> and I seem to have broken out a little more.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees keeps my skin clear and doesn&#x27;t dry it out like other products I have tested.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sounds like a long process but it really only takes me roughly 3 minutes for my daily routine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying this for a long time.</li>
            <li> However, this did not clear up my acne in the slightest.</li>
            <li> There is still alcohol in it (not sure how much) but it is not as much as other toners and has not stung my face.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my back and face, so I wish the bottle was a little bigger, but it works well.  </li>
            <li> On my second bottle; extremely content.</li>
            <li> It does not over dry my oily dry and the alcohol is not overbearing.  </li>
            <li> It does not burn my skin, nor does it dry it out.</li>
            <li> Not to mention, I no longer have dry patches.</li>
            <li> I am used to larger bottles for less</li>
            <li> Not really for me.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read the label carefully.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thin, not impotent, but the texture is watery--so you might waste a bit pouring too much into a cottonball if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> I have terrible skin and this bottle is the only reason I&#x27;m clear right now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands like Neutrogena and it dried out my skin after a few washes.</li>
            <li> My skin is a bit clearer but I am not sure if this is due to BHA treatment I also started along with this toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little disappoint.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s due to the products,</li>
            <li> Be wary, if you have an open blemish, this will sting, but it also helps to dry out the pimple too.</li>
            <li> I bought the complete kit, unfortunately it did not work.</li>
            <li> I got this a few weeks ago</li>
            <li> I used this acne toner everyday 2x a day, after washing my face, until the bottle ran out.</li>
            <li> This only stings for me on broken skin.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a harsh feeling or harsh smelling toner.  </li>
            <li> I started using Burt&#x27;s Bees products a few days ago</li>
            <li> So my routine was updated to using my Yes to Cucumber cleanser, followed by a small amount of toner on a cotton pad</li>
            <li> Sometimes I&#x27;m so lazy</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical to try this as I am when trying any new facial products, just because I hope there isn&#x27;t any type of bad reaction.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 27 and still suffer from hormonal acne which SUCKS.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing was waiting over 15 days to get it.</li>
            <li> The liquid is a bit thin (if that makes sense)</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a week, and it caused me to break out worse than my acne that caused me to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I mean, I don&#x27;t have crazy bad acne, but there&#x27;s always a pimple or zit that will stay for at least a MONTH at a time.</li>
            <li> I am prone to bad breakouts</li>
            <li> and I am in a bad position.</li>
            <li> I had a really bad breakout and this cleared it up within no time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get bad acne, just have always had one to three zits at a time, always.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s my bad</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product. Arrived promptly. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is great &#x27;preventative maintenance&#x27; toner.  Does NOT dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome toner and doesn&#x27;t dry out my face.  Has a tingling and leaves your face feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> I love all of burt&#x27;s bees products. This is great.</li>
            <li> For years I jumped from toner to toner trying to find one that worked the best for my dry combination skin. I never need to try another toner after stumbling upon this product. My skin has never been clearer and I haven&#x27;t had a breakout since I started using it 8 months ago, which has never happened to me before. I use this in the morning and evening after washing my face with a basic face soap and before night/day cream. One bottle lasts about two months with twice daily use, as you don&#x27;t need a large amount to fully clean your face and neck with each application. I highly, highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I thought this product was ok. It did smell nice and didn&#x27;t dry out my skin so that was good. But it did, however, cause me to breakout...a lot!! And I know when you start a new product you have never used before you do go through a rough patch where your skin has to get used to it. But for me, even after like 3 weeks of using it, I would still get major breakouts. So after a month of using this product hoping it would do wonders for me, which it didn&#x27;t, I stopped using it. And the day I stopped my skin actually started getting clearer!! So it really all depends on your skin type.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after seeing all of the great reviews and wanted something less drying and harsh for my oily, acne prone skin.  I am impressed with this toner.  There is still alcohol in it (not sure how much) but it is not as much as other toners and has not stung my face.  You can absolutely smell the tea tree oil but this is not bothersome to me.  I like that it has the salicylic because I used a benzo peroxide cream which is a good combo for my pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A con that causes me to give it 4 stars would be the price for the bottle.  I am used to larger bottles for less but since this is mostly natural and Burt&#x27;s Bees I expect this.  The liquid is a bit thin (if that makes sense) so sometimes I need to saturate the cotton ball a bit more.  My skin is a bit clearer but I am not sure if this is due to BHA treatment I also started along with this toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My pimples have been kept at bay and this has a nice feel to it.  It does not over dry my oily dry and the alcohol is not overbearing.  I see myself buying this again.</li>
            <li> I have used burt Bee&#x27;s products before and have never had a problem. It works well and no issues and would recommend it for all ages.</li>
            <li> This is my first natural toner and so far I think it is very good. I am prone to bad breakouts and I live in a very hot environment (90+). Mix this with combination skin and I am in a bad position. This toner is very purifying so far and I hope it will heal some acne scars i have.</li>
            <li> I used this a couple times and it really irritates my skin, which is strange because I use the face was that goes with it.</li>
            <li> I only used the toner when I had a series of break outs and I was very happy how fast my skin cleared up after using this product.  I love this product line.</li>
            <li> The quality of the product is not bad,but after I began to use, I found the  expiration date is August 2014.As you know ,I bought it on May 2014. Without any bonus or discount, I bought the goods that will up to the date out of the using. A little disappoint.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 40&#x27;s and only had luck with Pro Active system for keeping me from breaking out. Every time I tried to switch to a more natural alternative, I would eventually break out. I use Alba Botanica face scrub, this acne clarifying toner and Burts Bees moisturizer. Works great and I feel it is a lot more natural alternative to Pro Active.</li>
            <li> Love this toner! Great for breakouts.</li>
            <li> These ingredients containing in this products did not go to my skin. I bought the complete kit, unfortunately it did not work.</li>
            <li> I love this product it&#x27;s just amazing. and it leaves your face feeling and looking clean. I Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Removes leftover makeup and really helps prevent breakouts, I&#x27;ve been using it as part of my night time routine and really notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I got this a few weeks ago and I&#x27;ve been using it every day and my skin has never been this clear! I have terrible skin and this bottle is the only reason I&#x27;m clear right now. I love it! I have oily skin and lots of problem areas &amp; it&#x27;s all better now.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the shipping, and how the package was shipped. The toner was worth the money spent, and the time I used to order it. Works good for me without drying out my skin much. I will refer this to anyone who want to keep their sking clean below the surface of the first layer of skin.</li>
            <li> Gentile, yet effective!</li>
            <li> This toner cools my face and keeps the oil and pimples away. Very good natural toner that I will&lt;br /&gt;buy again. Not a bad price also.</li>
            <li> This product is so useful.  I put it on problem areas every day, and I don&#x27;t have problems in those areas any more.  It&#x27;s liquid so it dries fast and I can put creams or serums over it.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I used this acne toner everyday 2x a day, after washing my face, until the bottle ran out. I only saw slight improvements and I still have some mild acne and dis-coloring</li>
            <li> I think this product gave me severe headaches . It did an alright job. Would not buy again. Too pricey.</li>
            <li> Love this toner! I recently switched my face routine to all natural products and this toner is way better than the Neutrogena one I used in the past. It&#x27;s very light and goes on smoothly. I use a cotton ball to apply this product. This toner helps even out my skin and prepares my face. Be wary, if you have an open blemish, this will sting, but it also helps to dry out the pimple too. The only problem is that I could through this stuff faster than the moisturizer or the cleansers, so I&#x27;ve already had to order another bottle. Would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> good product, makes my skin feel clean, so far I really like it. I love burts bees products, they rock</li>
            <li> The product itself is not awful, it is just not for me. I have been using it for about a week, and it caused me to break out worse than my acne that caused me to buy this product. Did not work for my skin..</li>
            <li> Only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is bc this is my second day using it. I&#x27;m 27 and still suffer from hormonal acne which SUCKS. I&#x27;ve suffered from acne from age 13 and I figured it&#x27;d go away. I heard that vitamin A is good for the skin and reviewed NOWFOODS vitamin A fish liver oil and ordered it. Hopefully it works. In addition to buying this toner I bought cerave foaming cleanser and together, these two works well. For moisturizer I currently use aveeno positively radiant which I don&#x27;t really like so I&#x27;m going to research a good one for my oily skin. Hope this helps</li>
            <li> Love it. Use it morning and night before I moisturize. I rarely get blemishes when using the toner in my beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> this is a good natural alternative to other face toners if u care about that sort of thing. If not it is still a good inexpensive toner that works.</li>
            <li> This toner smells great and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.  It leaves my face feeling fresh- I use it every night before bed.  Soft but not overpowering smell.</li>
            <li> Great product. It picks up dirt that the cleanser misses, and my skin always feels so fresh after I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that the bottle tends to open whenever I travel, and more than once I&#x27;ve had an entire bottle leak in my suitcase. If you travel with it, transfer it to another container first.</li>
            <li> Really good product. Very light scent and removes all the impurities from my face and neck. It does not irritate my eyes or my face, It is very gentle. My face had improved a lot since I suffer from acne.</li>
            <li> I love this toner. It&#x27;s a little thin, not impotent, but the texture is watery--so you might waste a bit pouring too much into a cottonball if you&#x27;re not careful. This only stings for me on broken skin. Doesn&#x27;t smell too strongly.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a harsh feeling or harsh smelling toner.  I use it on my back and face, so I wish the bottle was a little bigger, but it works well.  I can get makeup off using it after I wash my face.</li>
            <li> This toner reminds me a bit of a favorite astringent from my teenage days, Bonnie Bell 10-0-6, but is lighter and good for sensitive skin. I only picked it up at the market because I needed a toner quickly and this was reasonably priced, but have found it works nicely for me. It seems to keep redness at bay and removes all remaining traces of makeup after cleansing. It also helps clear up minor breakouts.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this toner for my pre-teen daughter who started having problems with her skin. I like that this toner is all natural and could be used on her young skin without any irritations.</li>
            <li> Worth the purchase and it doesn&#x27;t smell medicinal.</li>
            <li> great stuff. my teen son will actually use this (instead of skipping cleaning his face) and it really works.  He likes the way it feels and smells.  And we can all see the effects.  This is the best place to get this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this product already long enough but it doesn&#x27;t affect my acne, but it&#x27;s good for my oily skin because it doesn&#x27;t make it more oily. it&#x27;s just a regular facial product, nothing magical if you have hormonal acne.</li>
            <li> I brought this for my daughter and she loves it, she uses this in lieu of the Proactiv Extra Strength Toner and her face is still acne free; so I would say get this over Proactiv, it is cheaper and effective.</li>
            <li> Not really for me. My skin didn&#x27;t look or feel any different after use. I found Paula&#x27;s Choice products and they work fantastic.</li>
            <li> Smells nicer than acne free - so far works the same as that or Zenmed or proactive toners with a better smell.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product but it leaves a funny feeling film on my face. I don&#x27;t care for it, nor have I noticed an improvement in my acne.</li>
            <li> Great product. Keeps skin clean without drying it out.</li>
            <li> this definitely works and I saw results right away with using. I had a really bad breakout and this cleared it up within no time.</li>
            <li> The product is very good for my skin. It doesn&#x27;t dry my face out and it does a great job clearing up acne. The only bad thing was waiting over 15 days to get it.</li>
            <li> I wrote a review on the Burt&#x27;s Bees Acne Solutions Pore Refining Scrub, which also mentioned this toner. I have been using the scrub with this toner, daily, for over a month and my skin is completely clear. I haven&#x27;t had clear skin like this in about a year, and I&#x27;m 24! I don&#x27;t get bad acne, just have always had one to three zits at a time, always. My skin is a combination of dry and oily, and is very acne-prone. I was a little skeptical to try this as I am when trying any new facial products, just because I hope there isn&#x27;t any type of bad reaction. But after the small initial breakout that I had once I started the scrub and this toner, the acne quickly went away and all I&#x27;m left with now are a few acne scars. I use this toner with a cotton ball, rub it all over my face and on my neck. I love the smell. It does not burn my skin, nor does it dry it out. If you&#x27;re thinking about trying this, just go for it! It&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> so i try a lot of different face products (all with enough time in between to determine whether the product is helping or hurting my skin), but this toner is Awesome.  i love the clean smell and it heals current acne fast and helps keep new breakouts to a minimum.&lt;br /&gt;i will be purchasing this prduct again and again.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Burt&#x27;s Bees!!</li>
            <li> Good salicylic acid toner for break-outs.  A littler pricier than some other brands, but I buy because this is not tested on live animals.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff it&#x27;s all natural smells good and most importantly it works. But I won&#x27;t be ordering online again because of the price and time. I can get this item at the store for the same price as ordering online and it will take me no time to go to the store and pick it up</li>
            <li> This is an excellent toner. I have oily/sensitive skin and this is by far one of the best toners I have used!!</li>
            <li> This is the best product ever, my face has never been so smooth and clear. . . I&#x27;ll be buying this for a long time.</li>
            <li> Love it! I have very sensitive, dry, acne-prone skin and this toner is everything I need. On my second bottle; extremely content.</li>
            <li> BUY THIS. I purchased mine at Target for $9.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry/combo skin to begin with and when I first started using this toner, it made my skin super dry yet sticky. I didn&#x27;t know that was even possible. I heard from other reviews claiming that using too much product will cause this. So my routine was updated to using my Yes to Cucumber cleanser, followed by a small amount of toner on a cotton pad (I then fold it in half and on the outside, I dribble a tiny amount of water to dilute and spread the mixture in the pad, squeezing any excess water out and rub it around my face), and finally, I finish with the Burt&#x27;s Bees intense day lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sounds like a long process but it really only takes me roughly 3 minutes for my daily routine. Sometimes I&#x27;m so lazy I skip the cleanser and go straight to using the toner and lotion. Using only 2 tiny cotton pads of this product is enough to take all my makeup off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and by the way, all of my acne disappeared within about 1-2 weeks and I&#x27;ve been acne-free since then. I mean, I don&#x27;t have crazy bad acne, but there&#x27;s always a pimple or zit that will stay for at least a MONTH at a time. Who does that?! Not to mention, I no longer have dry patches. I can&#x27;t recommend this toner with the lotion enough. It&#x27;s feels so amazing that I don&#x27;t have acne anymore. Also, a side note: if you&#x27;re one of those people that tend to pick or touch your face only to have those spots turn to acne, just rub some of this on there and voila! It cleans your pores and no pimple will appear tomorrow.</li>
            <li> I started using Burt&#x27;s Bees products a few days ago and I seem to have broken out a little more. Not sure if it&#x27;s due to the products, but I&#x27;m going to keep using it to see if it improves.</li>
            <li> This product seems to work but it&#x27;s my bad I didn&#x27;t read the label carefully. The second ingredient is alcohol and it makes me cough while applying the toner to my face which is a total bummer. Plus the alcohol is drying which makes me skin more irritated so I have to use a moisturizer. I generally don&#x27;t moisturize as my face is combination and the moisture isn&#x27;t needed in all areas but this dries it out so much that if I don&#x27;t use moisturizer, my face gets red and irritated. I likely will continue my search for another toner.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes with this product, as I do with most acne treatments. However, this did not clear up my acne in the slightest.</li>
            <li> I have some &amp;#34;winter cap&amp;#34; breakout on my forehead.  This year, I decided to use an acne product in those areas instead of a full-face moisturizer/SPF product before my morning walk.  I had high hopes that that would solve the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular product caused those breakouts to flare into full acne...something that&#x27;s never happened before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I use the toner every night before I go to bed. I&#x27;ve tried other brands like Neutrogena and it dried out my skin after a few washes. Burt&#x27;s Bees keeps my skin clear and doesn&#x27;t dry it out like other products I have tested. I always have at least one on back up to make sure I never run out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s gentle enough to not dry you out but still has enough Salicylic Acid to keep breakouts under control. I use this in conjunction with the Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Acne Solutions Purifying Gel Cleanser. Cleanser every morning in the shower and toner at night. Haven&#x27;t had a breakout (unless I forget to use it!)</li>
            <li> Made no difference. Try something else!</li>
            <li> Burts Bee&#x27;s yet again did awesome. I love this toner, besides the fact that is smell nice, you can tell the quality is amazing. My skin was left glowing and feeling soo clean and soft. It&#x27;s perfect for teens too! My teen&#x27;s skin cleared up right away</li>
