            <li>so it&#x27;s even better!</li>
            <li>this is a good item as it works great for letting you see how your earrings look on a person or hats even scarfs ..packaging was nice as it was wrapped in plastic and shipped quick..</li>
            <li>I plan on decoupaging with nice tissue paper or fabric.</li>
            <li>but that is my own mistake not the sellers.</li>
            <li>These are nice...</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my wife who has just starting making crochet hats, they look impressive on it.  </li>
            <li>Love being able to take better pictures of my knitted work.</li>

            <li>it ended so hilariously that I can not but give this product 5 stars.</li>
            <li>and I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Arrived in good shape and was the right height.</li>
            <li>I have had this head for 6 months and it is keeping up pretty good.</li>
            <li>This arrived early and was great for fitting my Halloween wig.</li>
            <li>I love the cutesy shape of her face and she stands up just fine.</li>
            <li>Other than this they were perfect!</li>
            <li>They are lightweight and travel easily.</li>
            <li>I believe it would break easily under stress situations - not my case, though.</li>
            <li>the wig heads were fine and just what I needed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>Amazon rating system thought this was a toy, so the star system doesn&#x27;t really fit.    </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so happy I finally bought them</li>
            <li>Material is cheap grade foam.</li>
            <li>but, NO BASE to them.  </li>
            <li>Material is cheap grade foam.</li>
            <li>These heads are fantastic.</li>
            <li>Came early and in good condition.</li>
            <li>You can get these much cheaper in bulk if you&#x27;re willing to wait longer, but if you need just one, this is a good</li>
            <li>I received the styrofoam head and am excited to make a Christmas tree into a lady.  </li>
            <li>, as usual you are the greatest.</li>
            <li>Originally used it to display head bands.</li>
            <li>This would be good for kids, if they want to play dress up and have their own little wigs.  </li>
            <li>use!&lt;br /&gt;They are not expensive -- they aren&#x27;t going to win you any awards or be of use to you if you need a higher level of professional looking model head.</li>
            <li>It looked good sitting next to me on the plane and in restaurants and for that I\\&quot;ll give it two stars, otherwise I do not recommend it.</li>
            <li>The only reason that matters is when I use the head to model hats, it don&#x27;t look good in the pictures when there is chunks out of it.</li>
            <li>For whatever reason I thought the head would be more the size of a real person</li>
            <li>and I got it quickly.</li>
            <li>Adequate for my needs.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly as pictured and detailed.</li>
            <li>Heads were just what I wanted, great price, but shipping a little steep though.</li>
            <li>Nice standard styrofoam head for wigmaking</li>
            <li>They are fun addition to her dress up wardrobe area.</li>
            <li>This head is much smaller than my own by quite a bit but still works well.</li>
            <li>The item shipped quickly and was exactly as it was pictured.  </li>
            <li>and Im telling with went through some small but hectic situations lol</li>
            <li>The product is exactly what they said it would be</li>
            <li>Fast shipping to Alaska!</li>
            <li>Just make sure that you store them properly.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t have been happier and this is exactly what I looked for in a Wig Stand.  </li>
            <li>&quot; so I couldn&#x27;t use it to make a proper fitting wig.</li>
            <li>(spray painted first of course).</li>
            <li>It arrived in a few days in good condition and I don&#x27;t have any complaints.</li>
            <li>Now, I will be using this purely as a wig stand, I don&#x27;t need it to keep its shape, just to hold it.</li>
            <li>all was fine, ordered several things that day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if stored improperly they could easily be crushed.</li>
            <li>The nose is squished in and it is very noticeable.</li>
            <li>I will say that it was packaged very well</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon</li>
            <li>Very well priced.</li>
            <li>really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A bit smaller than a regular female head but greatly fits its purpose in displaying crochet beanies.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that has a very feminine face sculpted.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a side note, this is very buoyant if the ship capsizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slightly smaller than a real human head, but it stands well and shows off the hats nicely.</li>
            <li>but this head seemed to work well as long as u fit the cap on my head and mark it</li>
            <li>Still works for what I need but not as small as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>I put them in a cupboard high up and out of the way.</li>
            <li>Cute little head.  </li>
            <li>I looked online, and found that Sally Beauty Supply had the exact same thing for $3.</li>
            <li>Literally, the exact same thing.</li>
            <li>but I cover it up anyway, female face and exactly like the picture shown.</li>
            <li>buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just buy it with the knowledge that it&#x27;s on the small side - maybe more tween-sized than adult sized.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, despite the multiple large gashes in the head, I can still use it for that.</li>
            <li>I would like for the packaging to be a little bit better next time</li>
            <li>The item has clearly been used.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s worked</li>
            <li>As a side note, this is very buoyant if the ship capsizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wig Cap (One-Size)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adult Blonde Johnny Costume Wig</li>
            <li>Every easy to move around, small enough to fit just about anywhere, and last a long time.</li>
            <li>Very small, They said they were 12 inches tall, were 9&amp;#34;inches tall at most</li>
            <li>It also shipped quickly and arrived in less than a week.</li>
            <li>I am actually using a long plastic cup placed upside down as a temporary solution till I find something better.</li>
            <li>The size of the head is a little smaller than my head, so the hats look a little looser on it than when I wear them, but it&#x27;s still a good enough size to show the detail of the pattern.</li>
            <li>B000AO5A1U Wig Cap (One-Size)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001B8SKNY Adult Blonde Johnny Costume Wig]]</li>
            <li>only complaint is that it dents easily.</li>
            <li>and I figured it was worth a few extra dollars to have it when I needed it.</li>
            <li>Packers need to be more careful when placing this next to hard surfaces--add some padding.  </li>

            <li> Every easy to move around, small enough to fit just about anywhere, and last a long time.</li>
            <li> Very small, They said they were 12 inches tall, were 9&amp;#34;inches tall at most</li>
            <li> It also shipped quickly and arrived in less than a week.</li>
            <li> I am actually using a long plastic cup placed upside down as a temporary solution till I find something better.</li>
            <li> The size of the head is a little smaller than my head, so the hats look a little looser on it than when I wear them, but it&#x27;s still a good enough size to show the detail of the pattern.</li>

            <li> only complaint is that it dents easily.</li>
            <li> and I figured it was worth a few extra dollars to have it when I needed it.</li>
            <li> Packers need to be more careful when placing this next to hard surfaces--add some padding.  </li>
            <li> I understand the item is styrofoam, and I expected a few imperfections, but I got more than a *few</li>
            <li> Other than running slightly small than I expected, they are working out fine.</li>
            <li> It small and does not resemble the size of a real size human head</li>
            <li> I wish they were less expensive, I would buy a lot more.  </li>
            <li> The head that I received was not exactly as pictured (actually looks like this: http://www.amazon.com/Beautys-Bin-4884-Foam-Mannequin/dp/B005FFQJXC/ref&#x3D;pd_sbs_bt_5 ).</li>
            <li> However, the head practically refused to say a single word throughout the trip.</li>
            <li> If you do not have a BIG ROUND HEAD OR want your wig stretched</li>
            <li> They have the one in the picture, for the same price or less.</li>
            <li> I was expecting something a little bigger.</li>
            <li> It arrived slightly crushed</li>
            <li> big and round</li>
            <li> I find that neither wig fits firmly on the head, the head runs just a bit smaller than I had anticipated.</li>
            <li> Yes the base is great for clamping down if you desire to do a hairstyle, but the head itself is sooo small even if you pinned the wig to the head</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a lot smaller than my usual styrofoam heads.</li>
            <li> But other than that, it works well.</li>
            <li> Not suitable for wigs because it is not a true reperesentation of a human head, unless you&#x27;re an alien of some sort with a tiny head, don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this item on the other hand you could do as I did which created a mess all over the floor.</li>
            <li> I had to use my knife and cut them down to size</li>
            <li> Other than that, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Not worth the $$$, unless you are looking for child size heads!</li>
            <li> Big round headed wig stands!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dropped it a few times, and there&#x27;s all kinds of marks on it.</li>
            <li> Not great as being sturdy, but serves it&#x27;s purpose at a low price</li>
            <li> Had a few bumps and scratches</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not very heavy and the base is not big.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother with this, its too small for wigs.....</li>
            <li> the head is a small size ladies head..</li>
            <li> I mean, it&#x27;s a foam head.</li>
            <li> It is so lightweight that it falls over when I put a hat on it (unless it&#x27;s a very small one) .</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with my purchase because these foam heads were the size of a child&#x27;s head, not an adult.  </li>
            <li> so when I try to use it to make a u part wig it makes it a little difficult.  </li>
            <li> My job requires me to make wigs, and my sister was getting sick of me using her head for that purpose, so I decided to buy an actual wig head.</li>
            <li> All conversation between us was very forced and one sided.</li>
            <li> they had a BIGGER BASE...!</li>
            <li> I added fake eyelashes - she&#x27;s a doll!</li>
            <li> Needless to say, it worked out well!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dirty!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very small, They said they were 12 inches tall, were 9&amp;#34;inches tall at most</li>
            <li> Perfect for my needs!</li>
            <li> I ordered this foam head to use for making my wedding veil.  A Styrofoam head is just that... if u need oneed one then this is does the job.  With shipping it is more expensive than the ones at my local costume store, but they were currently out of them and I figured it was worth a few extra dollars to have it when I needed it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother with this, its too small for wigs.....I was expecting something a little bigger. This would be good for kids, if they want to play dress up and have their own little wigs.  Other than that, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for Halloween decorations and they are awesome!</li>
            <li> Amazon rating system thought this was a toy, so the star system doesn&#x27;t really fit.    Heads were just what I wanted, great price, but shipping a little steep though. Bought 4 heads, shipping was more than the cost of the heads!</li>
            <li> The product is exactly what they said it would be and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with their customer service. Fast shipping to Alaska!</li>
            <li> Served its purpose well. Nice standard styrofoam head for wigmaking</li>
            <li> I purchased this set of styrofoam heads in order to showcase hats I have been making for those who need them. These models worked perfectly for that use!&lt;br /&gt;They are not expensive -- they aren&#x27;t going to win you any awards or be of use to you if you need a higher level of professional looking model head. However, they are great. They are lightweight and travel easily. Just make sure that you store them properly. I put them in a cupboard high up and out of the way. I&#x27;m sure if stored improperly they could easily be crushed. They are, after all, styrofoam.&lt;br /&gt;But, they are wonderful and I&#x27;m so happy I finally bought them</li>
            <li> I understand the item is styrofoam, and I expected a few imperfections, but I got more than a *few*. The item has clearly been used. It&#x27;s dirty! The nose is squished in and it is very noticeable. Like others, I bought this to model hats and such. I am embarrassed to take pictures of my hand-made items on this styrofoam head. I will say that it was packaged very well and I got it quickly. I suppose I got what I paid for, but I think I will be making another purchase for a different head model with a different seller.</li>
            <li> I received the styrofoam head and am excited to make a Christmas tree into a lady.  Saw one on display by J.C. Penny - am going to try.  The head is a perfect size.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t have been happier and this is exactly what I looked for in a Wig Stand.  Thanks to Amazon, as usual you are the greatest.</li>
            <li> I love knitting hats and posting them on Ravelry, and this works perfectly for that.  The size of the head is a little smaller than my head, so the hats look a little looser on it than when I wear them, but it&#x27;s still a good enough size to show the detail of the pattern.</li>
            <li> 20\\&quot; Head; my head is 23\\&quot; so I couldn&#x27;t use it to make a proper fitting wig. Still good for hanging weaves.</li>
            <li> A while ago, I started to work on a web show as the costume designer, tech producer, prop person, and makeup artist. My job requires me to make wigs, and my sister was getting sick of me using her head for that purpose, so I decided to buy an actual wig head. I looked online, and found that Sally Beauty Supply had the exact same thing for $3. Literally, the exact same thing. I measured it and everything. Just go to Sally Beauty Supply, it&#x27;s a lot cheaper. Oh, and if you want to see what the wig head can do, go to [...] (it&#x27;s my web show).</li>
            <li> I got it to model pictures for hats on etsy. It&#x27;s slightly smaller than a real human head, but it stands well and shows off the hats nicely. The size is negligible and isn&#x27;t too noticeable in the pictures. It also shipped quickly and arrived in less than a week.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife who has just starting making crochet hats, they look impressive on it.  It arrived in a few days in good condition and I don&#x27;t have any complaints.</li>
            <li> Beware, looks like a great buy, however these heads are childsize and do NOT hold the shape of your wig.  Yes the base is great for clamping down if you desire to do a hairstyle, but the head itself is sooo small even if you pinned the wig to the head it would not work!  Not worth the $$$, unless you are looking for child size heads!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this item to serve as a wig stand. However, I am in the process of returning the item, as the one I received had an unstable bottom that wobbled to begin with. Not only that, but the material is way too flimsy to serve as a wig stand. I knew ordering initially that it was made of styrofoam, but I did not realize how inadequate the material would be to hold something on it. So, if you are looking to get a wig head to hold your wig- this may not be the one to get. I am actually using a long plastic cup placed upside down as a temporary solution till I find something better.</li>
            <li> Great, for wigs heads.</li>
            <li> I got this head to take on my vacation to Venice as I had no one to travel with, and I thought the head would make for a good partner.However, the head practically refused to say a single word throughout the trip. All conversation between us was very forced and one sided.At one point we missed our train because head didn&#x27;t wake us in the morning, even though it was her alarm clock which was set. It looked good sitting next to me on the plane and in restaurants and for that I\\&quot;ll give it two stars, otherwise I do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Good product.  does what it was intended to do and that is hold a wig while it is not being worn or is being styled.  Very well priced.</li>
            <li> This has got to be the smallest head ever. Feels like it was molded from a child. Not suitable for wigs because it is not a true reperesentation of a human head, unless you&#x27;re an alien of some sort with a tiny head, don&#x27;t buy. seller was great and item did arrive on time.</li>
            <li> I bought this expect a child size head. It is I think I measured close to 19 inches. Still works for what I need but not as small as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> The head that I received was not exactly as pictured (actually looks like this: http://www.amazon.com/Beautys-Bin-4884-Foam-Mannequin/dp/B005FFQJXC/ref&#x3D;pd_sbs_bt_5 ). It&#x27;s also a lot smaller than my usual styrofoam heads. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> This arrived early and was great for fitting my Halloween wig. It is very basic, but it is just what you see on the picture.</li>
            <li> Cute little head.  Excellent for displaying hats, wigs, etc.  I added fake eyelashes - she&#x27;s a doll!</li>
            <li> I purchased this so that I could display the various hats I crochet. So far it&#x27;s worked really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it dents easily. I&#x27;ve dropped it a few times, and there&#x27;s all kinds of marks on it. But other than that, it works well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the best foam head. It arrived slightly crushed and I had to resort to sticking a book to keep it from tipping it over. I would like for the packaging to be a little bit better next time but otherwise it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and my wig looks great on it.</li>
            <li> Received this item on time.  Adequate for my needs.  Packers need to be more careful when placing this next to hard surfaces--add some padding.  The nose is not as seen in the picture--got misshappened.</li>
            <li> It works well for my needs. I am a crafter &amp; I crochet hats, so it comes in very handy. The only thing I don&#x27;t care for is the way the head is cocked to one side &amp; that it had some chunks out of the face. The only reason that matters is when I use the head to model hats, it don&#x27;t look good in the pictures when there is chunks out of it.</li>
            <li> The one I received looks nothing like these. It has dents all over and the nose looks squished.</li>
            <li> Big round headed wig stands!!! The head of these are so... big and round I had to use my knife and cut them down to size could not get the wig on the head it is so big.  If you do not have a BIG ROUND HEAD OR want your wig stretched I would not recommend this item on the other hand you could do as I did which created a mess all over the floor.</li>
            <li> Came early and in good condition. A bit smaller than a regular female head but greatly fits its purpose in displaying crochet beanies.</li>
            <li> all was fine, ordered several things that day. have not yet received the stocking wig caps yet. probably will be here soon. the wig heads were fine and just what I needed. thank you.</li>
            <li> I got a female head instead of a male head so it was patently offensive to have my wig on this while company was in my Passenger room on a Russian Tanker. Material is cheap grade foam. As a side note, this is very buoyant if the ship capsizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wig Cap (One-Size)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adult Blonde Johnny Costume Wig</li>
            <li> It small and does not resemble the size of a real size human head</li>
            <li> perfect for my needs, need it to take pictures of hats I crochet to put online to show my work off,</li>
            <li> Love being able to take better pictures of my knitted work. I plan on decoupaging with nice tissue paper or fabric. Inexpensive and great to have for those that sell their work!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and she love it, just what she wanted. They arrived in a timely matter and well protected.</li>
            <li> The neck is too short.</li>
            <li> I bought a couple of these heads so that I could paint them and put them in my room to hold all my headbands and hats. Needless to say, it worked out well!</li>
            <li> This was just what we were looking for.. Arrived in good shape and was the right height. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> love it it works great every thing that was described and has lots of purposes to use it for besides holding my wig :P</li>
            <li> Bought this to hold two Halloween wigs. I find that neither wig fits firmly on the head, the head runs just a bit smaller than I had anticipated. For whatever reason I thought the head would be more the size of a real person but that is my own mistake not the sellers. Also, I should point out, I have never owned a wig before and never owned a wig head before either, so adjust my review accordingly. :)  Other than running slightly small than I expected, they are working out fine. There is even a hole in the bottom to post mount them.</li>
            <li> this is a good item as it works great for letting you see how your earrings look on a person or hats even scarfs ..packaging was nice as it was wrapped in plastic and shipped quick..the head is a small size ladies head..good price.</li>
            <li> Use this foam head to sew wigs. It is exactly as pictured and detailed. I have no complaints!&lt;br /&gt;&amp; it is an add-on item so it&#x27;s even better!</li>
            <li> gift for the Grand Daughter, shes happy</li>
            <li> Came in record time, loved it!</li>
            <li> Arrived with a flattened nose but is very nice to display my hats. Originally used it to display head bands. It is Child sized. I have had this head for 6 months and it is keeping up pretty good. I store it in the box it came in.</li>
            <li> I make hair accessories and bought this as a display addition to my show table (spray painted first of course). You can get these much cheaper in bulk if you&#x27;re willing to wait longer, but if you need just one, this is a good buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just buy it with the knowledge that it&#x27;s on the small side - maybe more tween-sized than adult sized.</li>
            <li> I like this folkish style head. Now I can display my homemade items with a sense of humor!</li>
            <li> These are nice...but, NO BASE to them.  NO Weight to them either.&lt;br /&gt;Wish they had a BIGGER BASE...!</li>
            <li> The head that is pictured as the product is NOT what I got. I have the one in the picture, and wanted another. I got this one and noticed immediately that this was TINY. It is child sized. Now, I will be using this purely as a wig stand, I don&#x27;t need it to keep its shape, just to hold it. But this was surprising to see. If you want something larger, don&#x27;t bet on this one. I don&#x27;t know if they ship out different heads, but as I said above, I didn&#x27;t get the one above.If you aren&#x27;t picky, got for this one, or go to SallyBeauty. They have the one in the picture, for the same price or less.</li>
            <li> I purchased the foam head to create a mummy head for our Halloween party in Oct., (I start planning and preparing in January).&lt;br /&gt;The foam is perfect.  It was well packaged and delivered in a timely manner.  I would purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I guess this does the job.  It&#x27;s inexpensive and gives me a place to put my wig.  Not great as being sturdy, but serves it&#x27;s purpose at a low price</li>
            <li> It did what I needed it to do.</li>
            <li> can be shaped anyway a person want it. Can be cut into differnt shpes. can be done for more than one project.</li>
            <li> Excellent styrofoam heads, I keep all my clown wigs on them. Thank you, I am very thrilled to receive them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got 5 of these too lightand slippery so when I put longer and heavier wigs they fall from the shelf</li>
            <li> It is so lightweight that it falls over when I put a hat on it (unless it&#x27;s a very small one) .</li>
            <li> I bought this head to use it as model to photograph hats, not to decorate it or to use as ornament.  But I think it serves its purpose quite well.  It&#x27;s good to use it as wig stand, too.  I like the fact that has a very feminine face sculpted.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not very heavy and the base is not big.  I believe it would break easily under stress situations - not my case, though.</li>
            <li> I got a female head instead of a male head so it was patently offensive to have my wig on this while company was in my Passenger room on a Russian Tanker. Material is cheap grade foam. As a side note, this is very buoyant if the ship capsizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000AO5A1U Wig Cap (One-Size)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001B8SKNY Adult Blonde Johnny Costume Wig]]</li>
            <li> Extremely satisfied with this purchase. The Heads work perfectly for my displays.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a prank for my room mate. it ended so hilariously that I can not but give this product 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I mean, it&#x27;s a foam head. So it&#x27;s doing a good job at that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knit things and use this to size items for child heads because it&#x27;s pretty small. For adults, I use the male foam head.</li>
            <li> The item shipped quickly and was exactly as it was pictured.  It was packed well and I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Tjis head is smaller than my head so when I try to use it to make a u part wig it makes it a little difficult.  I measured around the head of this item and it was 21 inches</li>
            <li> I love the cutesy shape of her face and she stands up just fine. I bought this to get photos of the hats my mom crochets. No complaints.</li>
            <li> Every easy to move around, small enough to fit just about anywhere, and last a long time. Ive had this item for about two years now and Im telling with went through some small but hectic situations lol and it is still in great shape.</li>
            <li> Had a few bumps and scratches but I cover it up anyway, female face and exactly like the picture shown.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with my purchase because these foam heads were the size of a child&#x27;s head, not an adult.  Other than this they were perfect!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine.  I use it for knit hat samples. Thank you.</li>
            <li> My daughter has a plethora of hats and wigs that are strewn about.  These heads are fantastic. I wish they were less expensive, I would buy a lot more.  However, this is the best price I have seen.  My daughter instantly drew faces on them.  They are fun addition to her dress up wardrobe area.</li>
            <li> Just a Styrofoam head I got to display my home made crochet beanies. Perfect for what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Perfect for Crocheted &amp; Knitted Hats I make!! It cam in perfect condition. I will probably order a child&#x27;s version if the have them.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as a gauge for mask making. Thankfully, despite the multiple large gashes in the head, I can still use it for that. There is a lot of damage to this item.</li>
            <li> I have not used it for anything yet but I will soon for some wigs.  This head is much smaller than my own by quite a bit but still works well.</li>
            <li> I have a very big head lol but this head seemed to work well as long as u fit the cap on my head and mark it you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem</li>
