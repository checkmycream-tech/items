            <li>sun protection is rare, but it provides a much more effective and long lasting defense against UVA and UVB rays than any chemical sunscreen put there.</li>
            <li>but it does not fill greasy even during hot summer days.  </li>
            <li>Not messy and clean to use.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> It has ingredients that are unsafe or have been given warnings.Until this has been resolved I prefer to us only zinc/titanium.</li>
            <li> I love this product but am not sure that it is really chemical free or safe so that is why  I gave it four stars rather than five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had trouble finding sunscreens that don&#x27;t cause skin problems. I have had this problem for over 40 years but this product did not cause one itsy bitsy problem. As a matter of fact, it improved my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen, been using it for 6 years.  It protects both UVA &amp; B, light texture, non-greasy.  I used to purchase it through a out-of-state spa, now that Amazon carries it, it is very convenient for me to place my order. Highly recommend to customers.</li>
            <li> I am naturally fair, but I live in Arizona.  I wanted a super effective sun screen and found TIZO to have the ingredients which are necessary to protect and it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, nor does it look like I am dripping with oil when I use it.  I have used it for 3 weeks, including in 117 degree heat and find it does protect my skin.  No sunburn, or reddening of my skin and it lasts until I shower.  If I am in water a lot, I do re-apply it.</li>
            <li> this product works wonders for protecting my skin</li>
            <li> Works well and doesn&#x27;t clog pores. I just wish it were available locally and didn&#x27;t cost quite so much. :-)</li>
            <li> This product is so light.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I always wear sunscreen.  It&#x27;s hard to find SPF for the face higher than 20.  It&#x27;s price right and I was surprised to see such a large bottle</li>
            <li> It seems Ok have only used it once, its more heavy then I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Nice consistency!  Spray works great...light, creamy product that has no strong odor and goes on very well!!  Not messy and clean to use.  I would recommend highly!</li>
            <li> Of course most sunscreens will sting they run into your eyes but I was hoping this one would not.  I still use it because it does not have harmful and harsh chemicals, but I am careful on how to apply it on days when I go cycling when sweating might make it run into my eyes.  Does apply nicely, giving my face a nice brightened or luminescent look without the white mask look that other natural sunscreens do.</li>

            <li> Excellent sunscreen protection. Does not cause me to break out. it is a bit &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; so not everyone will like it. Since I do get acne, it kind of &amp;#34;covers&amp;#34; it (takes the redness out), then I put on under foundation. May not be the best stuff if you want to wear alone.</li>
            <li> High SPF but it does not fill greasy even during hot summer days.  Easy to apply and ok size to carry it in the bag if need to reapply when doing outdoor activities</li>
            <li> I am a experienced esthetician and very fair skinned, so naturally finding the best SPF is immensely important to me. Having been a fan if Juice Beauty, Terra, Hylunia, and numerous other true mineral based sunblocks, when a dermatologist insisted this was the best SPF, I was quite skeptical, until she let me feel it and read the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mineral based (zinc oxide or titanium dioxide) sun protection is rare, but it provides a much more effective and long lasting defense against UVA and UVB rays than any chemical sunscreen put there. To find a truly mineral rich SPF that does not go on like tar (Alba, I love you guys but your SPF feels like spreading cold butter) is extremely rare. This formula is amazing, I far prefer it over the tinted version.</li>
            <li> I tried numerous sunblock’s, searching for a perfect sunblock for under my foundation.  I found it in Sola Protection SPF 65.  This sunblock didn’t make my face oily, sticky or greasy.  No breakouts.  Only one word to describe it……Phenomenal!!!!</li>
            <li> These products was sent on time.&lt;br /&gt;They are excellent.&lt;br /&gt;They can protect your skin as well and its not sticky.</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin and at the same time I want to protect my skin from the sun.  This product is light weight enough but provides excellent protection and doesn&#x27;t make me break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.  Goes on light and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> works well for me ... non-oily and protects my skin from the AZ sun!</li>
            <li> Was very satisfied with the product and how fast I received it!</li>
            <li> i really like this product; being using it for years.</li>
            <li> applies to face nicely. great, natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I fail to see how anyone can purchase this item through Amazon as the seller doesn&#x27;t list all the ingredients. Is there paraben in the product? Who knows..the seller doesn&#x27;t list all the ingredients...only the attributes of the ones they want you to know about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the 21st Century, with informed consumers such as ourselves, how can you support anyone not listing the ingredients of their products? Sorry, but I won&#x27;t purchase anything unless I know what&#x27;s in it and neither should you. After all, how difficult is it to list the ingredients?</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic and oil free. I wear it in a daily basis and noticed the difference. It definitely exceeded my expectations.</li>
