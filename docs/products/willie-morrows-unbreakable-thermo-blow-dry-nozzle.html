            <li>once it&#x27;s on, it does do a great job straightening my hair.</li>
            <li>But it was great while it lasted</li>

            <li>This product does a good job not breaking</li>
            <li>and I thought I was getting a good quality comb attachment</li>
            <li>Good concept, but the metal ring will not close once it is opened.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>She was right on in saying it works great!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a licensed cosmetologist of 13 yrs and can&#x27;t even count how many attachments I&#x27;ve bought!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sturdy and made with great quality I can feel it when I&#x27;m using it how strong it is even the teeth of the comb or sturdy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just AMAZING</li>
            <li>Great fit on almost nozzle size.</li>
            <li>and I had to give it up and get my own.</li>
            <li>It looks nice though on the picture.</li>
            <li>Excellent tool for getting straight hair.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li>nice and snug with  no issues.</li>
            <li>I believe it is a great product for th right blow dryer.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>; hair in the top of my head like &#x27;Dennis the Menace&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased.  </li>
            <li>but I love this comb</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love this attachment.  </li>
            <li>The blow dryer it fits FOR SURE should be listed.</li>
            <li>Just what I&#x27;ve been looking for and this nozzle is great, works really well.</li>
            <li>I guess the manufacturer needs to improve it and do a better job before selling out their products.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve had to buy another attachment that was cheaper but is better cause it stays on the blow dryer.</li>
            <li>Fits many hair dryers with</li>
            <li>I could have just burned a $20 bill and gotten more enjoyment out of that.  </li>
            <li>This comb works great and the teeth have not broken.  </li>
            <li>so glad i made this purchase</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I have been using now for many months; I no longer have to buy plastic pic combs from the beauty store.</li>
            <li>It stays on and for some reason my blow dryer seems to work better.  </li>
            <li>I have gone through many of plastic nozzles.</li>
            <li>thought I&#x27;d love it</li>
            <li>The piece i use most melted...</li>
            <li>This one is the real deal!!!!</li>
            <li>Fits both of my blow-dryers really well!!!!</li>
            <li>It fits on most dryers and is easy to connect.</li>
            <li>Fit great, durable and way better than anything sold in stores on my natural hair.</li>
            <li>Love it, it&#x27;s durable but it didn&#x27;t fit my blower nuzzle.ðŸ˜Ÿ</li>
            <li>I love that the comb screws onto the barrel of the hair dryer for a snug fit.</li>
            <li>Still it would be wasting more money if the Solia doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>Wow is this thing great.</li>
            <li>(it broke for good after my sister used it on my nieces very thick/coarse hair)  </li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product!!</li>
            <li>All the combs that come with the blow dryer break so easily</li>
            <li>It is strong.</li>
            <li>This product feels strong and resistant to breakage.</li>
            <li>It is strong and durable</li>
            <li>it is strong, but i was not with on all blow dryers.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best comb attachment ever!</li>
            <li>Excellent Product and the comb is extremely sturdy!</li>
            <li>It fits my blow dryer fine.</li>
            <li>It seems like it should be easy to slide the metal piece in and secure it with the screw</li>
            <li>Just love it thanks Willie Morrow! !</li>
            <li>I planned to put this on my orange conair infiniti blow dryer, and the attachment didnt fit.</li>
            <li>Might be great for straight hair, but do not get if you have any kind of curly/coarse hair, especially AA.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit my hair dryer even trying to use the metal ring.</li>
            <li>it just doesn&#x27;t fit my chi dryer</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit nozzle of a lot of dryers.</li>
            <li>I have three dryers and this nozzle don&#x27;t fit any on them.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me then stop buying those cheap Sally attachments and get this one.</li>
            <li>Now am even wondering if there is any blow drier it will fit.</li>
            <li>Seems like it would have worked well if it fit, but</li>
            <li>However, what I didn&#x27;t count on was the comb&#x27;s inability to fit well on the nozzle of my blow dryer.</li>
            <li>Works great on any hair type especially ethnic hair.</li>
            <li>I will keep the pik, in case I buy another blow dryer, maybe it will fit.</li>
            <li>While I haven&#x27;t had it over a year yet, I have dropped it a couple of times and unlike the cheap ones none of the teeth broke.</li>
            <li>Consequently, the attachments don&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>product I&#x27;ve ever used to get smooth, straight hair!!!</li>
            <li>I will say, this attachment is made of super strong, durable plastic.</li>
            <li>I have tried dozens and this is the best.&lt;br /&gt;In fact, my mother still has his original nozzle that is imprinted with California Curl....</li>
            <li>This item works ok but for the price I would look around first.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I took a chance on this product and was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>Take the time to put it on right and its life changing!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t believe it to be true but it truly is unbreakable.</li>
            <li>I love this because it truly has stood the test of time with my hair and it very well put together.  </li>
            <li>I bought a Babyliss tourmaline titanium 3000 at the same time and simply followed the directions on the Thermo Blow Nozzle and it fit perfectly. ...</li>
            <li>but I just avoid touching it too much.  </li>
            <li>Not bad at all.</li>
            <li>Works great, didn&#x27;t give 4 stars due to the nozzle sliding off my dryer.</li>
            <li>comb attachment is also very sturdy and easy to attach.</li>
            <li>Very durable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>the fun began with the vendor.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price</li>
            <li>I also liked that it had adjustable rings to attach to match different types</li>
            <li>I think that&#x27;s the correct name of that dryer listed as a package deal, but has anyone tried to attach this attachment with success.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay have use other ones that perform better ,I find myself contuining to tighten the nozzle up a lot</li>
            <li>Now it does the job just right.</li>
            <li>The opening just wasn&#x27;t the right size or shape.</li>
            <li>Still trying to figure the right way of putting it on my twin turbo 3200 so that it will stay on</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why someone in their right mind would make a product that is not compatible with anything at all.</li>
            <li>It is strong, well made, and has several couplers that will allow it to fit others dryers as well.</li>
            <li>and I am able to get a nice blowout on my below shoulder length thick hair within 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>it is made for a blow dryer that is open at the end, my blow dryer and most blow dryers have the heating elements right at the edge of the opening.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much for timely delivery.</li>
            <li>When I first saw this, I thought this would be the answer to my hair-drying prayers.</li>
            <li>My dryer was too hot for this nozzle.  </li>
            <li>After first use, I should&#x27;ve returned it</li>
            <li>Like I said I would look around first.</li>
            <li>After the first one broke, I thought maybe it was a fluke</li>
            <li>It works but still a pretty not well thought about invention for a hairstylist.</li>
            <li>It would be helpful if someone would list the EXACT model and name that they attached it to.</li>
            <li>This pik is great to straighten thick curly hair.</li>
            <li>Someone to tell me exactly which drier this thing fits.</li>
            <li>The insert melted within 30 seconds of attaching to hot dryer nozzle.</li>
            <li>I love this comb the last one lasted 10 years</li>
            <li>My story is the same as many others......</li>
            <li>but with first use it caused my hair blower to overheat and die.  </li>
            <li>It does get hot</li>
            <li>Very soon just to have an extra on hand, I will be ordering another one. :-)</li>
            <li>I love the Willie Morrow&#x27;s Unbreakable Thermo Blow Dry Nozzle.  </li>
            <li>Customers are smart...</li>
            <li>OK, hair is a bit too thick and curly to use this easily and without hurting.</li>
            <li>Great product, only two problems are, (1) it gets hot with constant use (multiple clients).</li>
            <li>There was a metal rod in the middle of the comb that no longer stays in with my holding method, but it works fine for me with out it.</li>
            <li>The other one doesn&#x27;t work any better than the first one.  </li>
            <li>Try to find an attachment that comes in one whole piece w/o seams.</li>
            <li>This item is much needed.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>And the fourth one is the one I had to remove for it to fit my dryer.</li>
            <li>This nozzle is called &amp;#34;unbreakable&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s very breakable.  </li>
            <li>seller was fast</li>
            <li>I really did not like this product.</li>
            <li>(2) the hair sometimes get caught on the very end off the comb in the crack.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and blow dries hair bone straight.  </li>
            <li>I had spent more time trying to get a solution</li>
            <li>Leaves hair straight, and cuts drying time.</li>
            <li>Makes blow drying much easier.</li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
            <li>very well made</li>
            <li>This one is very sturdy and can handle my hair texture.</li>
            <li>Thanks Willie Morrow who created it and Amazon for selling it.</li>
            <li>but when it broke during normal use, mayabeauty didn&#x27;t see a problem with that!  </li>
            <li>The blow dry comb doesn&#x27;t fit my hair dryer.</li>
            <li>The first time I attached this to my Conair dryer, it got so hot that it actually burned my skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>original comb attachment became loose and couldn&#x27;t find a decent one in a store.  </li>
            <li>But what good is the comb if the inserts are broken.</li>
            <li>It took awhile for me to properly attach the nozzle to my dryer, but after it was afixed, I have been able to blow dry my curly-kinky hair with ease and without breakage or pain.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mine 9 years and it is just like new.</li>
            <li>maybe I&#x27;ll spend $100 on a new blow dryer</li>
            <li>I and my daughters are Black, and our hair is course and easily tangled after being washed.  </li>
            <li>Product does not fit my blowdryer (which I would have no way of knowing prior to purchasing) and basically they are advising to return at my own risk...</li>
            <li>It gets my hair really smooth so that I only have to flat iron to style and not to straighten.</li>
            <li>The Thermo blow dry nozzle was well worth the price I paid which was $17.00 and some change.</li>
            <li>This fit my T3 Featherweight with a little tweaking.  </li>
            <li>and they clearly state that they dispose of the product.</li>
            <li>I filed a request to return it, and they sent me 2 screens of legalese doubletalk about how they weren&#x27;t the manufacturer, only the seller, so they weren&#x27;t responsible, so they wouldn&#x27;t refund my money.</li>
            <li>It has not come off and has made my natural hair styling a lot easier.</li>
            <li>I even had my fiancÃ© use a professional drill to put this thing on</li>
            <li>Once I used it for the first time, I cannot believe that I waited so long to buy it.  </li>
            <li>In spite of that tiny flaw I think it performs very well.</li>
            <li>Compare me with Diana Ross or Chaka Khun as far as the thickness.</li>
            <li>The simple solution would be to rotate the attachment 180Â° when switching sides, but by the time I switch sides the attachment is too hot to pull off or rotate with bare hands.</li>
            <li>Did not fit my hair dryer and it is not user friendly</li>
            <li>Great purchase especially for thick black hair.</li>
            <li>Sometimes when running for long periods of time it does have a tendency to slip off but overall this is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>When natural it does blow out all the natural curl so for me being a hairdresser, it&#x27;s a way to work smarter and not harder</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone who had similar problems with</li>
            <li>HAIRSTYLISTS, do NOT buy this if your someone who switches out your blow dry attachments per guest cause this one you have to do soooo much work just to get it on or off.</li>
            <li>A little confusing at first, the fitting rings.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well, but I had a difficult time getting it to fit my chi.</li>
            <li>ESPECIALLY for natural hair.</li>
            <li>Prior to finding this on amazon in which I frequently shop.</li>
            <li>It is the only one I found that would not pop off while combing through my natural hair.  </li>
            <li>Initially, it confused my wife, but anyone that has used a hose clamp before will be able to figure it out.</li>
            <li>If you frequently change the attachments on your blow dryer, this may not be the product for you (or you should consider having a second dryer that you use only with this attachment to keep you from having to take it on and off).</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it gets very hot when blow drying my hair, and because I am right handed sometimes if I&#x27;m not extra careful the metal screw comes in contact with my scalp when I&#x27;m doing the left side of my head.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of natural, thick little girl clients that usually get their hair blow dried every visit, and this comb works wonderful for their hair!!!</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s just AMAZING</li>
            <li> Great fit on almost nozzle size.</li>
            <li> and I had to give it up and get my own.</li>
            <li> It looks nice though on the picture.</li>
            <li> Excellent tool for getting straight hair.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> nice and snug with  no issues.</li>
            <li> I believe it is a great product for th right blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> ; hair in the top of my head like &#x27;Dennis the Menace&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased.  </li>
            <li> but I love this comb</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love this attachment.  </li>
            <li> The blow dryer it fits FOR SURE should be listed.</li>
            <li> Just what I&#x27;ve been looking for and this nozzle is great, works really well.</li>
            <li> I guess the manufacturer needs to improve it and do a better job before selling out their products.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve had to buy another attachment that was cheaper but is better cause it stays on the blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Fits many hair dryers with</li>
            <li> I could have just burned a $20 bill and gotten more enjoyment out of that.  </li>
            <li> This comb works great and the teeth have not broken.  </li>
            <li> so glad i made this purchase</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I have been using now for many months; I no longer have to buy plastic pic combs from the beauty store.</li>
            <li> It stays on and for some reason my blow dryer seems to work better.  </li>
            <li> I have gone through many of plastic nozzles.</li>
            <li> thought I&#x27;d love it</li>
            <li> The piece i use most melted...</li>
            <li> This one is the real deal!!!!</li>
            <li> Fits both of my blow-dryers really well!!!!</li>
            <li> It fits on most dryers and is easy to connect.</li>
            <li> Fit great, durable and way better than anything sold in stores on my natural hair.</li>
            <li> Love it, it&#x27;s durable but it didn&#x27;t fit my blower nuzzle.ðŸ˜Ÿ</li>
            <li> I love that the comb screws onto the barrel of the hair dryer for a snug fit.</li>
            <li> Still it would be wasting more money if the Solia doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> Wow is this thing great.</li>
            <li> (it broke for good after my sister used it on my nieces very thick/coarse hair)  </li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product!!</li>
            <li> All the combs that come with the blow dryer break so easily</li>
            <li> It is strong.</li>
            <li> This product feels strong and resistant to breakage.</li>
            <li> It is strong and durable</li>
            <li> it is strong, but i was not with on all blow dryers.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best comb attachment ever!</li>
            <li> Excellent Product and the comb is extremely sturdy!</li>
            <li> It fits my blow dryer fine.</li>
            <li> It seems like it should be easy to slide the metal piece in and secure it with the screw</li>
            <li> Just love it thanks Willie Morrow! !</li>
            <li> I planned to put this on my orange conair infiniti blow dryer, and the attachment didnt fit.</li>
            <li> Might be great for straight hair, but do not get if you have any kind of curly/coarse hair, especially AA.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit my hair dryer even trying to use the metal ring.</li>
            <li> it just doesn&#x27;t fit my chi dryer</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit nozzle of a lot of dryers.</li>
            <li> I have three dryers and this nozzle don&#x27;t fit any on them.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me then stop buying those cheap Sally attachments and get this one.</li>
            <li> Now am even wondering if there is any blow drier it will fit.</li>
            <li> Seems like it would have worked well if it fit, but</li>
            <li> However, what I didn&#x27;t count on was the comb&#x27;s inability to fit well on the nozzle of my blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Works great on any hair type especially ethnic hair.</li>
            <li> I will keep the pik, in case I buy another blow dryer, maybe it will fit.</li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t had it over a year yet, I have dropped it a couple of times and unlike the cheap ones none of the teeth broke.</li>
            <li> Consequently, the attachments don&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> product I&#x27;ve ever used to get smooth, straight hair!!!</li>
            <li> I will say, this attachment is made of super strong, durable plastic.</li>
            <li> I have tried dozens and this is the best.&lt;br /&gt;In fact, my mother still has his original nozzle that is imprinted with California Curl....</li>
            <li> This item works ok but for the price I would look around first.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I took a chance on this product and was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Take the time to put it on right and its life changing!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe it to be true but it truly is unbreakable.</li>
            <li> I love this because it truly has stood the test of time with my hair and it very well put together.  </li>
            <li> I bought a Babyliss tourmaline titanium 3000 at the same time and simply followed the directions on the Thermo Blow Nozzle and it fit perfectly. ...</li>
            <li> but I just avoid touching it too much.  </li>
            <li> Not bad at all.</li>
            <li> Works great, didn&#x27;t give 4 stars due to the nozzle sliding off my dryer.</li>
            <li> comb attachment is also very sturdy and easy to attach.</li>
            <li> Very durable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> the fun began with the vendor.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price</li>
            <li> I also liked that it had adjustable rings to attach to match different types</li>
            <li> I think that&#x27;s the correct name of that dryer listed as a package deal, but has anyone tried to attach this attachment with success.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay have use other ones that perform better ,I find myself contuining to tighten the nozzle up a lot</li>
            <li> Now it does the job just right.</li>
            <li> The opening just wasn&#x27;t the right size or shape.</li>
            <li> Still trying to figure the right way of putting it on my twin turbo 3200 so that it will stay on</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why someone in their right mind would make a product that is not compatible with anything at all.</li>
            <li> It is strong, well made, and has several couplers that will allow it to fit others dryers as well.</li>
            <li> and I am able to get a nice blowout on my below shoulder length thick hair within 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> it is made for a blow dryer that is open at the end, my blow dryer and most blow dryers have the heating elements right at the edge of the opening.  </li>
            <li> Thank you very much for timely delivery.</li>
            <li> When I first saw this, I thought this would be the answer to my hair-drying prayers.</li>
            <li> My dryer was too hot for this nozzle.  </li>
            <li> After first use, I should&#x27;ve returned it</li>
            <li> Like I said I would look around first.</li>
            <li> After the first one broke, I thought maybe it was a fluke</li>
            <li> It works but still a pretty not well thought about invention for a hairstylist.</li>
            <li> It would be helpful if someone would list the EXACT model and name that they attached it to.</li>
            <li> This pik is great to straighten thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> Someone to tell me exactly which drier this thing fits.</li>
            <li> The insert melted within 30 seconds of attaching to hot dryer nozzle.</li>
            <li> I love this comb the last one lasted 10 years</li>
            <li> My story is the same as many others......</li>
            <li> but with first use it caused my hair blower to overheat and die.  </li>
            <li> It does get hot</li>
            <li> Very soon just to have an extra on hand, I will be ordering another one. :-)</li>
            <li> I love the Willie Morrow&#x27;s Unbreakable Thermo Blow Dry Nozzle.  </li>
            <li> Customers are smart...</li>
            <li> OK, hair is a bit too thick and curly to use this easily and without hurting.</li>
            <li> Great product, only two problems are, (1) it gets hot with constant use (multiple clients).</li>
            <li> There was a metal rod in the middle of the comb that no longer stays in with my holding method, but it works fine for me with out it.</li>
            <li> The other one doesn&#x27;t work any better than the first one.  </li>
            <li> Try to find an attachment that comes in one whole piece w/o seams.</li>
            <li> This item is much needed.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> And the fourth one is the one I had to remove for it to fit my dryer.</li>
            <li> This nozzle is called &amp;#34;unbreakable&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s very breakable.  </li>
            <li> seller was fast</li>
            <li> I really did not like this product.</li>
            <li> (2) the hair sometimes get caught on the very end off the comb in the crack.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and blow dries hair bone straight.  </li>
            <li> I had spent more time trying to get a solution</li>
            <li> Leaves hair straight, and cuts drying time.</li>
            <li> Makes blow drying much easier.</li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
            <li> very well made</li>
            <li> This one is very sturdy and can handle my hair texture.</li>
            <li> Thanks Willie Morrow who created it and Amazon for selling it.</li>
            <li> but when it broke during normal use, mayabeauty didn&#x27;t see a problem with that!  </li>
            <li> The blow dry comb doesn&#x27;t fit my hair dryer.</li>
            <li> The first time I attached this to my Conair dryer, it got so hot that it actually burned my skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> original comb attachment became loose and couldn&#x27;t find a decent one in a store.  </li>
            <li> But what good is the comb if the inserts are broken.</li>
            <li> It took awhile for me to properly attach the nozzle to my dryer, but after it was afixed, I have been able to blow dry my curly-kinky hair with ease and without breakage or pain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine 9 years and it is just like new.</li>
            <li> maybe I&#x27;ll spend $100 on a new blow dryer</li>
            <li> I and my daughters are Black, and our hair is course and easily tangled after being washed.  </li>
            <li> Product does not fit my blowdryer (which I would have no way of knowing prior to purchasing) and basically they are advising to return at my own risk...</li>
            <li> It gets my hair really smooth so that I only have to flat iron to style and not to straighten.</li>
            <li> The Thermo blow dry nozzle was well worth the price I paid which was $17.00 and some change.</li>
            <li> This fit my T3 Featherweight with a little tweaking.  </li>
            <li> and they clearly state that they dispose of the product.</li>
            <li> I filed a request to return it, and they sent me 2 screens of legalese doubletalk about how they weren&#x27;t the manufacturer, only the seller, so they weren&#x27;t responsible, so they wouldn&#x27;t refund my money.</li>
            <li> It has not come off and has made my natural hair styling a lot easier.</li>
            <li> I even had my fiancÃ© use a professional drill to put this thing on</li>
            <li> Once I used it for the first time, I cannot believe that I waited so long to buy it.  </li>
            <li> In spite of that tiny flaw I think it performs very well.</li>
            <li> Compare me with Diana Ross or Chaka Khun as far as the thickness.</li>
            <li> The simple solution would be to rotate the attachment 180Â° when switching sides, but by the time I switch sides the attachment is too hot to pull off or rotate with bare hands.</li>
            <li> Did not fit my hair dryer and it is not user friendly</li>
            <li> Great purchase especially for thick black hair.</li>
            <li> Sometimes when running for long periods of time it does have a tendency to slip off but overall this is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> When natural it does blow out all the natural curl so for me being a hairdresser, it&#x27;s a way to work smarter and not harder</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone who had similar problems with</li>
            <li> HAIRSTYLISTS, do NOT buy this if your someone who switches out your blow dry attachments per guest cause this one you have to do soooo much work just to get it on or off.</li>
            <li> A little confusing at first, the fitting rings.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well, but I had a difficult time getting it to fit my chi.</li>
            <li> ESPECIALLY for natural hair.</li>
            <li> Prior to finding this on amazon in which I frequently shop.</li>
            <li> It is the only one I found that would not pop off while combing through my natural hair.  </li>
            <li> Initially, it confused my wife, but anyone that has used a hose clamp before will be able to figure it out.</li>
            <li> If you frequently change the attachments on your blow dryer, this may not be the product for you (or you should consider having a second dryer that you use only with this attachment to keep you from having to take it on and off).</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it gets very hot when blow drying my hair, and because I am right handed sometimes if I&#x27;m not extra careful the metal screw comes in contact with my scalp when I&#x27;m doing the left side of my head.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of natural, thick little girl clients that usually get their hair blow dried every visit, and this comb works wonderful for their hair!!!</li>
            <li> I would purchase 2 at a time before, just to get through a blow dry and maybe have 1, maybe, left over for next go around.</li>
            <li> I wish the description stated this attachment is only compatible with long barrel blow dryers.</li>
            <li> Does not fit my blow dyer had to buy a new one ðŸ‘Ž</li>
            <li> With African American coarse texture hair, over the years i broke a lot of flimsy blow dryer comb attachments that would only last me a few months at a time.  </li>
            <li> But with some research online, I found that if you completely unscrew the ring, wrap drawer liner (grip) around the dryer and then sandwich the comb onto the dryer and screw tightly, it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> It has held up for several uses over the last few months and that&#x27;s longer than any generic I purchased in a local bss.</li>
            <li> No different from the other generic attachments.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a little bit odd that the largest adapter was still a little small for what seemed like a quite average-sized dryer nozzle, but you&#x27;ll likely be able to make it work.</li>
            <li> Difficult to put on my chi blow dryer had to watch YouTube video for detailed help.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think you should have to resort to duct tape as some have done and the Solia that it might fit is expensive.</li>
            <li> However It is quite difficult to unscrew it, then it didn&#x27;t fit on my hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> After assembling it, I thought hmm this is a strange contraption.</li>
            <li> With the &#x27;Willie Morrow&#x27;s Unbreakable Thermo Blow Dry Comb&#x27;, I do not have that problem.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser suggested this product as hers has been attached to her blow dryer for several YEARS and has withstood heavy use on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> It has withstood high heat and my thick, curly 4a hair for over three years.</li>
            <li> I thought that this was supposed to be a hard rubber comb, but it looks and feels like the one I can purchase at a beauty supply store except for the added metal bar that is at the base of the prongs, this could lead to extreme heat damage on the hair because it is not reported what kind of metal the bar is and how hot it can</li>
            <li> I have long thick natural hair and all other blow dryer combs break instantly.</li>
            <li> Be aware that anything you buy from this seller is strictly &#x27;buyer beware&#x27; - don&#x27;t expect them to stand behind it.</li>
            <li> True it looks weird and you need to use a screwdriver to attach it to the blow dryer</li>
            <li> Willie Morrows&#x27; attachment has a seam down each side which rips my coarse hair out.</li>
            <li> only down side is the way the comb attaches to the dryer.  </li>
            <li> The inner rings were all broken and the ends of the comb to do appear to have been filed down and look very jagged around the edges.</li>
            <li> By the third use all teeth from the Conair blow dryer comb are completely missing.  </li>
            <li> It did not fit my dryer, so I bought a different brace for it.  </li>
            <li> A few days later, my hairdresser asked what had &amp;#34;fried&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Im not much of a dryer comb connoisseur</li>
            <li> Does the job expected.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time but bag looked like it had been taped back together, it was missing the silver strap that holds it together, so I need to return.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my husband to fix and he could not get it closed either.</li>
            <li> It did not fit my short barrel blow dryer</li>
            <li> Works as expected.  </li>
            <li> So right now it&#x27;s useless to me.</li>
            <li> other brands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After endless searching and reading reviews for a comb attachment for my Solano hair dryer, I decided to purchase this products.</li>
            <li> But other than that, it works well no breaking</li>
            <li> Would have saved a lot of money on other attachments that did not work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands of blow dry comb attachments and had to replace them two or three times a year because the teeth would start to break off after just a few uses.  </li>
            <li> Bcause I use the blow dry comb everyday.</li>
            <li> The attachment is a little tricky at first, but it worked wonders on my very thick hair!</li>
            <li> If you find that the nozzle is slipping off, just add a little duct tape to the nozzle of the dryer</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, that was the whole point of purchasing it.</li>
            <li> So far none of the pick has broken.</li>
            <li> The seams opened slightly when attached to my Revlon Tourmaline Ionic hair dryer; hair would get caught and be ripped out.</li>
            <li> Hair drys in half the time.</li>
            <li> I am an black women with thick long hair which I am about 3 inches from sitting on it.</li>
            <li> Does not fit the average dryer.</li>
            <li> I have used this comb for about two months and no teeth are missing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the comb approximately 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I did not fit the hair dryer I have.</li>
            <li> Tossed item, what a waste.</li>
            <li> The nozzle, that of a Conair Infiniti Pro, is tapered and therefore does not fit well with this comb ...</li>
            <li> Again another pik that did not fit my blow dryer (Revlon).  </li>
            <li> item did not fit my blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick when wet</li>
            <li> No more combs on the floor with missing &amp;#34;teeth.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I was somewhat disappointed with this product because after mounting it on my blow dryer, it was tight at first and then</li>
            <li> I used to dread having to blow dry my hair before flat ironing, but this product makes the process less painful</li>
            <li> It was a little hard to figure out how to put it on</li>
            <li> unfortunately i can not use this...am so mad because it doesn&#x27;t fit on any of my three blow-driers.</li>
            <li> Over the past year I have purchased about six of the  Conair</li>
            <li> I was soooo over buying comb attachments every few months and knew there had to be a solution to the problem!</li>
            <li> I was never able to use it.</li>
            <li> Does not fit to dryer at all, keeps popping off!</li>
            <li> The package came with three attachments all were to small.</li>
            <li> and I was not able to get a refund since I opened it.</li>
            <li> It does NOT fit the Babyliss blowdryer!</li>
            <li> but seriously, my blow driers are small and it still will not fit .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to attach to the blow dryer and keep it on...</li>
            <li> Never comes off my dryer and wasn&#x27;t too hard to attach.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair</li>
            <li> This did not fit either of my two blow dryers and one of the ring was broken.</li>
            <li> It did wonders for my thick hair in a fraction of the time it use to take.</li>
            <li> And I mean BURNED it.  </li>
            <li> I mean, the word &amp;#34;Unbreakable&amp;#34; is in the name of the product -</li>
            <li> As a result, the teeth of the combs used in the past have broken.  </li>
            <li> I would hate to purchase a new hair dryer just to have a comb that fits, but i guess i will if i have to.</li>
            <li> I knew from opening the package that it was no good</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not good.</li>
            <li> Duh!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have very thick hair and it combed through it with ease.</li>
            <li> If you have very thick hair that you need to straighten without using a pressing comb, this is the product for you.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise it rests in my waste basket with all the failed products that are too expensive to throw away but to non functional to use.</li>
            <li> And not one tooth was broken.</li>
            <li> Are all 4 the rings supposed to come separated/ broken??  </li>
            <li> It is poor quality junk.</li>
            <li> so I was not about to toy with hair breakage by using a poorly made product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m stuck with a ridiculous piece of plastic that I CANNOT USE!  </li>
            <li> There are a lot of sharp edges around the base of this unit and it catches and tears the hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so confused!</li>
            <li> The part was useless when heated.</li>
            <li> My dryer was expensive and I did not want to buy another one just to have a comb attachment.  </li>
            <li> So disappointing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Am so mad.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and with this tool, I manage to get through the bush!!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointing-</li>
            <li> so I can use this $20 piece of crap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in this very expensive but ineffective product.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how bad it was before purchasing this ONE!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> am very disappointed and will be attempting to return this product.</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> Return policy is terrible.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I love the Willie Morrow&#x27;s Unbreakable Thermo Blow Dry Nozzle.  Over the past year I have purchased about six of the  Conair blow dryer combs only for the teeth to begin to fall after two uses. By the third use all teeth from the Conair blow dryer comb are completely missing.  I have used this comb for about two months and no teeth are missing.  It is the best blow dryer comb on the market.</li>
            <li> It is strong. So far none of the pick has broken. Which is great. However it does not stay attached to dryer - it slides off or pops off during use even though it is attached as tightly as possible</li>
            <li> I was soooo over buying comb attachments every few months and knew there had to be a solution to the problem! I&#x27;m a licensed cosmetologist of 13 yrs and can&#x27;t even count how many attachments I&#x27;ve bought! This one is the real deal!!!! I have a lot of natural, thick little girl clients that usually get their hair blow dried every visit, and this comb works wonderful for their hair!!! It&#x27;s sturdy and made with great quality I can feel it when I&#x27;m using it how strong it is even the teeth of the comb or sturdy I haven&#x27;t lost one yet!! I wish I would have found this years ago!!! Definitely worth every penny!!!!! One satisfied cosmetologist!!!! ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li> Got to have it! Love it.</li>
            <li> It did not fit my dryer, so I bought a different brace for it.  Now it does the job just right.</li>
            <li> When I first saw this, I thought this would be the answer to my hair-drying prayers. Big mistake. The first time I attached this to my Conair dryer, it got so hot that it actually burned my skin. And I mean BURNED it.  When my husband tried to remove it, it broke into pieces.  A few days later, my hairdresser asked what had &amp;#34;fried&amp;#34; my hair.  &amp;#34;If it burned your skin,&amp;#34; she said, &amp;#34;imagine what it did to your hair.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Then the fun began with the vendor. I filed a request to return it, and they sent me 2 screens of legalese doubletalk about how they weren&#x27;t the manufacturer, only the seller, so they weren&#x27;t responsible, so they wouldn&#x27;t refund my money. I mean, the word &amp;#34;Unbreakable&amp;#34; is in the name of the product - but when it broke during normal use, mayabeauty didn&#x27;t see a problem with that!  If this isn&#x27;t a defective product, what is? Be aware that anything you buy from this seller is strictly &#x27;buyer beware&#x27; - don&#x27;t expect them to stand behind it. This product will burn you - and so will the seller.</li>
            <li> Just love it thanks Willie Morrow! !</li>
            <li> My dryer was too hot for this nozzle.  The insert started to warp and then eventually break under the pressure of the heat.  I&#x27;ve only had the comb approximately 3 weeks. The comb itself didn&#x27;t break.  But what good is the comb if the inserts are broken.</li>
            <li> Im not much of a dryer comb connoisseur but this is a good one. I planned to put this on my orange conair infiniti blow dryer, and the attachment didnt fit. But with some research online, I found that if you completely unscrew the ring, wrap drawer liner (grip) around the dryer and then sandwich the comb onto the dryer and screw tightly, it works like a charm. It has not come off and has made my natural hair styling a lot easier. There was a metal rod in the middle of the comb that no longer stays in with my holding method, but it works fine for me with out it. I think this is a great product.</li>
            <li> attaches to ALMOST any hand dryer.</li>
            <li> I did not fit the hair dryer I have. I was never able to use it.</li>
            <li> I was somewhat disappointed with this product because after mounting it on my blow dryer, it was tight at first and then a week or two later it came off. I could not tighten back without stripping the screw utilized to tighten the object.</li>
            <li> Willie Morrows&#x27; attachment has a seam down each side which rips my coarse hair out. I now have 1&amp;#34; hair in the top of my head like &#x27;Dennis the Menace&#x27;. Might be great for straight hair, but do not get if you have any kind of curly/coarse hair, especially AA. You&#x27;ll regret it if you do... Try to find an attachment that comes in one whole piece w/o seams.</li>
            <li> Perfect tool. Does the job expected.</li>
            <li> This item is much needed. I have long thick natural hair and all other blow dryer combs break instantly. I would purchase 2 at a time before, just to get through a blow dry and maybe have 1, maybe, left over for next go around. That&#x27;s how bad it was before purchasing this ONE! It&#x27;s just AMAZING</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. A little confusing at first, the fitting rings. Instructions only pictured 3 rings, when there are actually 4. And the fourth one is the one I had to remove for it to fit my dryer. But when i figured that out and used it, I agree, the teeth are unbreakable.....We&#x27;ll just wait on the rest.</li>
            <li> This product is garbage. So disappointing. After just 2 uses, this &amp;#34;unbreakable&amp;#34; attachment comb did indeed break. I knew from opening the package that it was no good but I wanted to give it a try. After assembling it, I thought hmm this is a strange contraption. After first use, I should&#x27;ve returned it but I stayed hopeful. It literally disassembled in my hands.Please spend your $20+ elsewhere. I wish I bought a different attachae comb.</li>
            <li> Does not fit my blow dyer had to buy a new one ðŸ‘Ž</li>
            <li> This is THE BEST dryer nozzle! I have tried dozens and this is the best.&lt;br /&gt;In fact, my mother still has his original nozzle that is imprinted with California Curl....yeah, remember that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I &amp;#34;borrowed&amp;#34; hers for years until she found out and I had to give it up and get my own. I&#x27;ve had mine 9 years and it is just like new. If you find that the nozzle is slipping off, just add a little duct tape to the nozzle of the dryer so it isn&#x27;t so slippery.</li>
            <li> Terrible. Does not fit to dryer at all, keeps popping off!</li>
            <li> Love it, it&#x27;s durable but it didn&#x27;t fit my blower nuzzle.ðŸ˜Ÿ</li>
            <li> My hairdresser suggested this product as hers has been attached to her blow dryer for several YEARS and has withstood heavy use on a daily basis.  I&#x27;ve used other brands of blow dry comb attachments and had to replace them two or three times a year because the teeth would start to break off after just a few uses.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who had similar problems with other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side is the way the comb attaches to the dryer.  It requires a screwdriver and it&#x27;s easiest if once you get it on, you leave it on.  If you frequently change the attachments on your blow dryer, this may not be the product for you (or you should consider having a second dryer that you use only with this attachment to keep you from having to take it on and off).</li>
            <li> I had my last nozzle for over 10 years, I will always use this nozzle for the duration of my career! That&#x27;s for making a product that is so durable.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer comb does its job. I had a &amp;#34;con-air universal&amp;#34; hair comb, but the barrel on my dryer is smaller and the comb would always fall off. With the &#x27;Willie Morrow&#x27;s Unbreakable Thermo Blow Dry Comb&#x27;, I do not have that problem. I love that the comb screws onto the barrel of the hair dryer for a snug fit. No more combs on the floor with missing &amp;#34;teeth.&amp;#34; Thank you!</li>
            <li> OK, hair is a bit too thick and curly to use this easily and without hurting. Difficult to put on my chi blow dryer had to watch YouTube video for detailed help.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit my hair dryer even trying to use the metal ring. The opening just wasn&#x27;t the right size or shape.</li>
            <li> This item works ok but for the price I would look around first. My experience is that the comb continues to fall off the blow dryer while it is in use. I have tried tightening the metal band but nothing works. Like I said I would look around first.</li>
            <li> This fit my T3 Featherweight with a little tweaking.  I am so pleased.  It is strong, well made, and has several couplers that will allow it to fit others dryers as well.</li>
            <li> Great fit on almost nozzle size. This product feels strong and resistant to breakage. I have very thick hair and with this tool, I manage to get through the bush!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe it to be true but it truly is unbreakable. It fits my blow dryer fine. Sometimes when running for long periods of time it does have a tendency to slip off but overall this is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It was a little hard to figure out how to put it on but once I got it on... It worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> This is awesome!!! I have really thick hair but this attachment makes blow drying my hair a breeze.  I even purchased one for my mom after she used the one that I have only once. I definitely recommend this item!!</li>
            <li> I love this attachment!!!! The only blow dryer comb that helps straighten your hair..Just Awesome!!!  You will not be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> This nozzle is called &amp;#34;unbreakable&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s very breakable.  And it doesn&#x27;t stay on my Solia hairdryer.  I even had my fiancÃ© use a professional drill to put this thing on and still it kept falling off.  After the first one broke, I thought maybe it was a fluke (it broke for good after my sister used it on my nieces very thick/coarse hair)  so I ordered another one.  The other one doesn&#x27;t work any better than the first one.  I&#x27;m very disappointed in this very expensive but ineffective product.</li>
            <li> Still trying to figure the right way of putting it on my twin turbo 3200 so that it will stay on but I love this comb it makes my job easier</li>
            <li> product lives up to the advertised claims.  It is strong and durable, tips did not break even if it landed on floor</li>
            <li> Hands down the best comb attachment ever! Take the time to put it on right and its life changing! Definitely worth the price</li>
            <li> This did not fit either of my two blow dryers and one of the ring was broken. I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> So I took a chance in buying this looked up videos of even how to put it on, and yeah it just doesn&#x27;t fit my chi dryer SOOOOO I had to force it onto my Paul Mitchell Turbolight blow dryer but instead of putting it into thee attachment slot I put it over the tip of the dryer. It works but still a pretty not well thought about invention for a hairstylist. HAIRSTYLISTS, do NOT buy this if your someone who switches out your blow dry attachments per guest cause this one you have to do soooo much work just to get it on or off.</li>
            <li> The best blow dryer nozzle on the market. My daughter and I have very thick hair and it combed through it with ease. Did not slip off the hairdryer at all! And not one tooth was broken. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product and the comb is extremely sturdy!</li>
            <li> All the combs that come with the blow dryer break so easily and this one&lt;br /&gt;does not and it works great and fits my blow dryer. No problem</li>
            <li> Are all 4 the rings supposed to come separated/ broken??  It doesn&#x27;t show that in the instructions. I&#x27;m so confused!</li>
            <li> Fits on my babyliss dryer and works great!</li>
            <li> Does not fit the average dryer.</li>
            <li> didnt stay on any of my dryers... seller was fast</li>
            <li> No different from the other generic attachments. Doesn&#x27;t fit nozzle of a lot of dryers. Best thing is to get a dryer that comes with its own attachment.</li>
            <li> The seams opened slightly when attached to my Revlon Tourmaline Ionic hair dryer; hair would get caught and be ripped out. One of the plastic inserts melted after a couple of uses. I will say, this attachment is made of super strong, durable plastic. It has withstood high heat and my thick, curly 4a hair for over three years.</li>
            <li> After endless searching and reading reviews for a comb attachment for my Solano hair dryer, I decided to purchase this products. It took awhile for me to properly attach the nozzle to my dryer, but after it was afixed, I have been able to blow dry my curly-kinky hair with ease and without breakage or pain. I used to dread having to blow dry my hair before flat ironing, but this product makes the process less painful and I am able to get a nice blowout on my below shoulder length thick hair within 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> No need to buy another dryer......</li>
            <li> It just arrived and I already dropped it. To my surprise and delight no lost teeth. So far so good.</li>
            <li> I have three dryers and this nozzle don&#x27;t fit any on them. The package came with three attachments all were to small.</li>
            <li> Fits both of my blow-dryers really well!!!! I recommend this product</li>
            <li> Fit great, durable and way better than anything sold in stores on my natural hair.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well, but I had a difficult time getting it to fit my chi. It&#x27;s on there now, albeit somewhat precariously.</li>
            <li> Bcause I use the blow dry comb everyday. I am a hairstylist. It wonderful!!!!! I bought one before it last me for years.</li>
            <li> This did not work on my Chi Pro blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I really did not like this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to attach to the blow dryer and keep it on... once it&#x27;s on, it does do a great job straightening my hair. I just wish they came up with an easier way to attach it to the blow dryer.</li>
            <li> If you have very thick hair that you need to straighten without using a pressing comb, this is the product for you.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over 7yrs and I just recently had to replace it.  It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Love it! It met all my expectations. It did wonders for my thick hair in a fraction of the time it use to take.</li>
            <li> Great product, only two problems are, (1) it gets hot with constant use (multiple clients). (2) the hair sometimes get caught on the very end off the comb in the crack. Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product!!</li>
            <li> The best comb attachment ever!</li>
            <li> There are a lot of sharp edges around the base of this unit and it catches and tears the hair.</li>
            <li> It fits on most dryers and is easy to connect. It heats up fast and blow dries hair bone straight.  The teeth on the comb are truly unbreakable and is perfect for any hair texture, length, or style.</li>
            <li> it is strong, but i was not with on all blow dryers.</li>
            <li> This attachment is what I have been searching for years!  With African American coarse texture hair, over the years i broke a lot of flimsy blow dryer comb attachments that would only last me a few months at a time.  I love this because it truly has stood the test of time with my hair and it very well put together.  I also liked that it had adjustable rings to attach to match different types blow dryer nozzles!  My package came in good condition.</li>
            <li> It broke! But it was great while it lasted</li>
            <li> The attachment is a little tricky at first, but it worked wonders on my very thick hair! Not bad at all. BRAVO</li>
            <li> This nozzle was referred to me by my daughter.  She was right on in saying it works great!  Love it.</li>
            <li> Fits to my hairdryer, works well.</li>
            <li> Best thing I&#x27;ve ever purchased</li>
            <li> Fits onto my blowdryer when tightened. Does not slip off and the teeth of the comb are study and don&#x27;t snap off. Great purchase especially for thick black hair.</li>
            <li> Did not fit my hair dryer and it is not user friendly</li>
            <li> Love this attachment.  It gets my hair really smooth so that I only have to flat iron to style and not to straighten.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time but bag looked like it had been taped back together, it was missing the silver strap that holds it together, so I need to return. Worked with CS rep named Stacy and did all that was asked, sent pics and answered questions that were asked, this went on I had spent more time trying to get a solution and when I asked what they wanted me to never heard back from Stacy. Tossed item, what a waste.</li>
            <li> The item arrived in a timely manner. One star because it fits neither one of my blow dryers. The blow dryer it fits FOR SURE should be listed. I saw the Babyliss I think that&#x27;s the correct name of that dryer listed as a package deal, but has anyone tried to attach this attachment with success. So right now it&#x27;s useless to me. Don&#x27;t think you should have to resort to duct tape as some have done and the Solia that it might fit is expensive. Still it would be wasting more money if the Solia doesn&#x27;t fit. There are probably different models of the Solia. It would be helpful if someone would list the EXACT model and name that they attached it to.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several different brands of blow dryer combs, which didn&#x27;t stand up as being durable. My beautician recommended the Willie Morrow. I must say it&#x27;s the best blow dryer comb yet</li>
            <li> Just what I&#x27;ve been looking for and this nozzle is great, works really well. Leaves hair straight, and cuts drying time. Totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This pik is great to straighten thick curly hair. It has held up for several uses over the last few months and that&#x27;s longer than any generic I purchased in a local bss.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay have use other ones that perform better ,I find myself contuining to tighten the nozzle up a lot or it slides off. I give I a 3.</li>
            <li> Works great, didn&#x27;t give 4 stars due to the nozzle sliding off my dryer. But other than that, it works well no breaking</li>
            <li> I got this comb nozzle for straightening the hair. It comes with different rings that is SUPPOSE TO ADJUST in different hair dryer&#x27;s sizes. However It is quite difficult to unscrew it, then it didn&#x27;t fit on my hair dryer.  Besides, in one of the sides of the comb nozzle had some type of opening or something defected.  So, I just returned it. It looks nice though on the picture. But it&#x27;s not good. I guess the manufacturer needs to improve it and do a better job before selling out their products. Customers are smart... We are paying for it, so we want quality and products that truly work well.</li>
            <li> Never comes off my dryer and wasn&#x27;t too hard to attach. Makes blow drying much easier. If you&#x27;re like me then stop buying those cheap Sally attachments and get this one.</li>
            <li> unfortunately i can not use this...am so mad because it doesn&#x27;t fit on any of my three blow-driers. Now i know it warns you but seriously, my blow driers are small and it still will not fit . Now am even wondering if there is any blow drier it will fit. Am so mad. It is a sturdy product but i cant use it. Someone to tell me exactly which drier this thing fits. My hair needs this cause the combs i buy from sallies break. I don&#x27;t know why someone in their right mind would make a product that is not compatible with anything at all. I am hoping for the day when i can use this on my hair. Otherwise it rests in my waste basket with all the failed products that are too expensive to throw away but to non functional to use.</li>
            <li> This product does a good job not breaking but the thing does not stay on my blow dryer. I&#x27;m a hair stylist and I thought I was getting a good quality comb attachment but I&#x27;ve had to buy another attachment that was cheaper but is better cause it stays on the blow dryer. It&#x27;s definitely a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Do not purchase. It is poor quality junk. The insert melted within 30 seconds of attaching to hot dryer nozzle. The part was useless when heated. Unfortunately, that was the whole point of purchasing it. Duh!</li>
            <li> The inner rings were all broken and the ends of the comb to do appear to have been filed down and look very jagged around the edges. I thought that this was supposed to be a hard rubber comb, but it looks and feels like the one I can purchase at a beauty supply store except for the added metal bar that is at the base of the prongs, this could lead to extreme heat damage on the hair because it is not reported what kind of metal the bar is and how hot it can get.&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed and will be attempting to return this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent tool for getting straight hair. Hair drys in half the time. Fits many hair dryers with it&#x27;s mounting attachments.&lt;br /&gt;Best product I&#x27;ve ever used to get smooth, straight hair!!!</li>
            <li> Good concept, but the metal ring will not close once it is opened. It seems like it should be easy to slide the metal piece in and secure it with the screw but it didn&#x27;t work that way. I gave it to my husband to fix and he could not get it closed either. I returned it and emailed the seller twice and they never responded to my emails.</li>
            <li> Return policy is terrible. I went against my gut feeling and purchased even though it is not Prime... BIG MISTAKE!!! Product does not fit my blowdryer (which I would have no way of knowing prior to purchasing) and basically they are advising to return at my own risk... PLUS I have to pay to ship it back, I will not receive my shipping back AND there is a 15% restocking fee and they clearly state that they dispose of the product. Very disappointing- I could have just burned a $20 bill and gotten more enjoyment out of that.  I&#x27;m stuck with a ridiculous piece of plastic that I CANNOT USE!  Seems like it would have worked well if it fit, but oh well- maybe I&#x27;ll spend $100 on a new blow dryer so I can use this $20 piece of crap.</li>
            <li> Great tool and a must have for do-it-yourselfer&#x27;s!&lt;br /&gt;This comb attachment is also very sturdy and easy to attach. I would HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
            <li> The reason I wanted this comb was for its ability to be unbreakable.  I and my daughters are Black, and our hair is course and easily tangled after being washed.  As a result, the teeth of the combs used in the past have broken.  This comb works great and the teeth have not broken.  However, what I didn&#x27;t count on was the comb&#x27;s inability to fit well on the nozzle of my blow dryer. The nozzle, that of a Conair Infiniti Pro, is tapered and therefore does not fit well with this comb ... even with all of the inserts included in the package.</li>
            <li> I love this comb the last one lasted 10 years</li>
            <li> so glad i made this purchase</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m loving it. very well made</li>
            <li> I had no problem attaching the nozzle to my dryer. I bought a Babyliss tourmaline titanium 3000 at the same time and simply followed the directions on the Thermo Blow Nozzle and it fit perfectly. ...nice and snug with  no issues.</li>
            <li> I have a CHI dryer and it did not come with a comb attachment.  I searched for one at the CHI website with no luck.  My dryer was expensive and I did not want to buy another one just to have a comb attachment.  After some research, I decided to purchase this Willie Morrow attachement.  Once I used it for the first time, I cannot believe that I waited so long to buy it.  The results are wonderful.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Had been looking for this for years.Love it</li>
            <li> Wow is this thing great. ESPECIALLY for natural hair. Very durable and easy to use. Slips off if you don&#x27;t tighten it enough but otherwise EXCELLENT!!!</li>
            <li> The pic comb is great. I have been using now for many months; I no longer have to buy plastic pic combs from the beauty store. Delivery was prompt.</li>
            <li> I finally found an attachment for my dryer that fits. Very pleased with this product.  I wish I would have found this product sooner. Would have saved a lot of money on other attachments that did not work.</li>
            <li> Works great on any hair type especially ethnic hair. When natural it does blow out all the natural curl so for me being a hairdresser, it&#x27;s a way to work smarter and not harder</li>
            <li> Again another pik that did not fit my blow dryer (Revlon).  I will keep the pik, in case I buy another blow dryer, maybe it will fit.</li>
            <li> I have had this blow dryer attachment for a couple of months now and I am very pleased with its performance! Prior to this purchase I was replacing my comb attachment 2-3 times a year. This feels very solidly built. While I haven&#x27;t had it over a year yet, I have dropped it a couple of times and unlike the cheap ones none of the teeth broke. My only complaint is that it gets very hot when blow drying my hair, and because I am right handed sometimes if I&#x27;m not extra careful the metal screw comes in contact with my scalp when I&#x27;m doing the left side of my head. The simple solution would be to rotate the attachment 180Â° when switching sides, but by the time I switch sides the attachment is too hot to pull off or rotate with bare hands. In spite of that tiny flaw I think it performs very well.</li>
            <li> The blow dry comb doesn&#x27;t fit my hair dryer. I would hate to purchase a new hair dryer just to have a comb that fits, but i guess i will if i have to.</li>
            <li> item did not fit my blow dryer.  it is made for a blow dryer that is open at the end, my blow dryer and most blow dryers have the heating elements right at the edge of the opening.  Consequently, the attachments don&#x27;t fit.  I believe it is a great product for th right blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Initially, it confused my wife, but anyone that has used a hose clamp before will be able to figure it out. I thought it was a little bit odd that the largest adapter was still a little small for what seemed like a quite average-sized dryer nozzle, but you&#x27;ll likely be able to make it work.</li>
            <li> My story is the same as many others......original comb attachment became loose and couldn&#x27;t find a decent one in a store.  Thank goodness to Amazon and the reviewers!  I took a chance on this product and was not disappointed.  My hair is thick when wet so I was not about to toy with hair breakage by using a poorly made product.  True it looks weird and you need to use a screwdriver to attach it to the blow dryer (don&#x27;t plan on removing it once attached).  It stays on and for some reason my blow dryer seems to work better.  Thank you Willie Morrow!</li>
            <li> Thank you very much for timely delivery. The Thermo blow dry nozzle was well worth the price I paid which was $17.00 and some change. I am an black women with thick long hair which I am about 3 inches from sitting on it. Compare me with Diana Ross or Chaka Khun as far as the thickness. I have gone through many of plastic nozzles. This one is very sturdy and can handle my hair texture. Prior to finding this on amazon in which I frequently shop. I had drove around to several beauty supply locations here in Detroit asking about this attachment. I am one happy camper now. Thanks Willie Morrow who created it and Amazon for selling it. Very soon just to have an extra on hand, I will be ordering another one. :-)</li>
            <li> Looked great thought I&#x27;d love it but with first use it caused my hair blower to overheat and die.  When went to remove it found it had melted onto the nozzle of the blow dryer.</li>
            <li> The piece i use most melted...</li>
            <li> I wish the description stated this attachment is only compatible with long barrel blow dryers. It did not fit my short barrel blow dryer and I was not able to get a refund since I opened it.</li>
            <li> It does NOT fit the Babyliss blowdryer!</li>
            <li> Item works well for my dryer.  It is the only one I found that would not pop off while combing through my natural hair.  It does get hot but I just avoid touching it too much.  Works as expected.  I would recommend this item.</li>
