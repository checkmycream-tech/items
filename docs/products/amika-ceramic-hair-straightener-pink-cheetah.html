            <li>She absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron!</li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t even put too much work in straightening with a blow dryer first.</li>
            <li>Even though it is cute, pink and girly i definantly wouldnt pay the listing price, it isnt worth that much.</li>
            <li>It only takes a few seconds to heat up, so great when in a hurry.</li>
            <li>When he demonstrated on my hair in the mall he created a spiral curl from my bone straight hair in seconds.</li>
            <li>It heats up really fast.</li>
            <li>I really  like  this iron.</li>
            <li>I have had mine for two years and it is still reliable, nothing has broken or fallen apart and the temperature and heating are impeccable.</li>
            <li>For a flat iron to work properly, you should be able to close it without much pressure.</li>
            <li>to the actual flat iron, because I had used flat irons of much lower quality, I thought I would have buyers remorse when using it on my own.</li>
            <li>A new iron does not have any marks on the plates.</li>
            <li>I live in Australia.</li>
            <li>the pink cheetah print is right up my alley and starts off my day with bang!</li>
            <li>I am thrilled to see these online, because I definitely want a second one and hope to see other irons from them as well.</li>
            <li>Yes, I use a heat serum, but there have been times that I was being lazy and wanted to do something quick and it still left my hair full of sheen and bounce.</li>
            <li>This flat iron really works miracles, it straightens my hair after one time, i don&#x27;t have to keep flat ironing it over and over again just to get it straight.</li>
            <li>I pretty much use it everyday.  </li>
            <li>It takes about 30 to 40 minutes to straighten and my hair is smooth and actually helps my dead ends.</li>
            <li>The only thing I dislike about this is that it takes FOREVERRRR to cool down after use.</li>
            <li>With previous flat irons I have had to stop and wait for it to return to the right temperature.</li>
            <li>I expected a NEW item and received a USED item.</li>
            <li>Was expected that since it said being shipped new...</li>

            <li> The straightener is OK, i have long thin/ fine hair and although it does what its suppose to, it does snag my hair sometimes. Also,  my fiance paid to have it expedited so it would arrive on my birthday, but we still didnt receive it until 7 days later which was a complete waste of the extra $$. Even though it is cute, pink and girly i definantly wouldnt pay the listing price, it isnt worth that much.</li>
            <li> Great (: best straighter I ever had! Doesn&#x27;t damage my hair as the other ones!!!</li>
            <li> I did not purchase this through Amazon, but an independent sales person in a shopping mall. That said, although I did not pay full price, I would knowing what I now do. When he demonstrated on my hair in the mall he created a spiral curl from my bone straight hair in seconds. I was impressed by the shine and the low heat setting.&lt;br /&gt;On to the actual flat iron, because I had used flat irons of much lower quality, I thought I would have buyers remorse when using it on my own. I was wrong. My hair loves this flat iron. I have the cheetah print, pink, that is very cute. The design is awesome in hand and easy to use with the swivel cord. It only takes a few seconds to heat up, so great when in a hurry. It also keeps a good temperature throughout styling. With previous flat irons I have had to stop and wait for it to return to the right temperature. Not so with the Amika. I feel it is well worth the money. I have had mine for two years and it is still reliable, nothing has broken or fallen apart and the temperature and heating are impeccable. I keep it clean and in the great box it came in.&lt;br /&gt;When I use this flat iron it leaves my hair shiny, WITHOUT HAVING TO PUT OILS. Yes, I use a heat serum, but there have been times that I was being lazy and wanted to do something quick and it still left my hair full of sheen and bounce. No brittle, dull hair with ends that need to be gone over multiple times. One quick sweep and my hair is styled, every time. I am thrilled to see these online, because I definitely want a second one and hope to see other irons from them as well.</li>
            <li> The plates on the iron were scratched. I am returning this item. I expected a NEW item and received a USED item. A new iron does not have any marks on the plates. When an iron is used a build up of product shows up on the iron plates. Also the spring on the iron is a bit loose. For a flat iron to work properly, you should be able to close it without much pressure. If the plates have any spaces between them, the spring has gone bad.</li>
            <li> I love this Straightner, I got it on the day it was supposed to come (I payed extra for it to be here quicker so it better have) it came in great condition and it works beautifully. The only thing I dislike about this is that it takes FOREVERRRR to cool down after use. However I love it so I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars still. I recommend this brand because it&#x27;s the best straightner I&#x27;ve ever used and it makes my hair silky and shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> I live in Australia. I have used a GHD for about 10yrs and thought that it was the best straightener ever. Until I used the amika..... I have found my hair to be softer and more healthier. It straightens very similar to the ghd but possibly a little bit smoother. Very solid made tool, very pleased with purchase. Bought it through sfr products.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even recieved my straightener yet. It was ordered on April 28th and was supposed to be here on May 3rd, but it hasn&#x27;t come yet. And, I imagine it still won&#x27;t come until tomorrow which I believe this is unacceptable.</li>
            <li> We love this!! Me and my daughter have different texture of hair. Mine is long and wavy curly and hers is tighter curls and a little coarse. It Straightens perfectly! We don&#x27;t even put too much work in straightening with a blow dryer first. Just dry.</li>
            <li> amika products are awesome, i love how soft my haiir feels, it doesnt burn my hair, it heats fast and the print is awseome</li>
            <li> It heats up really fast. Curles my fine hair. And because of the floating heads it&#x27;s very easy on my hair. I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron! I&#x27;m still getting used to curling my hair with it, bc I&#x27;ve always used a curling iron. But I love the way it straightens! 5-10 minutes &amp; I&#x27;ve got beautiful straightened hair.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.pinterest.com/pin/255649716322691196/?fb_ref&#x3D;255649853755886055%3AzVXCQYDP2r4qwK9tpSGb</li>
            <li> Does not work, does not heat....., And worst of all I have to pay $30 to return the strightener........</li>
            <li> I bought this straightener for my girlfriend a year ago, and it still works great. She absolutely loves it! Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using mine (zebra design) for about a year and I absolutely love it.  I pretty much use it everyday.  It takes a little practice to learn how to curl and if you&#x27;re having difficulty there&#x27;s videos on youtube that can help.  The best way learn is to play around and the more you do it you&#x27;ll learn.  I also use the olive oil conditioner and I recommend that to anyone who is has frizzy and uncontrolable hair.  I&#x27;ve tried several cheaper straighteners but nothing makes my hair more shinny and smooth like Amika&#x27;s.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> i was so excited to get my straightner in the mail but when i got it in the mail the box was all ripped up and had tape all over.Was expected that since it said being shipped new... I did my hair worked pretty good but that smell the iron had (burnt/rubber smell) was horrible gave me a headache i jus hope smell wears out overall im obsesseddd with the print!</li>
            <li> This is the only flat iron my daughter will use. She had her last one for 4 yrs with no problem. Until she dropped it. So now she has the holder.</li>
            <li> MY HAIR LOOK BETTER NOW EVERYONE LOOK IT</li>
            <li> I really  like  this iron.😄</li>
            <li> Where do I begin? This flat iron really works miracles, it straightens my hair after one time, i don&#x27;t have to keep flat ironing it over and over again just to get it straight. Words can&#x27;t describe what a blessing this thing is! Please buy Amika Ceramic Hair Straightener! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> OMG! I love my amika, it straightens my hair with ease ( mind you my hair ends at the middle of back, it&#x27;s thick and naturally curly as well)! It takes about 30 to 40 minutes to straighten and my hair is smooth and actually helps my dead ends. But forget about the technical part of it. I am a cheetah freak and the pink cheetah print is right up my alley and starts off my day with bang!</li>
