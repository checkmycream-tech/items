            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>they are cool to use and many people were very impressed and thought i had gotten my nails done.</li>
            <li>A couple of my plaids came out diagonal, and I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with having some horizontal and some diagonal patterns on my nails.</li>
            <li>Great plate works good and a real plate from the konad plate company .</li>
            <li>This is one of the top konad plates, almost everyone love this one!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure with more time &amp; practice anyone can be a pro at stamping!</li>
            <li>I use an old credit card, and it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li>It works great, and creates nice crisp images.</li>
            <li>Easy!  </li>
            <li>Works great, I used this plate the first time I did nail stamping</li>
            <li>The lines are great and the images are crisp.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and turns out nicely.</li>
            <li>cute everybody loves my nails.</li>
            <li>but I am sure in time</li>
            <li>I love the Konad stamping plates.</li>
            <li>I am sure with more practice they will be easier to do.</li>
            <li>In case you&#x27;re wondering this is an authentic Konad plate.  </li>
            <li>the way my nails look can&#x27;t wait to get more plates</li>
            <li>i have seen tutorials about these saying its okay to use non konad polish for these</li>
            <li>The designs were cute.</li>
            <li>so I just use the top parts where all the dots are separate.</li>
            <li>Authentic Konad plates for a fraction of the price?</li>
            <li>but the more you practice the easier it gets</li>
            <li>Love This Plate.</li>
            <li>Love Konad products.</li>
            <li>I love the designs on this plate.</li>
            <li>I think I use the stripes the most.</li>
            <li>Likes - Fast shipping, inexpensive, great designs.</li>
            <li>It has the Konad name on it, but I&#x27;m still 90% sure its a knock-off.</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought this one.  </li>
            <li>I love the Konad stamper, scraper &amp; images.  </li>
            <li>Very detailed and beautifully cut it leaves nice deep prints</li>
            <li>Super creative way to design your nails, and very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I purchased it mainly for the argyle pattern, but I&#x27;m loving the rest as well!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this plate as most of the images are so cute.  </li>
            <li>These images are very cool and diverse.</li>
            <li>These are the best plates ive found, all the images transfer perfectly and are deep enough to transfer the whole image</li>
            <li>The designs are unique and you are able to use any polish to get the image on your nail.</li>
            <li>I was able to make great designs on the first try without much effort.</li>
            <li>I was able to get a perfect print from the little flowers on the side.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Line up is easy.</li>
            <li>but this was easy to use.</li>
            <li>:) There were 9 more words required to make this right</li>
            <li>I used O.P.I nail polish and it worked fine.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s half the price that i&#x27;ve seen on wowsocool.com :D</li>
            <li>Takes some practice to learn placement, but once you get the hang of it, it makes for some super cute nails.</li>
            <li>All designs came out very detailed and well worth adding to my collection of plates.</li>
            <li>Some of them don&#x27;t fit my nail, but I always make it work out.  </li>
            <li>I like the plate, but the one with the dots is kind of tricky to get on straight.</li>
            <li>luck and enjoy</li>
            <li>/&gt;Besides this image plate not being good for those with big nails, LOVE the Konad image stamp plates.  </li>
            <li>The designs are quite fun, and are pretty popular.</li>
            <li>it came just as shown and in it&#x27;s original package.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s konad for sure not a fake one.</li>
            <li>totally excited to start with it but have to wait til after x-mas</li>
            <li>, even the fine detail lines in the stamp are easy to clean and it stamps very, very well.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get a clean scrape with it, and all it did was scratch my plates up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve experimented with the special Konad Polishes, salon polishes (Zoya, Julep, etc), as well as department store polishes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that Zoya glitter polishes work awesomely, as do the Sally Hansen Hard as Nails polishes.</li>
            <li>&amp; they didn&#x27;t come out quite as good as the ones stamped only once.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done the paisley with three colors and it makes it look super cool.</li>
            <li>I in particular love the argyle pattern.</li>
            <li>I own about 15 of these plates, all of the Konad brand plates are of high quality and with large prints.</li>
            <li>I ordered this because I love to do my nails and try new things.</li>
            <li>So much detail and so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this nail plate and absolutely loved it at first, especially the paisley and the plaid.</li>
            <li>Very pretty designs and fun to use.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast and it was a smooth transaction.</li>
            <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t order a set of these and waste more money!</li>
            <li>The Konad m60 is such a good plate to work with for doing your whole nail with a design.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves this, and has come up with some really fun color combinations.</li>
            <li>but well worth it.</li>
            <li>This is an inexpensive and fun thing to try.</li>
            <li>They are fun to create nail art.  </li>
            <li>its worth it.</li>
            <li>They came in the original packaging with the hologram sticker and when compared side by side with a knock off, the designs are bigger and etched with more detail.  </li>
            <li>The other two designs work beautifully and it is not hard to get them on to the nails.</li>
            <li>The plaid looks really cool if you overlap two colors, more like a traditional plaid.</li>
            <li>The check design is the hardest to put on straight and to clean.</li>
            <li>Be sure to get enough polish on the image - really dab it in - and then just scrape lightly.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use special polish or else you will have limited success with the plate</li>
            <li>I got this plate because I liked every single design on it, so I will get my money worth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found that with the dot pattern, you have to work VERY fast</li>
            <li>I wish I&#x27;d known this before ordering a slew of the Konad Special polishes, but I got them cheap enough</li>
            <li>The patterns are soo pretty.</li>
            <li>Rest assured, these plates from Eos Beauty are the real deal!  </li>
            <li>This plate was EXACTLY what I needed it to be.</li>
            <li>Overall I like this plate, but need to find better polishes to use with it.</li>
            <li>gelly sandwich style (cured gel foundation, regular polish, cured gel topcoat), and then play around with the stamps on top of my cured nails.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly as it is described and it arrived within the estimated time dates.</li>
            <li>so if you find you have images that are significantly smaller than normal, either reorder or go elsewhere as they are super cute designs.</li>
            <li>I love the images on this plate so it was well worth getting as a single plate.  </li>
            <li>I have only used the plaid pattern so far (that and the argyle were my selling points on this plate), and it came out pretty nice for my first attempt at an all over pattern on my nails.</li>
            <li>They took a little trial and error to get better at it, but still very fun.</li>
            <li>I do love the designs on this plate and they are etched deeply so you do get a good, clear stamp, however, I wish they were slightly wider.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t cover the whole nail the first time, just repeat.</li>
            <li>I prefer to purchase the Konad Stamping Images because it seems they are shallow enough to get an excellent print to transfer.  </li>
            <li>is my first experience with this kind of product and it might be that my expectations were high due to the videos and comments I read about it.</li>
            <li>Easy to use with simple to follow instructions.  </li>
            <li>However, after the first time of stamping the plaid I was only able to get clear images on one of my hands.</li>
            <li>OR if Konad were to make the whole nail images wider those who are more narrow can just not paint the full width.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Real cost saver as i dont have to go to salon.</li>
            <li>This product works really well.</li>
            <li>I really like this plate.  </li>
            <li>and you have to work fast</li>
            <li>Either way, they were fast getting it out.</li>
            <li>I really like these things.  </li>
            <li>This is the real deal Konad plate</li>
            <li>very disapointed.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>They fit well on most of my nails, but are just a tiny bit too narrow for my thumbs.</li>
            <li>Pay particular attention to the direction of the design when you are rolling it onto your nails.</li>
            <li>Depth of stamp is not shallow.  </li>
            <li>Was a little surprised on how small the plate was but after trying it out am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>We had a minimal learning curve &amp; did not need to use polish remover between each nail; did it instead between each hand or foot &amp; the images came out fine; we were using OPI nail polish to stamp images with.</li>
            <li>Even with normal polish</li>
            <li>I put a clear coat of regular polish on top once I&#x27;m done, and then I can switch it out multiple times with the wear of the gel</li>
            <li>Stamping plates work best with Konad polishes as they are dark and thick and will definitely stand out.</li>
            <li>, they are much easier to stamp on your whole nail, rather than using 1 or 2 different images.</li>
            <li>but if you are not talented enough to do your own nail art and or you don&#x27;t want to pay for a manicure every week from your local salon then this is WORTH the time &amp; money!  </li>
            <li>Large enough to cover larger/wide nails.</li>
            <li>not quite wide enough for my thumb, but perfectly fine for 98% of people.</li>
            <li>Overall, when you do finally get the image onto your nail, it is really pretty!</li>
            <li>It works well and stamps a clear, unblurred edges.  </li>
            <li>Durable material and so well made, designs come out clear on my nails.</li>
            <li>that are too wide for the whole nail images, I am buying images that are not intended to cover the whole nail, like the flower on this one worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And with different colors it looks very fancy.</li>
            <li>Bought this to go with Konad Nail Art kit...perfect condition and am ready to get one in the French Manicure!</li>
            <li>These cover my entire nail(most of the time, because if you don&#x27;t line it up really well</li>
            <li>I only recently began using Konad, and this was one of the first two plates I bought (along with M36).</li>
            <li>Normally I don&#x27;t mind straying from Konad, but this plate was definitely worth the few dollars because of the stamp designs.</li>
            <li>intricate designs are sometimes harder because there is more room for error in picking up every little detail (like the paisley/plaid) but you just have to keep going until it&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Works with any type of nail polish, and I suggest using an old hotel room key card, or old gift card/credit card as the scrapper-</li>
            <li>Other then that this plate works very well!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Dislikes - Most nail polishes do not work very well with this because they are too thin and require multiple coats which is just not possible with this.</li>
            <li>These are just barely etched so the paint doesn’t go into the grooves and come out on the stamper.  </li>
            <li>a result knowing I apparently have &#x27;plus sized nails&#x27;</li>
            <li>I prefer the full nail stamping plates to the small pictures.</li>
            <li>I read other comments and was nervous about my first time using an image plate but two youtube videos later</li>
            <li>- this is such a fun little hobby.</li>
            <li>I worried about whether this was authentic konad or not when I ordered since the knock off&#x27;s are poorly made and designs are smaller than the konad ones.  </li>
            <li>These are basic enough to be professional and with a change of color could be hip enough for the hipsters.</li>
            <li>and I have to stamp at least twice to cover my full nail.  </li>
            <li>First impressions are currently not fantastic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a beginner at this, so I&#x27;ve been gravitating towards the more simplistic designs, but have really got the hold of how to do it after reading reviews on this and other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The 4 rectangular images are not wide enough for my thumb or big toe nails.  </li>
            <li>you will come back to Amazon.com to buy not only this particular Image Plate but other as well..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too bad because I really loved the designs.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The lines are great and the images are crisp.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and turns out nicely.</li>
            <li> cute everybody loves my nails.</li>
            <li> but I am sure in time</li>
            <li> I love the Konad stamping plates.</li>
            <li> I am sure with more practice they will be easier to do.</li>
            <li> In case you&#x27;re wondering this is an authentic Konad plate.  </li>
            <li> the way my nails look can&#x27;t wait to get more plates</li>
            <li> i have seen tutorials about these saying its okay to use non konad polish for these</li>
            <li> The designs were cute.</li>
            <li> so I just use the top parts where all the dots are separate.</li>
            <li> Authentic Konad plates for a fraction of the price?</li>
            <li> but the more you practice the easier it gets</li>
            <li> Love This Plate.</li>
            <li> Love Konad products.</li>
            <li> I love the designs on this plate.</li>
            <li> I think I use the stripes the most.</li>
            <li> Likes - Fast shipping, inexpensive, great designs.</li>
            <li> It has the Konad name on it, but I&#x27;m still 90% sure its a knock-off.</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought this one.  </li>
            <li> I love the Konad stamper, scraper &amp; images.  </li>
            <li> Very detailed and beautifully cut it leaves nice deep prints</li>
            <li> Super creative way to design your nails, and very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I purchased it mainly for the argyle pattern, but I&#x27;m loving the rest as well!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this plate as most of the images are so cute.  </li>
            <li> These images are very cool and diverse.</li>
            <li> These are the best plates ive found, all the images transfer perfectly and are deep enough to transfer the whole image</li>
            <li> The designs are unique and you are able to use any polish to get the image on your nail.</li>
            <li> I was able to make great designs on the first try without much effort.</li>
            <li> I was able to get a perfect print from the little flowers on the side.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Line up is easy.</li>
            <li> but this was easy to use.</li>
            <li> :) There were 9 more words required to make this right</li>
            <li> I used O.P.I nail polish and it worked fine.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s half the price that i&#x27;ve seen on wowsocool.com :D</li>
            <li> Takes some practice to learn placement, but once you get the hang of it, it makes for some super cute nails.</li>
            <li> All designs came out very detailed and well worth adding to my collection of plates.</li>
            <li> Some of them don&#x27;t fit my nail, but I always make it work out.  </li>
            <li> I like the plate, but the one with the dots is kind of tricky to get on straight.</li>
            <li> luck and enjoy</li>
            <li> /&gt;Besides this image plate not being good for those with big nails, LOVE the Konad image stamp plates.  </li>
            <li> The designs are quite fun, and are pretty popular.</li>
            <li> it came just as shown and in it&#x27;s original package.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s konad for sure not a fake one.</li>
            <li> totally excited to start with it but have to wait til after x-mas</li>
            <li> , even the fine detail lines in the stamp are easy to clean and it stamps very, very well.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get a clean scrape with it, and all it did was scratch my plates up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve experimented with the special Konad Polishes, salon polishes (Zoya, Julep, etc), as well as department store polishes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that Zoya glitter polishes work awesomely, as do the Sally Hansen Hard as Nails polishes.</li>
            <li> &amp; they didn&#x27;t come out quite as good as the ones stamped only once.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done the paisley with three colors and it makes it look super cool.</li>
            <li> I in particular love the argyle pattern.</li>
            <li> I own about 15 of these plates, all of the Konad brand plates are of high quality and with large prints.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I love to do my nails and try new things.</li>
            <li> So much detail and so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this nail plate and absolutely loved it at first, especially the paisley and the plaid.</li>
            <li> Very pretty designs and fun to use.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast and it was a smooth transaction.</li>
            <li> Glad I didn&#x27;t order a set of these and waste more money!</li>
            <li> The Konad m60 is such a good plate to work with for doing your whole nail with a design.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this, and has come up with some really fun color combinations.</li>
            <li> but well worth it.</li>
            <li> This is an inexpensive and fun thing to try.</li>
            <li> They are fun to create nail art.  </li>
            <li> its worth it.</li>
            <li> They came in the original packaging with the hologram sticker and when compared side by side with a knock off, the designs are bigger and etched with more detail.  </li>
            <li> The other two designs work beautifully and it is not hard to get them on to the nails.</li>
            <li> The plaid looks really cool if you overlap two colors, more like a traditional plaid.</li>
            <li> The check design is the hardest to put on straight and to clean.</li>
            <li> Be sure to get enough polish on the image - really dab it in - and then just scrape lightly.</li>
            <li> Make sure you use special polish or else you will have limited success with the plate</li>
            <li> I got this plate because I liked every single design on it, so I will get my money worth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found that with the dot pattern, you have to work VERY fast</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d known this before ordering a slew of the Konad Special polishes, but I got them cheap enough</li>
            <li> The patterns are soo pretty.</li>
            <li> Rest assured, these plates from Eos Beauty are the real deal!  </li>
            <li> This plate was EXACTLY what I needed it to be.</li>
            <li> Overall I like this plate, but need to find better polishes to use with it.</li>
            <li> gelly sandwich style (cured gel foundation, regular polish, cured gel topcoat), and then play around with the stamps on top of my cured nails.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly as it is described and it arrived within the estimated time dates.</li>
            <li> so if you find you have images that are significantly smaller than normal, either reorder or go elsewhere as they are super cute designs.</li>
            <li> I love the images on this plate so it was well worth getting as a single plate.  </li>
            <li> I have only used the plaid pattern so far (that and the argyle were my selling points on this plate), and it came out pretty nice for my first attempt at an all over pattern on my nails.</li>
            <li> They took a little trial and error to get better at it, but still very fun.</li>
            <li> I do love the designs on this plate and they are etched deeply so you do get a good, clear stamp, however, I wish they were slightly wider.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t cover the whole nail the first time, just repeat.</li>
            <li> I prefer to purchase the Konad Stamping Images because it seems they are shallow enough to get an excellent print to transfer.  </li>
            <li> is my first experience with this kind of product and it might be that my expectations were high due to the videos and comments I read about it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use with simple to follow instructions.  </li>
            <li> However, after the first time of stamping the plaid I was only able to get clear images on one of my hands.</li>
            <li> OR if Konad were to make the whole nail images wider those who are more narrow can just not paint the full width.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Real cost saver as i dont have to go to salon.</li>
            <li> This product works really well.</li>
            <li> I really like this plate.  </li>
            <li> and you have to work fast</li>
            <li> Either way, they were fast getting it out.</li>
            <li> I really like these things.  </li>
            <li> This is the real deal Konad plate</li>
            <li> very disapointed.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> They fit well on most of my nails, but are just a tiny bit too narrow for my thumbs.</li>
            <li> Pay particular attention to the direction of the design when you are rolling it onto your nails.</li>
            <li> Depth of stamp is not shallow.  </li>
            <li> Was a little surprised on how small the plate was but after trying it out am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> We had a minimal learning curve &amp; did not need to use polish remover between each nail; did it instead between each hand or foot &amp; the images came out fine; we were using OPI nail polish to stamp images with.</li>
            <li> Even with normal polish</li>
            <li> I put a clear coat of regular polish on top once I&#x27;m done, and then I can switch it out multiple times with the wear of the gel</li>
            <li> Stamping plates work best with Konad polishes as they are dark and thick and will definitely stand out.</li>
            <li> , they are much easier to stamp on your whole nail, rather than using 1 or 2 different images.</li>
            <li> but if you are not talented enough to do your own nail art and or you don&#x27;t want to pay for a manicure every week from your local salon then this is WORTH the time &amp; money!  </li>
            <li> Large enough to cover larger/wide nails.</li>
            <li> not quite wide enough for my thumb, but perfectly fine for 98% of people.</li>
            <li> Overall, when you do finally get the image onto your nail, it is really pretty!</li>
            <li> It works well and stamps a clear, unblurred edges.  </li>
            <li> Durable material and so well made, designs come out clear on my nails.</li>
            <li> that are too wide for the whole nail images, I am buying images that are not intended to cover the whole nail, like the flower on this one worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And with different colors it looks very fancy.</li>
            <li> Bought this to go with Konad Nail Art kit...perfect condition and am ready to get one in the French Manicure!</li>
            <li> These cover my entire nail(most of the time, because if you don&#x27;t line it up really well</li>
            <li> I only recently began using Konad, and this was one of the first two plates I bought (along with M36).</li>
            <li> Normally I don&#x27;t mind straying from Konad, but this plate was definitely worth the few dollars because of the stamp designs.</li>
            <li> intricate designs are sometimes harder because there is more room for error in picking up every little detail (like the paisley/plaid) but you just have to keep going until it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Works with any type of nail polish, and I suggest using an old hotel room key card, or old gift card/credit card as the scrapper-</li>
            <li> Other then that this plate works very well!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Dislikes - Most nail polishes do not work very well with this because they are too thin and require multiple coats which is just not possible with this.</li>
            <li> These are just barely etched so the paint doesn’t go into the grooves and come out on the stamper.  </li>
            <li> a result knowing I apparently have &#x27;plus sized nails&#x27;</li>
            <li> I prefer the full nail stamping plates to the small pictures.</li>
            <li> I read other comments and was nervous about my first time using an image plate but two youtube videos later</li>
            <li> - this is such a fun little hobby.</li>
            <li> I worried about whether this was authentic konad or not when I ordered since the knock off&#x27;s are poorly made and designs are smaller than the konad ones.  </li>
            <li> These are basic enough to be professional and with a change of color could be hip enough for the hipsters.</li>
            <li> and I have to stamp at least twice to cover my full nail.  </li>
            <li> First impressions are currently not fantastic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a beginner at this, so I&#x27;ve been gravitating towards the more simplistic designs, but have really got the hold of how to do it after reading reviews on this and other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The 4 rectangular images are not wide enough for my thumb or big toe nails.  </li>
            <li> you will come back to Amazon.com to buy not only this particular Image Plate but other as well..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad because I really loved the designs.</li>
            <li> i wish i could have two dark colors or two light colors but its hard to see</li>
            <li> and when you&#x27;re picking up the image don&#x27;t press down hard just do it lightly</li>
            <li> Etching seems too shallow in some places, and its harder to clean than advertised as nail polish often gets stuck in the deeper or finer</li>
            <li> If to short for your long nails you must stamp twice.</li>
            <li> Professional looking once you get the steps down.</li>
            <li> Konad is more expensive than other image plates</li>
            <li> I have several stamping plates and these images are significantly smaller than all of the other images plates</li>
            <li> I like all the images on this plate, but the dots and tartan check ones are very hard to get on right.</li>
            <li> Even my shorter nails are too long for it</li>
            <li> the designs are not large enough to cover my thumb.  </li>
            <li> or it will dry up on you and not work.</li>
            <li> or else the polish will dry on the image plate.</li>
            <li> and they stamp every single time.</li>
            <li> When I began stamping the second hand it seem as if the grooves had worn down because the stamp wasn&#x27;t picking up all of the detail any longer.</li>
            <li> but the designs are for people with really skinny or little nail beds!!!</li>
            <li> I have very thin, tiny fingertips, so it worked, but my thumbs were harder to get stamped right</li>
            <li> it works better to use a light polish with a dark base or a light base with a dark polish for the design.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely easier to screw an all-over design up as opposed to a little shape like a cluster of flowers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Yes, I can double stamp them but re-lining them up gets a little trick</li>
            <li> Be careful who you buy from.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money in total.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have overly wide nail beds, either, but anyone who does is going to have trouble with this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the shipping from this particular seller seems a little slow to me.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, I don&#x27;t have any problems.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews</li>
            <li> I have other stamps that aren&#x27;t the Konad brand</li>
            <li> Works well with Konad and other polishes.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re about the size you&#x27;d expect average adults to have.</li>
            <li> It can take a few tries to get all the dots of the one image to stick to the stamper, though.</li>
            <li> I just wish the images were slightly wider.  </li>
            <li> Its a little tricky getting the pattern on the nail strait</li>
            <li> A wonderfully sharp stamp for your nails, though the designs are rather thin/narrow, so if your fingers are on the larger (average) size, this might be a little difficult for you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to produce 2-3 designs and have them line up, so I end up doing something different on my thumbs or leaving them plain.</li>
            <li> Other comments also talk about the plates being too shallow, they have to be shallow or else the design would take forever to dry!</li>
            <li> The designs are a bit small for my fingers so trying to get the design on them is kinda tricky</li>
            <li> But, the images on the plate I received are way too small.  </li>
            <li> I not real big on the Konad plates because that are expensive and to small to cover my nails.</li>
            <li> I found that the razor that is supposed to be used with this product very messy.</li>
            <li> i was disappointed that the designs were unable to cover the entire nail,  particularly the thumb.</li>
            <li> Roll the stamper on hard and then roll on the nail.</li>
            <li> it was a waste of my time!!</li>
            <li> Really frustrating that the images are too small for thumbs.  </li>
            <li> while i really like theese plates with the stamp usually this one is absolutly awful, prob just going in the garbage...</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed when I got it and</li>
            <li> That way if they turn out wonky I can wipe it off with non-acetone polish remover and start again without worrying about ruining my base coat.</li>
            <li> They are so expensive for one plate!</li>
            <li> Perhaps Amazon got a bad lot</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very detailed and beautifully cut it leaves nice deep prints :) There were 9 more words required to make this right</li>
            <li> cute everybody loves my nails.Easy to use.Professional looking once you get the steps down.Real cost saver as i dont have to go to salon.</li>
            <li> This product works really well. The designs are unique and you are able to use any polish to get the image on your nail.</li>
            <li> The Konad m60 is such a good plate to work with for doing your whole nail with a design. Great plate works good and a real plate from the konad plate company .</li>
            <li> I love this image plate! Konad makes a great plate- that is really easy to use! Works with any type of nail polish, and I suggest using an old hotel room key card, or old gift card/credit card as the scrapper- it won&#x27;t scratch the metal.</li>
            <li> I found that the razor that is supposed to be used with this product very messy. I had to use a regular razor. I definitely wouldn&#x27;t do this every week or so because it is time consuming. Sometimes the image would not pick up on the stamper(I guess that&#x27;s what you call it lol). So I had to use a bit of polish until I could even pick up the image. Overall, when you do finally get the image onto your nail, it is really pretty!</li>
            <li> I own about 15 of these plates, all of the Konad brand plates are of high quality and with large prints. Large enough to cover larger/wide nails. Stamping plates work best with Konad polishes as they are dark and thick and will definitely stand out.</li>
            <li> This thing works great for me. The patterns are soo pretty. Some of them don&#x27;t fit my nail, but I always make it work out.  I found that with the dot pattern, you have to work VERY fast or it will dry up on you and not work. That&#x27;s the only one that I have problems with.</li>
            <li> Works great, I used this plate the first time I did nail stamping and my nails came out great! This is one of the top konad plates, almost everyone love this one! I used O.P.I nail polish and it worked fine.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I love to do my nails and try new things. The designs are a bit small for my fingers so trying to get the design on them is kinda tricky but I am sure in time I will get the hang of it. Other then that this plate works very well! Even with normal polish Oh yeah the stripe rite polish from Sally&#x27;s will not work it make a blurry design.</li>
            <li> I love the Konad stamping plates. I had no issues with the patterns transferring (use the Konad polish). not quite wide enough for my thumb, but perfectly fine for 98% of people. My daughter loves this, and has come up with some really fun color combinations.</li>
            <li> I have only used the plaid pattern so far (that and the argyle were my selling points on this plate), and it came out pretty nice for my first attempt at an all over pattern on my nails. It&#x27;s definitely easier to screw an all-over design up as opposed to a little shape like a cluster of flowers. Pay particular attention to the direction of the design when you are rolling it onto your nails. A couple of my plaids came out diagonal, and I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with having some horizontal and some diagonal patterns on my nails. I am sure with more practice they will be easier to do. And the quality of the KONAD brand plates is unbeatable.</li>
            <li> This image plate is wonderful &amp; in my opinion Konad is the best. Konad is more expensive than other image plates but well worth it. The seller sells these Konad image plates for cheaper than I&#x27;ve seen others for. GOOD BUY!</li>
            <li> I got this plate because I liked every single design on it, so I will get my money worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The intricate designs are sometimes harder because there is more room for error in picking up every little detail (like the paisley/plaid) but you just have to keep going until it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the designs are really beautiful though and I had no problems with my stamper not picking up images. Well made, must have!</li>
            <li> In case you&#x27;re wondering this is an authentic Konad plate.  I worried about whether this was authentic konad or not when I ordered since the knock off&#x27;s are poorly made and designs are smaller than the konad ones.  Rest assured, these plates from Eos Beauty are the real deal!  They came in the original packaging with the hologram sticker and when compared side by side with a knock off, the designs are bigger and etched with more detail.  Nice price too! :D</li>
            <li> I only recently began using Konad, and this was one of the first two plates I bought (along with M36). I love it! It took a tiny bit of getting used to, but now this is my go to plate. The designs are quite fun, and are pretty popular. I in particular love the argyle pattern. The plaid looks really cool if you overlap two colors, more like a traditional plaid. I also recommend playing with colors. I&#x27;ve done the paisley with three colors and it makes it look super cool.</li>
            <li> I like the plate, but the one with the dots is kind of tricky to get on straight. Other than that, I don&#x27;t have any problems.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  I prefer to purchase the Konad Stamping Images because it seems they are shallow enough to get an excellent print to transfer.  I look forward to future offerings and thank you for your prompt service.</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast and it was a smooth transaction. The plate works great, I recommend getting a plastic scraper because the metal one will scratch it all up. I think the only image i don&#x27;t like is the circles, they don&#x27;t transfer well for me.</li>
            <li> This plate was EXACTLY what I needed it to be. I read other comments and was nervous about my first time using an image plate but two youtube videos later and I&#x27;m stamping with the best of them! Other comments also talk about the plates being too shallow, they have to be shallow or else the design would take forever to dry! It&#x27;s a STAMP, not a bubble sticker design. Anyway, again, I&#x27;m LOVING THIS!</li>
            <li> So much detail and so easy to use.  I only wish Konad made larger \\&quot;full-size\\&quot; images.  Even my shorter nails are too long for it and I have to stamp at least twice to cover my full nail.  Other than that I love it!</li>
            <li> This is an inexpensive and fun thing to try. Be sure to get enough polish on the image - really dab it in - and then just scrape lightly. Roll the stamper on hard and then roll on the nail. If you don&#x27;t cover the whole nail the first time, just repeat. It will still look really good.</li>
            <li> I really like this plate.  The lines are great and the images are crisp.  I purchased it mainly for the argyle pattern, but I&#x27;m loving the rest as well!</li>
            <li> Nice addition to any home nail salon!  Easy to use with simple to follow instructions.  The designs look very nice on any manicure.</li>
            <li> This plate is awesome but konad plates are way overpriced. They are so expensive for one plate! Awsome but overpriced</li>
            <li> shipped in wonderful time appx. 1 week before expected&lt;br /&gt;love the way my nails look can&#x27;t wait to get more plates</li>
            <li> Really frustrating that the images are too small for thumbs.  Glad I didn&#x27;t order a set of these and waste more money!</li>
            <li> The patterns are really great! I like the bigger images, they are much easier to stamp on your whole nail, rather than using 1 or 2 different images. Pratice makes perfect, so don&#x27;t just try it once &amp; give up.</li>
            <li> i was disappointed that the designs were unable to cover the entire nail,  particularly the thumb. i have seen tutorials about these saying its okay to use non konad polish for these but maybe the engraving just wasn&#x27;t deep enough. they are cool to use and many people were very impressed and thought i had gotten my nails done. it works better to use a light polish with a dark base or a light base with a dark polish for the design. i wish i could have two dark colors or two light colors but its hard to see</li>
            <li> I purchased this nail plate and absolutely loved it at first, especially the paisley and the plaid. However, after the first time of stamping the plaid I was only able to get clear images on one of my hands. When I began stamping the second hand it seem as if the grooves had worn down because the stamp wasn&#x27;t picking up all of the detail any longer. It&#x27;s too bad because I really loved the designs.</li>
            <li> The designs were cute. And with different colors it looks very fancy. I loved the stripes and flowers  the best.</li>
            <li> it came just as shown and in it&#x27;s original package. it&#x27;s konad for sure not a fake one. some people say it doesn&#x27;t work no matter what they do but you should try different polishes and look at this site.     (...)  it&#x27;s a list of all the polishes that work with konad. and when you&#x27;re picking up the image don&#x27;t press down hard just do it lightly and it will pick up all of the image. and you have to work fast or else the polish will dry on the image plate. but over all it&#x27;s a great product and for a good price. it&#x27;s half the price that i&#x27;ve seen on wowsocool.com :D</li>
            <li> The images worked properly. I was concerned anytime I buy these Konad plates because sometimes the images don&#x27;t pick up but this one did</li>
            <li> I loveeee the konad stamping plate!  I read the other reviews and yes it can be time consuming and use quite a bit of polish but if you are not talented enough to do your own nail art and or you don&#x27;t want to pay for a manicure every week from your local salon then this is WORTH the time &amp; money!  I&#x27;m sure with more time &amp; practice anyone can be a pro at stamping! I loveee this set!</li>
            <li> stamp transfers to nails perfectly. Depth of stamp is not shallow.  If to short for your long nails you must stamp twice. Line up is easy.</li>
            <li> I like all the images on this plate, but the dots and tartan check ones are very hard to get on right. The dots image the bottom is all connected so I just use the top parts where all the dots are separate. The check design is the hardest to put on straight and to clean. The other two designs work beautifully and it is not hard to get them on to the nails.</li>
            <li> Authentic Konad plates for a fraction of the price? Yes, please! I ordered on Thursday, it was shipped on Friday &amp; I received it on Saturday! Of course the estimated arrival was Mon-Wed. Either way, they were fast getting it out. I haven&#x27;t tried the plate yet, but I can&#x27;t wait. I&#x27;d definitely order from them again.</li>
            <li> I do love the designs on this plate and they are etched deeply so you do get a good, clear stamp, however, I wish they were slightly wider.  They fit well on most of my nails, but are just a tiny bit too narrow for my thumbs. I don&#x27;t have overly wide nail beds, either, but anyone who does is going to have trouble with this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the shipping from this particular seller seems a little slow to me.  I&#x27;ve ordered from them twice and it always takes over a week to get my stuff.  Not necessarily a deal breaker, but if I can order from someone else for the same price and faster shipping, I will.</li>
            <li> Works great with the konad brand stamper &amp; scraper. Make sure you use special polish or else you will have limited success with the plate</li>
            <li> I like this plate. I prefer the full nail stamping plates to the small pictures. It can take a few tries to get all the dots of the one image to stick to the stamper, though.</li>
            <li> This kit worked well for me. No complaints! I dont have a great deal of experience with stamping and nail art but this was easy to use.</li>
            <li> This simply is not a Konad Nail Art Plate. All Konad plates have their name listed on them, this one does not. The images are much smaller and of lesser quality. Be careful who you buy from.</li>
            <li> Its a little tricky getting the pattern on the nail strait but the more you practice the easier it gets</li>
            <li> I really like these things.  They are fun to create nail art.  They took a little trial and error to get better at it, but still very fun.</li>
            <li> This is a really good quality plate.  It works well and stamps a clear, unblurred edges.  I have other stamps that aren&#x27;t the Konad brand and they aren&#x27;t as good as these.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal Konad plate but the designs are for people with really skinny or little nail beds!!!</li>
            <li> Was a little surprised on how small the plate was but after trying it out am very happy with it.  It works great, and creates nice crisp images.</li>
            <li> Bought this to go with Konad Nail Art kit...perfect condition and am ready to get one in the French Manicure!</li>
            <li> did my nails with the dotting pattern and they look so great, I like how my friends keep asking me where I got my nails done!  If you still can not make up your mind about buying this product, go to you tube type Konad Nail Art and watch some of the videos you will come back to Amazon.com to buy not only this particular Image Plate but other as well.. its worth it.</li>
            <li> Love This Plate. All designs came out very detailed and well worth adding to my collection of plates. Works well with Konad and other polishes. I am a stampaholic so I will be buying more!</li>
            <li> it was a waste of my time!! tried and tried. the nail polish wouldnt stick to the stamp. i tried different brands of polish but none worked. very disapointed.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast. Love Konad products. These images are very cool and diverse. Lots, and lots of options here. These are basic enough to be professional and with a change of color could be hip enough for the hipsters.</li>
            <li> I love the images on this plate so it was well worth getting as a single plate.  I was a little disappointed when I got it and the designs are not large enough to cover my thumb.  It&#x27;s very hard to produce 2-3 designs and have them line up, so I end up doing something different on my thumbs or leaving them plain.</li>
            <li> Super creative way to design your nails, and very easy to use.  I was able to make great designs on the first try without much effort.</li>
            <li> Very pretty designs and fun to use.  Easy!  Love all 3 plates! Good quality and great value. They don&#x27;t get scratched like others I have.  Durable material and so well made, designs come out clear on my nails.</li>
            <li> I love the designs on this plate. I think I use the stripes the most. Takes some practice to learn placement, but once you get the hang of it, it makes for some super cute nails.</li>
            <li> These cover my entire nail(most of the time, because if you don&#x27;t line it up really well then you will have gaps.) and they stamp every single time.</li>
            <li> while i really like theese plates with the stamp usually this one is absolutly awful, prob just going in the garbage...the only nail theese images are big enouh to cove would be a childs or a pinky nail.</li>
            <li> These are the best plates ive found, all the images transfer perfectly and are deep enough to transfer the whole image</li>
            <li> Likes - Fast shipping, inexpensive, great designs. Overall I like this plate, but need to find better polishes to use with it. This will require trial and error.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dislikes - Most nail polishes do not work very well with this because they are too thin and require multiple coats which is just not possible with this. Etching seems too shallow in some places, and its harder to clean than advertised as nail polish often gets stuck in the deeper or finer designs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first experience with this kind of product and it might be that my expectations were high due to the videos and comments I read about it. First impressions are currently not fantastic.</li>
            <li> I was given this plate for my birthday. Normally I don&#x27;t mind straying from Konad, but this plate was definitely worth the few dollars because of the stamp designs. A wonderfully sharp stamp for your nails, though the designs are rather thin/narrow, so if your fingers are on the larger (average) size, this might be a little difficult for you. I have very thin, tiny fingertips, so it worked, but my thumbs were harder to get stamped right and they&#x27;re about the size you&#x27;d expect average adults to have. I&#x27;m Asian, think petite and tiny, that&#x27;s my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, even the fine detail lines in the stamp are easy to clean and it stamps very, very well.</li>
            <li> The groves on the plate (for the 4 squares) that I received were almost nonexistant.  When I would use the scraper to remove excess polish, no polish would remain in the groves.  I was able to get a perfect print from the little flowers on the side.  This was a waste of money in total.  I would have not wanted this plate just for the flowers alone.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet (present for daughter) but I got it in the mail today!  totally excited to start with it but have to wait til after x-mas</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this plate as most of the images are so cute.  But, the images on the plate I received are way too small.  I have several stamping plates and these images are significantly smaller than all of the other images plates I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADDED INFO on 31 Jan 2013:  I ordered this same plate from somewhere else and the images on it are much larger than the one I received from Amazon.  Perhaps Amazon got a bad lot so if you find you have images that are significantly smaller than normal, either reorder or go elsewhere as they are super cute designs.</li>
            <li> i think i have a problem with konad i keep buying stuff and buying stuff this plate is great no cons</li>
            <li> These are just barely etched so the paint doesn’t go into the grooves and come out on the stamper.  I think it’s a knock off because it’s the only one of the Konad plates that I ordered from a different place, and the only one that doesn’t work at all.  It has the Konad name on it, but I&#x27;m still 90% sure its a knock-off.</li>
            <li> This is a good staple plate to have in your nail kit. I not real big on the Konad plates because that are expensive and to small to cover my nails. I am glad I bought this one.  The Argyle stamp made a beautiful design.  I will see if I can figure out how to post a pic later.</li>
            <li> I have to say I&#x27;m very impressed with this nail plate! I&#x27;m a beginner at this, so I&#x27;ve been gravitating towards the more simplistic designs, but have really got the hold of how to do it after reading reviews on this and other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve experimented with the special Konad Polishes, salon polishes (Zoya, Julep, etc), as well as department store polishes. I&#x27;ve found that Zoya glitter polishes work awesomely, as do the Sally Hansen Hard as Nails polishes. I wish I&#x27;d known this before ordering a slew of the Konad Special polishes, but I got them cheap enough I&#x27;ll chalk it up to a lesson learned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been also playing around with gel nails - so I&#x27;ll do my gel nails gelly sandwich style (cured gel foundation, regular polish, cured gel topcoat), and then play around with the stamps on top of my cured nails. That way if they turn out wonky I can wipe it off with non-acetone polish remover and start again without worrying about ruining my base coat. I put a clear coat of regular polish on top once I&#x27;m done, and then I can switch it out multiple times with the wear of the gel polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I would note (as others have as well), if you buy the stamping kits, don&#x27;t bother with the included scraper. I couldn&#x27;t get a clean scrape with it, and all it did was scratch my plates up. I use an old credit card, and it&#x27;s awesome. It made all the difference between polish actually sitting in the design so the stamp could be picked up, and the image being smeared all over and unusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck and enjoy - this is such a fun little hobby. All of my girlfriends now are having me practice my stamps on them, and are buying their own sets as well!</li>
            <li> I love the Konad stamper, scraper &amp; images.  I just wish the images were slightly wider.  The 4 rectangular images are not wide enough for my thumb or big toe nails.  The flower on this one was not an issue because it&#x27;s not intended to cover the entire nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I can double stamp them but re-lining them up gets a little trick &amp; they didn&#x27;t come out quite as good as the ones stamped only once.  It would be still work for those with skinny nails OR if Konad were to make the whole nail images wider those who are more narrow can just not paint the full width.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a result knowing I apparently have &#x27;plus sized nails&#x27; that are too wide for the whole nail images, I am buying images that are not intended to cover the whole nail, like the flower on this one worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides this image plate not being good for those with big nails, LOVE the Konad image stamp plates.  We had a minimal learning curve &amp; did not need to use polish remover between each nail; did it instead between each hand or foot &amp; the images came out fine; we were using OPI nail polish to stamp images with.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly as it is described and it arrived within the estimated time dates. I&#x27;ve used it once and I love it! Easy to use and turns out nicely.</li>
