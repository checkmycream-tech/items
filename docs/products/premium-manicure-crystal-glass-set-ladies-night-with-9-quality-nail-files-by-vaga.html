            <li>I am very pleased with these nail files.  </li>
            <li>I love that each one has its own protective sleeve, which is great for keeping in your purse.  </li>

            <li>Love these nail files!</li>
            <li>I had no idea how much better glass nail files are than the metal ones!  </li>
            <li>but these are the TOP!</li>
            <li>I love that they can be cleaned with warm water to restore their texture!</li>
            <li>They love them!</li>
            <li>Everyone was excited to get one and loved the great colors.</li>
            <li>They love them!</li>
            <li>These are better than any store bought glass file, and trust me I have tried a lot of them!  </li>
            <li>The files are really great and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li>These are amazing files.  </li>
            <li>I decided to just buy these because of the amazing reviews.</li>
            <li>so I always had one handy.</li>
            <li>These have come in SOOO handy since purchasing them.  </li>
            <li>Each files comes with it&#x27;s own protector sleeve which is a must have for these files.</li>
            <li>These files are nice.  </li>
            <li>The nail files are really nice.</li>
            <li>These are nice glass nail files.</li>
            <li>Each file has its own protective plastic case, and the size is convenient.</li>
            <li>The reviews were right, these files are top notch, haven&#x27;t had a problem with them breaking, and they came packaged perfectly.</li>
            <li>so you can&#x27;t really clean under the nail on the sides but works great for filing.</li>
            <li>I am a Jamberry nails consultant and use these constantly, love how they are able to be sanitized and used again and again!</li>
            <li>These work perfectly, and so far I haven&#x27;t worn a one of mine out.</li>
            <li>They are great stocking stuffers, and fit easily in my Christmas card.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE these nail files!</li>
            <li>They are superior to the Revlon glass file I tried which seemed to lose its edge quite quickly.  </li>
            <li>but that was fine considering that these files are a really nice product.</li>
            <li>I personally love them.</li>
            <li>and I love it too</li>
            <li>The crystal glass provides more comfort and a smoother edge on my nails as compared to an emery board.</li>
            <li>but I love crystal glass nail files.</li>
            <li>My elderly dad has gone thru MANY nail files as he basically uses them as a saw across his nails.</li>
            <li>Crystal files are so much better for your nails</li>
            <li>The ones I bought from Cheeky seem to work as well, but at $15 for 9 files, I can now place them in more places for convenient use and give some away to family and friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Need more words</li>
            <li>I love the Glass Nail Files.  </li>
            <li>and I received so many.</li>
            <li>Love the files.  </li>
            <li>I shared with friends and family, and they were pleased as well.</li>
            <li>and they love them.  </li>
            <li>Mostly want them for gift pack for my hostess, at my Jamberry Nail Parties.  </li>
            <li>I love these files.  </li>
            <li>I love them.  </li>
            <li>I love the glass files.</li>
            <li>I love them for filing</li>
            <li>-- I wish they were more durable, or came in a more durable container.</li>
            <li>Love these.  </li>
            <li>I must say that when I got the product that I was completely satisfied with how they looked.</li>
            <li>I love crystal files and they always go through the scanner at the airport with no problem.  </li>
            <li>Will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>My co-workers all enjoyed them.  </li>
            <li>and then those I gave them to wanted to know where to get more.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found the cheeky nail files.  </li>
            <li>I am sure I will be purchasing these again soon</li>
            <li>This particular package is a really great value.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really loving these, and since they seem to never dull, it turns out I didn&#x27;t need so many!</li>
            <li>They leave a very smooth clean edge on your nail.</li>
            <li>They are so smooth when they are filing nails, without any of the catching and leaving rough patches I have experienced using metal files.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t beat the price, seals in the nail as you file it down, so nails don&#x27;t split, make the greatest gifts, too</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and they make the tips of your nails so smooth.  </li>
            <li>They work just fine for guys, too.</li>
            <li>Very pretty!</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of crystal nail files.</li>
            <li>These are fabulous.</li>
            <li>Filing them to a smooth finish at the tips has always been a challenge.</li>
            <li>Also, unlike cheap emery boards, they never slice into the skin around my nails.</li>
            <li>I started to give them out to friends since they liked them so much when I did their nails.</li>
            <li>Very well packaged with nice plastic sleeves for each crystal file.  </li>
            <li>Product is as advertised, does nails efficiently, attractive, having several is a plus, meaning I keep one in my  purse, by the tv, in my desk, etc.</li>
            <li>I am planning on gifting many of my friends for Christmas with the extras that I have, hopefully they will enjoy them as much as I have!</li>
            <li>highly recommend these to anyone who takes care of their own nails.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering 21 more because I&#x27;m opening a little shop to offer off-beat items for great prices and know these will be huge successes.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the buy over all!</li>
            <li>will give some out for Christmas, birthdays, or just for fun!</li>
            <li>bought my first one at a museum in Santa Fee and was very excited</li>
            <li>This were great as bridal shower gifts - love the color options &amp; I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever be able to go back to traditional nail files.</li>
            <li>I got a large variety of colors and received so many files I can keep one in my nightstand,</li>
            <li>Having purchased ALOT of nail files over the years, when I saw these a month or so ago, I couldn&#x27;t resist ordering them--even if only the price ended up being a good deal</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get professional manis or pedis but do like to have nice looking nails.</li>
            <li>and then I found them much more reasonable on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I tried  crystal nail files several years ago when I came upon them at a craft fair.</li>
            <li>These are much more gentle on nails and work quickly without snags.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast, and I love all the colors that arrived.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pretty, and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>(that wear out so quickly) or metal files again.</li>
            <li>I like the texture and their sharpness at the tip for helping clean under the nails as well as having the fine grain to gently file the nails.</li>
            <li>All of the nail files have their own individual plastic covering which helps keep the file clean from being stowed in a purse or pen holder.</li>
            <li>An added bonus is that they are pretty!</li>
            <li>I have bought these before and give them to family members who come back to me for more!  </li>
            <li>Plus, they are so economical.</li>
            <li>My friend gave me one of these nice crystal files as a gift last year.</li>
            <li>They are definitely useful</li>
            <li>They are very fine grit and only take a quick rinse to wash away the remainig nail dust.  </li>
            <li>These are great little presents to give and to have on hand!</li>
            <li>My only wish was that they were a little thinner, but otherwise a great product!</li>
            <li>They have remained sharp, and I love being able to wash them off after using them so that they&#x27;re just like new!</li>
            <li>: can leave a smooth edge, long lasting, easy to clean, very reasonable price, delivered pretty quickly, safely packaged&lt;br /&gt;Con: can break if dropped on a hard surface, marketing directed toward women (guys need good manicure tools too)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these to anyone with hard-to-file nails.</li>
            <li>Good for little gifts.</li>
            <li>I wanted a couple more to keep in various places around the house</li>
            <li>Given the price it&#x27;s an ok nail file, but if you are looking for a crystal nail file that will  last forever, keep looking.</li>
            <li>They last a long time and do a great job.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already given away 6 of my first order of files.</li>
            <li>so well filing that I no longer have to clip the nails first.</li>
            <li>IMHO, these work a lot better than the traditional nail file.  </li>
            <li>FIRST - UNDERSTAND</li>
            <li>I will buy again, but I don&#x27;t think it will be for a while ;)</li>
            <li>As always, the price was higher than I was willing to pay, so I looked on-line.  </li>
            <li>I love my ancient glass nail file, and now I can keep spare files wherever I may need one:  car, work, and several around the house.</li>
            <li>I have given away most of mine that I recently bought for Christmas presents!</li>
            <li>I got my first crystal nail file at a craft fair while on vacation in Florida last December and the seller guaranteed it would last forever</li>
            <li>I have never found a file any better and was upset when I broke my first one and looked a long time before I found these.  </li>
            <li>and I have used one multiple times already and the file is still going strong.</li>
            <li>Shipping was a bit slow but worth the wait &amp; will buy more!</li>
            <li>Very high quality, &amp;  </li>
            <li>For personal use, running under hot water is all you need to clean them.</li>
            <li>Crystal files can leave a smooth finish or take more material depending on how hard you press.</li>
            <li>My nails are so much smoother and no splitting or snags.  </li>
            <li>They do not seem to lose their grit regardless if how much punishment they get.</li>
            <li>These are so much stronger</li>
            <li>Everybody preferred these glass files--they give such a smooth finish to the edge of your finger nail.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never broken one, but it&#x27;s claimed that they don&#x27;t splinter</li>
            <li>This are so gentle on my nails.  </li>
            <li>I really like these glass files.</li>
            <li>The sleeves they come in aren&#x27;t really protective at all.</li>
            <li>These appear to be tempered glass, chemically etched to a medium-fine, very uniform abrasive grit.</li>
            <li>The grit is very fine, but if you need to file your nails down significantly this totally does the job.  </li>
            <li>I purchased  these nail files hoping they would be similar to my original purchase, but they are not.</li>
            <li>I really liked them and they lasted a long time before they finally broke.</li>
            <li>I have a glass nail file that I&#x27;ve used for over 10 years and it still works like its brand new!</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I love the packaged set of these that I could give out as little gifts over the holidays.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve lasted me nearly 10 months; I&#x27;m getting ready to re-order.</li>
            <li>My husband took off with the lime green one, his favorite color.</li>
            <li>Look nice &amp; file nail alright, but they are too thick to get under your nail or at the corners of your nails</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t gone smooth like other glass nail files I have used.</li>
            <li>So it will be a new experience for them.  </li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>I purchase a small amount and then reordered more than twice the amount to give with Christmas gifts.  </li>
            <li>even though tjeu take a long time to get here, they&#x27;re well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>I have never had one break, so far.  </li>
            <li>and they are the same quality at much lower price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They also last much longer than emery boards or the buffers.</li>
            <li>I have natural nails</li>
            <li>So far I have one in my purse, one at the office, one in the car, one in my nightstand and one in my home office.  </li>
            <li>Even &#x27;professional&#x27; nail files from a Beauty Supply can&#x27;t compare with these.</li>
            <li>It takes a little while for the shipping, but worth the wait!</li>
            <li>You seriously cannot have too many of these.  </li>
            <li>and I have used many files that were rough and left my nails dangerously sharp or damaged and ragged.</li>
            <li>These work like no other, so always look for the ones with Cheeky on them.</li>
            <li>Foam-type buffers work well, but take forever, are hard to clean and need to be discarded too frequently.</li>
            <li>I have dropped and broken so many that I needed a bundle to replace them at home, at work &amp; in car too.</li>
            <li>However, they are really nice nail files and since I hate using nail files because of the way they weaken my nails, I found these ones do well without causing more problems than when I began, which was often the case with the other ones.</li>
            <li>The classic metal file and emery boards are too coarse and leave the edges rough.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed since using them my nails grow so much healthier with less breakage.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I thought that the price was really good for nine files.</li>
            <li> Cheeky products are top of the line and at a great price.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with these nail files.  </li>
            <li> I love that each one has its own protective sleeve, which is great for keeping in your purse.  </li>
            <li> The price was very reasonable but the quality was excellent.</li>
            <li> Love these nail files!</li>
            <li> I had no idea how much better glass nail files are than the metal ones!  </li>
            <li> but these are the TOP!</li>
            <li> I love that they can be cleaned with warm water to restore their texture!</li>
            <li> They love them!</li>
            <li> Everyone was excited to get one and loved the great colors.</li>
            <li> They love them!</li>
            <li> These are better than any store bought glass file, and trust me I have tried a lot of them!  </li>
            <li> The files are really great and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> These are amazing files.  </li>
            <li> I decided to just buy these because of the amazing reviews.</li>
            <li> so I always had one handy.</li>
            <li> These have come in SOOO handy since purchasing them.  </li>
            <li> Each files comes with it&#x27;s own protector sleeve which is a must have for these files.</li>
            <li> These files are nice.  </li>
            <li> The nail files are really nice.</li>
            <li> These are nice glass nail files.</li>
            <li> Each file has its own protective plastic case, and the size is convenient.</li>
            <li> The reviews were right, these files are top notch, haven&#x27;t had a problem with them breaking, and they came packaged perfectly.</li>
            <li> so you can&#x27;t really clean under the nail on the sides but works great for filing.</li>
            <li> I am a Jamberry nails consultant and use these constantly, love how they are able to be sanitized and used again and again!</li>
            <li> These work perfectly, and so far I haven&#x27;t worn a one of mine out.</li>
            <li> They are great stocking stuffers, and fit easily in my Christmas card.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE these nail files!</li>
            <li> They are superior to the Revlon glass file I tried which seemed to lose its edge quite quickly.  </li>
            <li> but that was fine considering that these files are a really nice product.</li>
            <li> I personally love them.</li>
            <li> and I love it too</li>
            <li> The crystal glass provides more comfort and a smoother edge on my nails as compared to an emery board.</li>
            <li> but I love crystal glass nail files.</li>
            <li> My elderly dad has gone thru MANY nail files as he basically uses them as a saw across his nails.</li>
            <li> Crystal files are so much better for your nails</li>
            <li> The ones I bought from Cheeky seem to work as well, but at $15 for 9 files, I can now place them in more places for convenient use and give some away to family and friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Need more words</li>
            <li> I love the Glass Nail Files.  </li>
            <li> and I received so many.</li>
            <li> Love the files.  </li>
            <li> I shared with friends and family, and they were pleased as well.</li>
            <li> and they love them.  </li>
            <li> Mostly want them for gift pack for my hostess, at my Jamberry Nail Parties.  </li>
            <li> I love these files.  </li>
            <li> I love them.  </li>
            <li> I love the glass files.</li>
            <li> I love them for filing</li>
            <li> -- I wish they were more durable, or came in a more durable container.</li>
            <li> Love these.  </li>
            <li> I must say that when I got the product that I was completely satisfied with how they looked.</li>
            <li> I love crystal files and they always go through the scanner at the airport with no problem.  </li>
            <li> Will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> My co-workers all enjoyed them.  </li>
            <li> and then those I gave them to wanted to know where to get more.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found the cheeky nail files.  </li>
            <li> I am sure I will be purchasing these again soon</li>
            <li> This particular package is a really great value.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really loving these, and since they seem to never dull, it turns out I didn&#x27;t need so many!</li>
            <li> They leave a very smooth clean edge on your nail.</li>
            <li> They are so smooth when they are filing nails, without any of the catching and leaving rough patches I have experienced using metal files.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t beat the price, seals in the nail as you file it down, so nails don&#x27;t split, make the greatest gifts, too</li>
            <li> They are easy to use and they make the tips of your nails so smooth.  </li>
            <li> They work just fine for guys, too.</li>
            <li> Very pretty!</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of crystal nail files.</li>
            <li> These are fabulous.</li>
            <li> Filing them to a smooth finish at the tips has always been a challenge.</li>
            <li> Also, unlike cheap emery boards, they never slice into the skin around my nails.</li>
            <li> I started to give them out to friends since they liked them so much when I did their nails.</li>
            <li> Very well packaged with nice plastic sleeves for each crystal file.  </li>
            <li> Product is as advertised, does nails efficiently, attractive, having several is a plus, meaning I keep one in my  purse, by the tv, in my desk, etc.</li>
            <li> I am planning on gifting many of my friends for Christmas with the extras that I have, hopefully they will enjoy them as much as I have!</li>
            <li> highly recommend these to anyone who takes care of their own nails.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering 21 more because I&#x27;m opening a little shop to offer off-beat items for great prices and know these will be huge successes.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the buy over all!</li>
            <li> will give some out for Christmas, birthdays, or just for fun!</li>
            <li> bought my first one at a museum in Santa Fee and was very excited</li>
            <li> This were great as bridal shower gifts - love the color options &amp; I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever be able to go back to traditional nail files.</li>
            <li> I got a large variety of colors and received so many files I can keep one in my nightstand,</li>
            <li> Having purchased ALOT of nail files over the years, when I saw these a month or so ago, I couldn&#x27;t resist ordering them--even if only the price ended up being a good deal</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get professional manis or pedis but do like to have nice looking nails.</li>
            <li> and then I found them much more reasonable on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I tried  crystal nail files several years ago when I came upon them at a craft fair.</li>
            <li> These are much more gentle on nails and work quickly without snags.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast, and I love all the colors that arrived.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty, and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> (that wear out so quickly) or metal files again.</li>
            <li> I like the texture and their sharpness at the tip for helping clean under the nails as well as having the fine grain to gently file the nails.</li>
            <li> All of the nail files have their own individual plastic covering which helps keep the file clean from being stowed in a purse or pen holder.</li>
            <li> An added bonus is that they are pretty!</li>
            <li> I have bought these before and give them to family members who come back to me for more!  </li>
            <li> Plus, they are so economical.</li>
            <li> My friend gave me one of these nice crystal files as a gift last year.</li>
            <li> They are definitely useful</li>
            <li> They are very fine grit and only take a quick rinse to wash away the remainig nail dust.  </li>
            <li> These are great little presents to give and to have on hand!</li>
            <li> My only wish was that they were a little thinner, but otherwise a great product!</li>
            <li> They have remained sharp, and I love being able to wash them off after using them so that they&#x27;re just like new!</li>
            <li> : can leave a smooth edge, long lasting, easy to clean, very reasonable price, delivered pretty quickly, safely packaged&lt;br /&gt;Con: can break if dropped on a hard surface, marketing directed toward women (guys need good manicure tools too)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these to anyone with hard-to-file nails.</li>
            <li> Good for little gifts.</li>
            <li> I wanted a couple more to keep in various places around the house</li>
            <li> Given the price it&#x27;s an ok nail file, but if you are looking for a crystal nail file that will  last forever, keep looking.</li>
            <li> They last a long time and do a great job.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already given away 6 of my first order of files.</li>
            <li> so well filing that I no longer have to clip the nails first.</li>
            <li> IMHO, these work a lot better than the traditional nail file.  </li>
            <li> FIRST - UNDERSTAND</li>
            <li> I will buy again, but I don&#x27;t think it will be for a while ;)</li>
            <li> As always, the price was higher than I was willing to pay, so I looked on-line.  </li>
            <li> I love my ancient glass nail file, and now I can keep spare files wherever I may need one:  car, work, and several around the house.</li>
            <li> I have given away most of mine that I recently bought for Christmas presents!</li>
            <li> I got my first crystal nail file at a craft fair while on vacation in Florida last December and the seller guaranteed it would last forever</li>
            <li> I have never found a file any better and was upset when I broke my first one and looked a long time before I found these.  </li>
            <li> and I have used one multiple times already and the file is still going strong.</li>
            <li> Shipping was a bit slow but worth the wait &amp; will buy more!</li>
            <li> Very high quality, &amp;  </li>
            <li> For personal use, running under hot water is all you need to clean them.</li>
            <li> Crystal files can leave a smooth finish or take more material depending on how hard you press.</li>
            <li> My nails are so much smoother and no splitting or snags.  </li>
            <li> They do not seem to lose their grit regardless if how much punishment they get.</li>
            <li> These are so much stronger</li>
            <li> Everybody preferred these glass files--they give such a smooth finish to the edge of your finger nail.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never broken one, but it&#x27;s claimed that they don&#x27;t splinter</li>
            <li> This are so gentle on my nails.  </li>
            <li> I really like these glass files.</li>
            <li> The sleeves they come in aren&#x27;t really protective at all.</li>
            <li> These appear to be tempered glass, chemically etched to a medium-fine, very uniform abrasive grit.</li>
            <li> The grit is very fine, but if you need to file your nails down significantly this totally does the job.  </li>
            <li> I purchased  these nail files hoping they would be similar to my original purchase, but they are not.</li>
            <li> I really liked them and they lasted a long time before they finally broke.</li>
            <li> I have a glass nail file that I&#x27;ve used for over 10 years and it still works like its brand new!</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love the packaged set of these that I could give out as little gifts over the holidays.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve lasted me nearly 10 months; I&#x27;m getting ready to re-order.</li>
            <li> My husband took off with the lime green one, his favorite color.</li>
            <li> Look nice &amp; file nail alright, but they are too thick to get under your nail or at the corners of your nails</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t gone smooth like other glass nail files I have used.</li>
            <li> So it will be a new experience for them.  </li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> I purchase a small amount and then reordered more than twice the amount to give with Christmas gifts.  </li>
            <li> even though tjeu take a long time to get here, they&#x27;re well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I have never had one break, so far.  </li>
            <li> and they are the same quality at much lower price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They also last much longer than emery boards or the buffers.</li>
            <li> I have natural nails</li>
            <li> So far I have one in my purse, one at the office, one in the car, one in my nightstand and one in my home office.  </li>
            <li> Even &#x27;professional&#x27; nail files from a Beauty Supply can&#x27;t compare with these.</li>
            <li> It takes a little while for the shipping, but worth the wait!</li>
            <li> You seriously cannot have too many of these.  </li>
            <li> and I have used many files that were rough and left my nails dangerously sharp or damaged and ragged.</li>
            <li> These work like no other, so always look for the ones with Cheeky on them.</li>
            <li> Foam-type buffers work well, but take forever, are hard to clean and need to be discarded too frequently.</li>
            <li> I have dropped and broken so many that I needed a bundle to replace them at home, at work &amp; in car too.</li>
            <li> However, they are really nice nail files and since I hate using nail files because of the way they weaken my nails, I found these ones do well without causing more problems than when I began, which was often the case with the other ones.</li>
            <li> The classic metal file and emery boards are too coarse and leave the edges rough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed since using them my nails grow so much healthier with less breakage.</li>
            <li> Using the pink emery boards available at drugstores for anywhere between $1 adn $2 each, he will sometimes wear out all the usable sandpaper grit in just one sawing--I mean filing.</li>
            <li> I have paid as much as $10 for one of these files in the past.</li>
            <li> These files last about as long as an emery board.</li>
            <li> They last a long time, unless you drop them.</li>
            <li> so they last a long, long time, even when used as a carpenter&#x27;s tool!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other, more expensive, crystal files</li>
            <li> I would have had to return the whole set in order to replace one, not worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> I love glass files for my thin nails, it doesn&#x27;t destroy them!</li>
            <li> (my nails have peeled / chipped a lot less) but they are definitely not something you can throw in your purse for on the go filing.</li>
            <li> I have been buying them for a little over a year now and picked my last file up at a drug store.</li>
            <li> I gave these to as a little present for Mother&#x27;s Day</li>
            <li> Paper/plastic types wear out and become flimsy after only a few rounds of filing nails.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried the quality yet since I got it for other people as part of their Xmas gift.</li>
            <li> I never use nail clippers, but instead use a nail file every other day to take off growth.  </li>
            <li> These on the otherhand are as sharp as when I opened the package.  </li>
            <li> My nails are thin, have ridges (which further weaken them) and can sometimes actually tear rather than break.</li>
            <li> I have also given one to my sister and I still have extras to replace if any misfortunes happen like one breaks in my bag or one wears down.</li>
            <li> folks might notice that this brand has a slightly rougher grain than pricier ones, but having owned both types, I can truly say that it doesn&#x27;t make a difference.</li>
            <li> The file surface takes a little getting used to but works well.</li>
            <li> and they wore out within a few filings</li>
            <li> Because they were being shipped directly from China, they took forever to arrive and also the shipping was outrageously expensive.  </li>
            <li> I have hed these for a few months now and still no complaints.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money that was!</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t seem to dull.  </li>
            <li> They are a bit thick</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also quite durable, as none of us have broken them since acquiring them almost a year ago.  </li>
            <li> I bought this pack of (9, I think?) and gave them out with Christmas gifts to my mom, cousin, secret Santa giftee, etc.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve broken like three of these</li>
            <li> The reason I give 4 instead of 5 stars is because they were packaged very poorly and one broke during shipping.</li>
            <li> It was terrible quality and dulled in less than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> BAD CHOICE.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> My nails are so much smoother and no splitting or snags.  After just one week I can tell a big difference. Love these nail files!</li>
            <li> Gave to friends as Xmas stocking stuffers.  They seemed to like them and none of them, ten ladies, had ever used glass nail files.  So it will be a new experience for them.  I personally love them.</li>
            <li> My hubby bought these to use as Christmas presents.  Everyone loved them!  I have one and I love it too, it doesn&#x27;t tear up your nail like a metal file.  They are really nice!</li>
            <li> I got my first crystal nail file at a craft fair while on vacation in Florida last December and the seller guaranteed it would last forever or she would replace it.  I was so impressed with how well it worked I wanted a couple more to keep in various places around the house so I always had one handy. I purchased  these nail files hoping they would be similar to my original purchase, but they are not. These files last about as long as an emery board. Given the price it&#x27;s an ok nail file, but if you are looking for a crystal nail file that will  last forever, keep looking.</li>
            <li> These files are durable. I have used them over and over for a year and they are still holding up great. The crystal glass provides more comfort and a smoother edge on my nails as compared to an emery board.</li>
            <li> I had no idea how much better glass nail files are than the metal ones!  We sell these at work, and I finally tried one.  WOW!  They are so smooth when they are filing nails, without any of the catching and leaving rough patches I have experienced using metal files.  These never seem to wear downâ€¦I have been using one for over a year with great results.  I have never had one break, so far.  I will never go back to the emery boards (that wear out so quickly) or metal files again.</li>
            <li> My MIL gave me one of these for Christmas about 3 years ago. I LOVED LOVED it! About a week or so ago I broke it and was upset thinking I was going to drop $15 on another. This 9 pack is AWESOME! One at work, home, car, etc. If another breaks no biggie. But now that I&#x27;m not carrying it with me 24/7 they shouldn&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried the quality yet since I got it for other people as part of their Xmas gift. The one left over I will test out but I love crystal glass nail files. I&#x27;ve noticed since using them my nails grow so much healthier with less breakage.</li>
            <li> I bought crystal file from another brand with a case and loved it.&lt;br /&gt;Needed some back-ups so ordered these and they are the same quality at much lower price.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these to anyone who takes care of their own nails.&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the must haves for nail care.</li>
            <li> These are awesome!  They last a long time and do a great job.  Bought others like them but they don&#x27;t compare at all.  Cheeky products are top of the line and at a great price.  Best nail files I have ever owned.  I never use nail clippers, but instead use a nail file every other day to take off growth.  These work like no other, so always look for the ones with Cheeky on them.</li>
            <li> LOVE THESE FILES!!!!!  Having purchased ALOT of nail files over the years, when I saw these a month or so ago, I couldn&#x27;t resist ordering them--even if only the price ended up being a good deal and they wore out within a few filings, I felt I would still have saved money by getting 14 of them. I don&#x27;t get professional manis or pedis but do like to have nice looking nails. I&#x27;ve used other, more expensive, crystal files but these are the TOP! They do not seem to lose their grit regardless if how much punishment they get. My elderly dad has gone thru MANY nail files as he basically uses them as a saw across his nails. Using the pink emery boards available at drugstores for anywhere between $1 adn $2 each, he will sometimes wear out all the usable sandpaper grit in just one sawing--I mean filing. These are so much stronger so they last a long, long time, even when used as a carpenter&#x27;s tool! I&#x27;m ordering 21 more because I&#x27;m opening a little shop to offer off-beat items for great prices and know these will be huge successes. I&#x27;ve already given away 6 of my first order of files. Don&#x27;t hesitate to get these wonderful files. Keep one in each purse, in your car, your bedroom, kitchen, living room......you get the idea.</li>
            <li> These files are amazing! I am a Jamberry nails consultant and use these constantly, love how they are able to be sanitized and used again and again! Great value too!</li>
            <li> These were a hit at Christmas. I gave one to each lady on my gift list. Another lady in our group had the same idea-except she handed out the spongy-type nail files. Everybody preferred these glass files--they give such a smooth finish to the edge of your finger nail.</li>
            <li> These are amazing files.  They are etched on both sides to provide plenty of filing surface. It takes a little while for the shipping, but worth the wait!</li>
            <li> These have come in SOOO handy since purchasing them.  Not only have I used them often, but I&#x27;ve given them away to friends and family too.  They&#x27;re pretty, and easy to use.  They&#x27;re also quite durable, as none of us have broken them since acquiring them almost a year ago.  They have remained sharp, and I love being able to wash them off after using them so that they&#x27;re just like new!</li>
            <li> Unlike some files, this does not have a coating of sand spray painted on so they don&#x27;t seem to dull.  I&#x27;m really loving these, and since they seem to never dull, it turns out I didn&#x27;t need so many!</li>
            <li> These are fabulous. Crystal files are so much better for your nails and these are a great buy! The package of 9 is a great price for using as gifts/stocking stuffers. They&#x27;re sleek, great colors and come in a nice protective sleeve.</li>
            <li> This type of file is the best I&#x27;ve found for problem fingernails. My nails are thin, have ridges (which further weaken them) and can sometimes actually tear rather than break. Filing them to a smooth finish at the tips has always been a challenge. The classic metal file and emery boards are too coarse and leave the edges rough. Foam-type buffers work well, but take forever, are hard to clean and need to be discarded too frequently. Crystal files can leave a smooth finish or take more material depending on how hard you press. They also last much longer than emery boards or the buffers. For personal use, running under hot water is all you need to clean them. I&#x27;ve never broken one, but it&#x27;s claimed that they don&#x27;t splinter if dropped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously, I bought a crystal file for about $6. The ones I bought from Cheeky seem to work as well, but at $15 for 9 files, I can now place them in more places for convenient use and give some away to family and friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: can leave a smooth edge, long lasting, easy to clean, very reasonable price, delivered pretty quickly, safely packaged&lt;br /&gt;Con: can break if dropped on a hard surface, marketing directed toward women (guys need good manicure tools too)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these to anyone with hard-to-file nails.</li>
            <li> Wife says they are great so I am passing that along...these are great...there...done. Need more words so you get 9 great files.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of crystal nail files. They leave a very smooth clean edge on your nail. Also, unlike cheap emery boards, they never slice into the skin around my nails. This set is an excellent value. I have paid as much as $10 for one of these files in the past. The reason I give 4 instead of 5 stars is because they were packaged very poorly and one broke during shipping. I would have had to return the whole set in order to replace one, not worth the trouble. Definitely worth the buy over all!</li>
            <li> Best nail files!  They never wear out.  I keep them everywhere...multiple places in my house, in the car and one in my purse which I keep in a travel toothbrush holder to avoid it from breaking in my purse.  I started to give them out to friends since they liked them so much when I did their nails.</li>
            <li> The price was very reasonable but the quality was excellent. I keep 1 in each car, in the kitchen, bedroom office etc.</li>
            <li> They are not that great. Look nice &amp; file nail alright, but they are too thick to get under your nail or at the corners of your nails</li>
            <li> These are much more gentle on nails and work quickly without snags.  An added bonus is that they are pretty!</li>
            <li> I love the Glass Nail Files.  This are so gentle on my nails.  I have different colors around the house.  They work really good and all you do is wipe them off.</li>
            <li> I purchase a small amount and then reordered more than twice the amount to give with Christmas gifts.  I have never found a file any better and was upset when I broke my first one and looked a long time before I found these.  Everyone that I hav given one to has loved them.  Works so well filing that I no longer have to clip the nails first.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE these nail files! I love that they can be cleaned with warm water to restore their texture! I gave them to all my friends! Shipping was a bit slow but worth the wait &amp; will buy more!</li>
            <li> I really like these glass files. They last a long time, unless you drop them. They are glass after all. But they do not splinter.&lt;br /&gt;I bought my first one at a museum in Santa Fee and was very excited and then I found them much more reasonable on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I tried  crystal nail files several years ago when I came upon them at a craft fair. I really liked them and they lasted a long time before they finally broke. I was happy to come across these files on Amazon. I got a large variety of colors and received so many files I can keep one in my nightstand, my desk drawer, my purse, the bathroom, etc. Plenty of files. They work nicely and this was a great deal for the number of files I received. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great quality. I give these to friends all time because they&#x27;re awesome and I received so many. You&#x27;ll never use another file after these.</li>
            <li> I was given a crystal file 3 years ago and have never used another type since. These are excellent for keeping nail tips smooth and healthy, and perfect for air travel since these pass rigorous security and you can carry the crystal file in your purse. I also don&#x27;t mind sharing mine with others since they wash well with soap and water and show no signs of wear &amp; tear.  I keep one in my purse, one in each bathroom, and give them as gifts.  Great product at a great price. The size is the same as a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; nail file..&lt;br /&gt;Some folks might notice that this brand has a slightly rougher grain than pricier ones, but having owned both types, I can truly say that it doesn&#x27;t make a difference. This works just as well as finer/smoother files.</li>
            <li> Love the files.  Enough to share with friends.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with these nail files.  They are superior to the Revlon glass file I tried which seemed to lose its edge quite quickly.  These on the otherhand are as sharp as when I opened the package.  They are very fine grit and only take a quick rinse to wash away the remainig nail dust.  I have given a couple to several family members.  I would definitely buy these again.</li>
            <li> These are really good nail files. This is my second order...I give them to everyone! Not like the useless one I bought at Walgreen&#x27;s, that&#x27;s for sure. What a waste of money that was! These work perfectly, and so far I haven&#x27;t worn a one of mine out. I have one everywhere I can think of...beside my computer, my bed, the bathroom, my purse, my car, etc.</li>
            <li> These are the best nail files!  I love them!!</li>
            <li> These were just a great price and a wonderful product.  I shared with friends and family, and they were pleased as well. Thank You</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t beat the price, seals in the nail as you file it down, so nails don&#x27;t split, make the greatest gifts, too</li>
            <li> These nail files are awesome.  Once you use these, you will never want to go back to the traditional nail file.  I gave all but two of them away to friends and family and they love them.  IMHO, these work a lot better than the traditional nail file.  Plus, they are so economical.</li>
            <li> FIRST - UNDERSTAND IT WILL TAKE A MONTH TO GET THEM because they are coming from overseas..china or something I believe. However they are excellent, I got a notification saying they would be delivered in like 5-7 days but that must have been an autogenerated mistake. The files are really great and easy to maintain. Each files comes with it&#x27;s own protector sleeve which is a must have for these files. Otherwise your file will scratch anything else...glasses/sunglasses, change purse latch/metal, etc.</li>
            <li> My friend gave me one of these nice crystal files as a gift last year. They are really nice!  So, I ordered some for Christmas stocking stuffers this year. Shipping was super fast, and I love all the colors that arrived. Very well packaged with nice plastic sleeves for each crystal file.  I&#x27;ll never buy emery board files again.  What a bargain too!</li>
            <li> Crystal nail files are wonderful and every time I use them I wonder how I ever lived without them. I bought this pack of (9, I think?) and gave them out with Christmas gifts to my mom, cousin, secret Santa giftee, etc. They love them!</li>
            <li> I love the packaged set of these that I could give out as little gifts over the holidays.  Everyone was excited to get one and loved the great colors.</li>
            <li> Very pretty! Haven&#x27;t used them yet. Mostly want them for gift pack for my hostess, at my Jamberry Nail Parties.  https://debbieweber.jamberrynails.net</li>
            <li> Extraordinarily fragile but cuts and smoothes nails like nothing else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe the price for nine of these!  The quality is wonderful.  They are easy to use and they make the tips of your nails so smooth.  I love that each one has its own protective sleeve, which is great for keeping in your purse.  I have natural nails and I have used many files that were rough and left my nails dangerously sharp or damaged and ragged. The grit is very fine, but if you need to file your nails down significantly this totally does the job.  So far I have one in my purse, one at the office, one in the car, one in my nightstand and one in my home office.  You seriously cannot have too many of these.  They would also be a great gift for girlfriends, your daughter or your mom, etc.</li>
            <li> I love these files.  This particular package is a really great value.  I give them to all the ladies and girls in the family in their Christmas stockings.  And I have one here and there and everywhere.</li>
            <li> This were great as bridal shower gifts - love the color options &amp; I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever be able to go back to traditional nail files.</li>
            <li> This is a great fingernail file.  I purchased one on vacation and I loved it and I haven&#x27;t purchased an emory board since.  It keeps my nails from splitting.  I love them.  I have one in every room and in my pocketbook.</li>
            <li> All of the nail files have their own individual plastic covering which helps keep the file clean from being stowed in a purse or pen holder. The quality of the nail file is very nice and I have used one multiple times already and the file is still going strong. It hasn&#x27;t gone smooth like other glass nail files I have used. I have stowed one nail file in my purse, pen bag, pen holder at home and at work. I have also given one to my sister and I still have extras to replace if any misfortunes happen like one breaks in my bag or one wears down. I will buy again, but I don&#x27;t think it will be for a while ;)</li>
            <li> I love the glass files. My only wish was that they were a little thinner, but otherwise a great product!</li>
            <li> These files are nice.  I have dropped and broken so many that I needed a bundle to replace them at home, at work &amp; in car too.</li>
            <li> I love them for filing but I&#x27;ve broken like three of these -- I wish they were more durable, or came in a more durable container. The sleeves they come in aren&#x27;t really protective at all. They are definitely useful (my nails have peeled / chipped a lot less) but they are definitely not something you can throw in your purse for on the go filing.</li>
            <li> I had tried one of these files when I went to a festival and stopped at one of the booths.  As always, the price was higher than I was willing to pay, so I looked on-line.  I found these on Amazon&#x27;s site and did order them. Because they were being shipped directly from China, they took forever to arrive and also the shipping was outrageously expensive.  However, they are really nice nail files and since I hate using nail files because of the way they weaken my nails, I found these ones do well without causing more problems than when I began, which was often the case with the other ones. I am planning on gifting many of my friends for Christmas with the extras that I have, hopefully they will enjoy them as much as I have!</li>
            <li> Love these.  Use them as stocking stuffers.  They last forever.</li>
            <li> I must say that when I got the product that I was completely satisfied with how they looked. There was a nice selection of cute colors and they arrived in perfect condition. I like the texture and their sharpness at the tip for helping clean under the nails as well as having the fine grain to gently file the nails. I thought that the price was really good for nine files. The shipping took a while but that was fine considering that these files are a really nice product.</li>
            <li> I love crystal files and they always go through the scanner at the airport with no problem.  Just don&#x27;t drop them on a tile floor, they will break.</li>
            <li> The price on this was incredible. I keep one everywhere. My husband took off with the lime green one, his favorite color. The file surface takes a little getting used to but works well. I would expect it to last too since it is glass.</li>
            <li> Best Nail files!  These are GREAT!</li>
            <li> This is part of my &amp;#34;favorite things&amp;#34; gift to co-workers. The glass nail files do not shread your nails and over time help eliminate split and cracked nails. These also last for years and can be washed.</li>
            <li> A pack of 9 was perfect! Everyone seems to want one and what a practical gift! Color coordinate for fingers and toes!</li>
            <li> The nail files are really nice. I received them on time. Very happy with this purchase. Will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Great nail file &amp; great results! My co-workers all enjoyed them.  They are great stocking stuffers, and fit easily in my Christmas card.</li>
            <li> I love my ancient glass nail file, and now I can keep spare files wherever I may need one:  car, work, and several around the house.</li>
            <li> I have bought these before and give them to family members who come back to me for more!  They love them!</li>
            <li> These are nice glass nail files. Like the sheath they came in individually. Good for little gifts. will give some out for Christmas, birthdays, or just for fun!</li>
            <li> I love glass files for my thin nails, it doesn&#x27;t destroy them! I have been buying them for a little over a year now and picked my last file up at a drug store. BAD CHOICE. It was terrible quality and dulled in less than 2 weeks. I decided to just buy these because of the amazing reviews. The reviews were right, these files are top notch, haven&#x27;t had a problem with them breaking, and they came packaged perfectly.</li>
            <li> These are great little presents to give and to have on hand! I gave these to as a little present for Mother&#x27;s Day and then those I gave them to wanted to know where to get more. And my dad even wanted one. These work so well, and they last forever! I have a glass nail file that I&#x27;ve used for over 10 years and it still works like its brand new! If you haven&#x27;t used a glass nail file before you definitely should try these!</li>
            <li> This was a great buy!</li>
            <li> I would buy these again. There were enough in the pack to give some away to my family and I kept 3, 1 for work, 1 for my purse, and 1 for home. They are a bit thick so you can&#x27;t really clean under the nail on the sides but works great for filing. You can file either direction and it doesn&#x27;t matter. My mom has acrylics and it works for her too! I have hed these for a few months now and still no complaints.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve lasted me nearly 10 months; I&#x27;m getting ready to re-order. Very high quality, &amp;  even though tjeu take a long time to get here, they&#x27;re well worth the wait. Makes very impressive gift.</li>
            <li> Product is as advertised, does nails efficiently, attractive, having several is a plus, meaning I keep one in my  purse, by the tv, in my desk, etc.</li>
            <li> Even &#x27;professional&#x27; nail files from a Beauty Supply can&#x27;t compare with these. Paper/plastic types wear out and become flimsy after only a few rounds of filing nails. These appear to be tempered glass, chemically etched to a medium-fine, very uniform abrasive grit. Each file has its own protective plastic case, and the size is convenient. I&#x27;ve tossed out all my throwaways. They work just fine for guys, too.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found the cheeky nail files.  I have all my friends and family hooked on these things!! These are better than any store bought glass file, and trust me I have tried a lot of them!  Plus the price on these, unbeatable!  I am sure I will be purchasing these again soon bc I have given away most of mine that I recently bought for Christmas presents!</li>
