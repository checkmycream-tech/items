            <li>Love this stuff!!!</li>
            <li>Great Stuff.</li>
            <li>works great at taming my lion mane.</li>
            <li>Great to use when blow drying hair or wearing in a protective style.</li>
            <li>I love it and just bought 6 bottles!.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>and this product does not make my hair more oily at all!  </li>
            <li>Found another product with Argan Oil that works much better!</li>
            <li>It would be a good product if it didn&#x27;t create so much static in my hair.</li>
            <li>I am very happy that I can purchase it here at Amazon at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>but this one just didn&#x27;t do anything spectacular to my hair.</li>
            <li>I can put the Argan Creme on after washing and it will make my hair very easy to comb out.  </li>
            <li>huge fan and def recommend!</li>
            <li>Leaves hair smooth with a nice shine and protects hair from the damaging heat of blow drying.</li>
            <li>and I love it,</li>
            <li>I love this product it helps my wavy hair to look and feel silky and calms the frizz.</li>
            <li>, Renpure is top on my list for my hair</li>
            <li>I do love the fact that this has no sodium chloride, sulfates, dyes,etc.</li>
            <li>I have bought many hair care products form Renpure Originals</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product is awesome to blow dry hair</li>
            <li>a great bonus, after curling my hair, this creme seems to help my curling iron curls look looser and more natural while still helping them retain their shape.</li>
            <li>the smell isn&#x27;t strong at all.</li>
            <li>This is one fantastic product that does everything necessary to keep your hair looking great.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my hair shiny and free of tangles.</li>
            <li>This blow out cream does the job of Moroccan oil but is much more reasonable.  </li>
            <li>it looking straight and healthy after each use without making it feel too oily.</li>
            <li>I live it, love it, need it.</li>
            <li>My hair stylist couldn&#x27;t believe his eyes during my most recent visit to his salon.</li>
            <li>I used to use Tresemme Heat Tamer Spray, but I&#x27;ve found it just doesn&#x27;t cut it for thicker, coarse hair--this creme formulation is much better for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found it for about 6 or 7 dollars at the pharmacy when I was hunting around for a good, but mildly inexpensive thermal protectant for my particularly thick hair.</li>
            <li>He advised me to simply throw my new found Hair Creme in the Dumpster if I still have any iota of love for my hair.</li>
            <li>I always went back to Curls Rock because it keeps my hair manageable and smooth.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>If you want a lightweight moisturizer for your hair that does not make it greasy, definitely try Renpure&#x27;s Argan Oil Smooth Blow Out Creme.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several argan oil products over the years but this one is really fantastic.</li>
            <li>I was trying to find a new product because of the price and all the chemicals in Curls Rock...</li>
            <li>I replied by telling them it was my new Argan Oil Hair Creme</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t contain all the chemicals that Curls Rock has but it makes my hair feel exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>leaves my hair soft and takes away a lot of frizz</li>
            <li>My hair wasn&#x27;t soft or silky.</li>
            <li>I only used this for the first time last night, but my hair (especially the ends that have been damaged from ombre bleaching and curling my hair all the time) is so soft and the cuticle feels so much healthier.</li>
            <li>but it was nothing major.</li>
            <li>This is less than half the price with more in each bottle.</li>
            <li>This Creme dyed my dark hair &amp;#34;brown&amp;#34; immediately after a couple of days so much so that people started asking me when I began bleaching hair.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> A must have before blow drying. Product is just as described. Leaves hair smooth with a nice shine and protects hair from the damaging heat of blow drying.</li>
            <li> Great Stuff. I live it, love it, need it.</li>
            <li> This blow out cream does the job of Moroccan oil but is much more reasonable.  Keeps my hair shiny and free of tangles.</li>

            <li> Buy this piece of trash at your own risk!!! This Creme dyed my dark hair &amp;#34;brown&amp;#34; immediately after a couple of days so much so that people started asking me when I began bleaching hair. I replied by telling them it was my new Argan Oil Hair Creme but they wouldn&#x27;t believe, they felt I was hiding something. As if dyeing my hair wasn&#x27;t enough, this hair creme also ate up part of my hair in an unforgiving fashion. My hair stylist couldn&#x27;t believe his eyes during my most recent visit to his salon. He advised me to simply throw my new found Hair Creme in the Dumpster if I still have any iota of love for my hair.</li>
            <li> It would be a good product if it didn&#x27;t create so much static in my hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> Not greasy. Great to use when blow drying hair or wearing in a protective style.</li>
            <li> I Already use the shampoo and conditioner and a friend told me about this blow out cream, used it and I love it, leaves my hair soft and takes away a lot of frizz</li>
            <li> I love this product it helps my wavy hair to look and feel silky and calms the frizz.</li>
            <li> My hair is is very thick and this blow out creme leaves it looking straight and healthy after each use without making it feel too oily. I initially bought it on a whim at the drug store a couple years ago but I can&#x27;t find it anywhere around me anymore. I am very happy that I can purchase it here at Amazon at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!! Makes my hair silky and still lightweight!</li>
            <li> I can put the Argan Creme on after washing and it will make my hair very easy to comb out.  I have extremely curly hair and have to use product.  Some I have tried don&#x27;t work at all, some leave my hair feeling heavy, Renpure is top on my list for my hair</li>
            <li> If you want a lightweight moisturizer for your hair that does not make it greasy, definitely try Renpure&#x27;s Argan Oil Smooth Blow Out Creme.  I have very oily hair and this product does not make my hair more oily at all!  It also makes my hair feel way softer.  In addition, it takes out tangles, keeps your hair from not frizzing, and products your hair from using the hairdryer and straightener.  This is one fantastic product that does everything necessary to keep your hair looking great.  One bottle lasts a long time too!</li>
            <li> This product did not deliver as promised. Leaves hair dull. Found another product with Argan Oil that works much better! I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I only used this for the first time last night, but my hair (especially the ends that have been damaged from ombre bleaching and curling my hair all the time) is so soft and the cuticle feels so much healthier.

            <li> I love this product is awesome to blow dry hair</li>
            <li> I do think it protects my hair from the heat of my blow dryer and the smell isn&#x27;t strong at all. I do feel like it weighs my hair down a little and it can be a little greasy. I noticed a slight difference in my hair after blow drying but it was nothing major. My hair wasn&#x27;t soft or silky. It felt and looked the same as before. I do love the fact that this has no sodium chloride, sulfates, dyes,etc. That&#x27;s the only reason i continue to buy products form Renpure. I have bought many hair care products form Renpure Originals but this one just didn&#x27;t do anything spectacular to my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product. have used it before and I always come back to it.</li>
