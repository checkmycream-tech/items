            <li>I never thought i&#x27;d find it again; i&#x27;ve been using a olive oil soap from italy for years what a pleasant surprise to find this again.  </li>

            <li>This olive oil soap has a nice pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li>my wife likes it a lot more than I do, the smell is not quite to my taste, but the results are superb, it lathers nicely and is great for your hair and all over, it leaves your skin very nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>Excellent value for very gentle soap.</li>
            <li>I love this soap!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this soap!</li>
            <li>but it did arrive safe in 7-8 days!</li>
            <li>If anybody has been successful in making this work as shampoo, I&#x27;d love to hear that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>

            <li>Love this cleansing bar!</li>
            <li>Just amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great value and for some reason, I&#x27;m very happy to be able to buy directly from the manufacturer in Greece.  </li>
            <li>Get Your Own, Pal.</li>
            <li>Nice foaming and lathering.&lt;br /&gt;Not a fragrant soap yet not odorless.</li>
            <li>perfect for an all natural soap without toxins and chemicals!</li>
            <li>It feels very freshening and has a very good Olive scent.</li>
            <li>I love all natural soaps and this soap was wonderful.</li>
            <li>DOESN&#x27;T LEAVE SKIN AS SOFT AS THOUGHT AND DOESN&#x27;T SMELL VERY PLEASANT.</li>
            <li>It lathers well, and there is a very smooth glide when using the soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so my health, teeth and skin are very important to me.</li>
            <li>I love the texture and the mild fragrance of this soap, and it&#x27;s good to my skin.</li>
            <li>Love the minimalistic composition.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I love the smell of olive oil.</li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>was looking for a cheaper, yet still healthy alternative, and I can&#x27;t say it doesn&#x27;t deliver from that stand-point.</li>
            <li>I love the versatility of this soap.  </li>
            <li>When we finish this package of 6 bars, I&#x27;m sure we will reorder.</li>
            <li>I love this brand-  </li>
            <li>I love the idea of this soap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several brands but this is the best!</li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t that great out of the wrapper, but after you soap up and use it, you don&#x27;t really smell it - you just FEEL the difference.  </li>
            <li>My makeup even goes on better</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this soap and have it used it for two years now.</li>
            <li>and it stays moisturized most of the day without adding lotion.  </li>
            <li>When I ordered these, they came from a seller in Greece, so it wasn&#x27;t surprising that they looked, felt, and smelled a lot more fresh than the Papoutsanis soaps I purchased here in the USA.</li>
            <li>This Greek Olive Oil Soap is just a wonderful item!</li>
            <li>Love it, love it, love it.</li>
            <li>I love all what was reviewed and the ingredients but my skin has not reacted as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Beware of prolonged moisture on this soap, like most soaps, it will soften up and the slime will stay on the surfaces it sits</li>
            <li>I love it more than Dove.</li>
            <li>Glad could buy it in bulk.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, for more bang for your buck, I suggest unwrapping each bar and stacking them in a closet to air out, as I&#x27;ve done.</li>
            <li>take more than a week till now.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t complain when it&#x27;s free!</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin, and also for hair washing.</li>
            <li>I have type 4 combination natural hair and this soap is a welcome addition to my regimen.</li>
            <li>very nice for those of us with sensitive skin.....</li>
            <li>Very nice soaps for the price, a real steal considering you&#x27;d be lucky to get 2 comparable soaps for this price + shipping.</li>
            <li>rinses easily ,dosen&#x27;t leave a film on your skin.</li>
            <li>I love how clean it makes me feel.</li>
            <li>Not too strong.</li>
            <li>VERY good for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery!</li>
            <li>A good bar of soap and a little bit of natural moisturizer are the best for my skin.</li>
            <li>The soap lathers well and leaves my skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think there is a way that you couldn&#x27;t enjoy using them.</li>
            <li>My sister found the charge nurse and said, what is the 3rd most famous hospital in the world doing using scented cleaners (because when they cleaned the floor of course they were using some kind of noxious pine-sol type stuff.</li>
            <li>This soap is fragrance free and therefore does not irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>Smell fine, get you clean without overly drying your skin.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth while!</li>
            <li>I have had several brands of olive oil soap, and this is the best so far.</li>
            <li>Great for dry skin!  </li>
            <li>bright red</li>
            <li>My husband tried it and wants me to order more.</li>
            <li>Nice all natural soap without lots of chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I have used olive soap for years and it makes your skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Just for kicks I bought a bar of this soap, figuring that the Dr. Bonner stuff full of vegetable glycerine (which is CORN by the way) and every &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; shampoo either made my scalp scaly with eczema or</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>Finally, a good quality, basic soap that doesn&#x27;t stink or irritate at all.</li>
            <li>I had gone to many sites before I found the right ones: from Greece and smooth and reasonable.  </li>
            <li>A nice gentle lather, very mild olive-y scent, and leaves the skin soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed the earthy smells of other olive oil soaps, but these bars smell acrid, chemically maybe, kind of off putting in shower.</li>
            <li>It is very natural and genuine!</li>
            <li>This soap has a light, somewhat green/earthy scent that seems very gender-neutral in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying this soap so far, but am disturbed by the smell.</li>
            <li>I used Dove for sensitive skin until I discovered olive oil soap a year ago and love it.</li>
            <li>The soap does have a good natural smell, but it seems to completely wash off -</li>
            <li>took a while for it to arrive in that it was shipped from Greece, but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>I can feel soft touch of it when I am in the bath :)</li>
            <li>A nice quality basic soap.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this soap -- while soaps are a very individual fit, after using this for years, I&#x27;d have to say from experience that it&#x27;s definitely worth a try. :)</li>
            <li>but for me it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>It removes all my make-up very easily 4. does not dry out my skin 5.</li>
            <li>pure, clean, and all-natural.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty soft, so it gets soap on the soap dish, which is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>The price was right too.</li>
            <li>Been using this soap since my honeymoon in Greece in the &#x27;60&#x27;s - very gentle.</li>
            <li>I wanted soap that was Not artificially scented and gentle.</li>
            <li>We fell in love with on a  recent visit to Greece.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>This is the first soap I can use on him that doesn&#x27;t make him break out.</li>
            <li>First time I bought it, it shipped from Greece and took 6 weeks to show up.  </li>
            <li>I ordered three bars and by the time I had used the first bar I knew that I wanted more, so the next time I ordered the case of six bars.</li>
            <li>I was a patient in a famous Washington DC hospital and they were giving a sponge bath to the lady next to me.</li>
            <li>Relaxing scent is very soothing and freshly aromatic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lasts pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves skin clean and soft!</li>
            <li>Buy it and experience the rich suds, the soft results.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face and neck once a day, and it leaves my skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li>While I sometimes miss the fragrance of big brand soap, I doubt I ever go back as this has been really good for my skin</li>
            <li>This is easily solved by putting the soap on a dish where it can properly drain.</li>
            <li>While that&#x27;s a good thing considering the beating they took during shipping (they bend versus break), it means they&#x27;re not as long lasting as they could be.</li>
            <li>But it still can be drying for certain skin types.</li>
            <li>This is pure heaven.</li>
            <li>It is definitely Pure Olive.</li>
            <li>This stuff is pure  2.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin squeaky clean -- literally &#x27;squeaky&#x27; clean compared to other soaps out there that leave a residue, which this one doesn&#x27;t seem to.</li>
            <li>Papoutsanis olive oil soap will leave you feeling squeaky clean and fresh, leaving no residue, and doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to trying this soap.  </li>
            <li>This is the real thing.  </li>
            <li>And at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I do use it at the sinks for hand washing because it cleans well, lasts practically forever and is much more affordable than liquid hand soap without all the plastic.</li>
            <li>Men will really like this soap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very masculine(if</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to use as much because it just goes on smoother.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really hooked now.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face clean, soft, and not dried out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it appropriate for average skin or skin</li>
            <li>This soap is ok, but it kind of stinks in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Luckily, it doesn&#x27;t cause any extra buildup on the bathtub or shower door.  </li>
            <li>It has a particular smell</li>
            <li>I am an older woman</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Another review mentioned putting the soap on top of a brush so it can drain; I keep mine dry and un-slimy in a soap travel dish, but store it propped sideways in the soap container so that only the edge of the very end touches the container.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very creamy and natural smelling.</li>
            <li>I started using this soap, and it rinses off, so you&#x27;re squeaky clean, but after you dry off, you skin feels like silk.  </li>
            <li>The smell is strange, but not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>also love the Nubian Heritage Raw Shea Butter Bar Soap.</li>
            <li>my wife is very sensitive to smell</li>
            <li>old mom use it!</li>
            <li>seems gentle, no awful small (very subtle smell, which is nice).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had eczema near all my life which means that I&#x27;m very sensitive to soaps, detergents, shampoos etc., and with soaps I have to go unscented.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a little dry or a little oily -- though on extremely dry or extremely oily skin, I haven&#x27;t found it as ideal and sometimes I need something more.</li>
            <li>By the time you&#x27;re done with your first bar, your remaining soaps should be harder, milder, and longer lasting due to losing excess water weight. :)</li>
            <li>The olive oil soap gives a natural feel.</li>
            <li>It is non-irritating and gentle enough for every day use, even in winter.  </li>
            <li>My face and body are so soft.  </li>
            <li>Shipping is always early.</li>
            <li>My children all have eczema and sensitive skin</li>
            <li>WOW I ORDERED THESE</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>My hair was soft, shiny, the eczema cleared up.</li>
            <li>I visited my daughter and notice her skin felt so soft.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft, I also use it to wash my hair in between co-washes and it does not strip it.</li>
            <li>My wife tends to get dry skin, especially on her elbows, and within 2 weeks, there was a tremendous difference.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally, I like the small batch olive oil soaps made by CST in Fall River MA that find their way in small numbers at great prices at TJ Max in the skin department, I find the very faint perfumes they use to be very nice.</li>
            <li>This soap is gentle on sensitive and dry skin types.</li>
            <li>personally keep it on top of a brush, to have any water drip down and stay as dry as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This soap leaves your skin soft and not dry.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have to say that this soap does feel a tad bit more processed than Marseilles soap (a French olive oil-based soap), but it still feels a lot less processed than any other soaps out there I&#x27;ve tried -- and you pay for that in price because Marseilles soap costs a lot</li>
            <li>After spending a good amount of $$ on brand name and chemical laden cosmetics, I realized that I was supporting an industry that makes money off women&#x27;s insecurity, and creates products that&#x27;s bad for looks and health over a long term.</li>
            <li>I think this soap does the job, not only is it natural with 4 ingredients but it made my skin feel supple and moisturized.</li>
            <li>The lather can be harder to build up with hands alone than other soap varieties, but that&#x27;s easily solved with a sponge or bath mitt and a small price to pay for a gentle, natural soap.</li>
            <li>This soap leaves very faint scent of pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really have no complaints, other than I wish it did have some sort of fragrance to it.</li>
            <li>It does not dry my skin out.</li>
            <li>and I am a major frizz head (caucasian variety with some African mixed in).</li>
            <li>those of you not familiar with Papoutsanis olive oil soap, it&#x27;s gentle, and unlike some liquid castile soaps I&#x27;ve used, this doesn&#x27;t over-moisturize my skin, or cause it to become oily.</li>

            <li> I was so happy to find these Olive Oil Soaps from greece.  </li>
            <li> I feel like it&#x27;s a great quality for the price, which means I can use it every day and not suffer for that in terms of my skin or my wallet.</li>
            <li> AND I AM NOT AS HAPPY ABOUT THIS SOAP</li>
            <li> great product.</li>

            <li> Nice!</li>
            <li> I never thought i&#x27;d find it again; i&#x27;ve been using a olive oil soap from italy for years what a pleasant surprise to find this again.  </li>
            <li> This is easily the best soap I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>

            <li> This is good soap.</li>
            <li> This olive oil soap has a nice pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> my wife likes it a lot more than I do, the smell is not quite to my taste, but the results are superb, it lathers nicely and is great for your hair and all over, it leaves your skin very nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> Excellent value for very gentle soap.</li>
            <li> I love this soap!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this soap!</li>
            <li> but it did arrive safe in 7-8 days!</li>
            <li> If anybody has been successful in making this work as shampoo, I&#x27;d love to hear that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite olive oil soap!</li>
            <li> Love this cleansing bar!</li>
            <li> Just amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great value and for some reason, I&#x27;m very happy to be able to buy directly from the manufacturer in Greece.  </li>
            <li> Get Your Own, Pal.</li>
            <li> Nice foaming and lathering.&lt;br /&gt;Not a fragrant soap yet not odorless.</li>
            <li> perfect for an all natural soap without toxins and chemicals!</li>
            <li> It feels very freshening and has a very good Olive scent.</li>
            <li> I love all natural soaps and this soap was wonderful.</li>
            <li> DOESN&#x27;T LEAVE SKIN AS SOFT AS THOUGHT AND DOESN&#x27;T SMELL VERY PLEASANT.</li>
            <li> It lathers well, and there is a very smooth glide when using the soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so my health, teeth and skin are very important to me.</li>
            <li> I love the texture and the mild fragrance of this soap, and it&#x27;s good to my skin.</li>
            <li> Love the minimalistic composition.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> I love the smell of olive oil.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.</li>
            <li> was looking for a cheaper, yet still healthy alternative, and I can&#x27;t say it doesn&#x27;t deliver from that stand-point.</li>
            <li> I love the versatility of this soap.  </li>
            <li> When we finish this package of 6 bars, I&#x27;m sure we will reorder.</li>
            <li> I love this brand-  </li>
            <li> I love the idea of this soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several brands but this is the best!</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t that great out of the wrapper, but after you soap up and use it, you don&#x27;t really smell it - you just FEEL the difference.  </li>
            <li> My makeup even goes on better</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this soap and have it used it for two years now.</li>
            <li> and it stays moisturized most of the day without adding lotion.  </li>
            <li> When I ordered these, they came from a seller in Greece, so it wasn&#x27;t surprising that they looked, felt, and smelled a lot more fresh than the Papoutsanis soaps I purchased here in the USA.</li>
            <li> This Greek Olive Oil Soap is just a wonderful item!</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it.</li>
            <li> I love all what was reviewed and the ingredients but my skin has not reacted as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Beware of prolonged moisture on this soap, like most soaps, it will soften up and the slime will stay on the surfaces it sits</li>
            <li> I love it more than Dove.</li>
            <li> Glad could buy it in bulk.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, for more bang for your buck, I suggest unwrapping each bar and stacking them in a closet to air out, as I&#x27;ve done.</li>
            <li> take more than a week till now.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t complain when it&#x27;s free!</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin, and also for hair washing.</li>
            <li> I have type 4 combination natural hair and this soap is a welcome addition to my regimen.</li>
            <li> very nice for those of us with sensitive skin.....</li>
            <li> Very nice soaps for the price, a real steal considering you&#x27;d be lucky to get 2 comparable soaps for this price + shipping.</li>
            <li> rinses easily ,dosen&#x27;t leave a film on your skin.</li>
            <li> I love how clean it makes me feel.</li>
            <li> Not too strong.</li>
            <li> VERY good for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery!</li>
            <li> A good bar of soap and a little bit of natural moisturizer are the best for my skin.</li>
            <li> The soap lathers well and leaves my skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there is a way that you couldn&#x27;t enjoy using them.</li>
            <li> My sister found the charge nurse and said, what is the 3rd most famous hospital in the world doing using scented cleaners (because when they cleaned the floor of course they were using some kind of noxious pine-sol type stuff.</li>
            <li> This soap is fragrance free and therefore does not irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> Smell fine, get you clean without overly drying your skin.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth while!</li>
            <li> I have had several brands of olive oil soap, and this is the best so far.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin!  </li>
            <li> bright red</li>
            <li> My husband tried it and wants me to order more.</li>
            <li> Nice all natural soap without lots of chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I have used olive soap for years and it makes your skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Just for kicks I bought a bar of this soap, figuring that the Dr. Bonner stuff full of vegetable glycerine (which is CORN by the way) and every &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; shampoo either made my scalp scaly with eczema or</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> Finally, a good quality, basic soap that doesn&#x27;t stink or irritate at all.</li>
            <li> I had gone to many sites before I found the right ones: from Greece and smooth and reasonable.  </li>
            <li> A nice gentle lather, very mild olive-y scent, and leaves the skin soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed the earthy smells of other olive oil soaps, but these bars smell acrid, chemically maybe, kind of off putting in shower.</li>
            <li> It is very natural and genuine!</li>
            <li> This soap has a light, somewhat green/earthy scent that seems very gender-neutral in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this soap so far, but am disturbed by the smell.</li>
            <li> I used Dove for sensitive skin until I discovered olive oil soap a year ago and love it.</li>
            <li> The soap does have a good natural smell, but it seems to completely wash off -</li>
            <li> took a while for it to arrive in that it was shipped from Greece, but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I can feel soft touch of it when I am in the bath :)</li>
            <li> A nice quality basic soap.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this soap -- while soaps are a very individual fit, after using this for years, I&#x27;d have to say from experience that it&#x27;s definitely worth a try. :)</li>
            <li> but for me it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> It removes all my make-up very easily 4. does not dry out my skin 5.</li>
            <li> pure, clean, and all-natural.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty soft, so it gets soap on the soap dish, which is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> The price was right too.</li>
            <li> Been using this soap since my honeymoon in Greece in the &#x27;60&#x27;s - very gentle.</li>
            <li> I wanted soap that was Not artificially scented and gentle.</li>
            <li> We fell in love with on a  recent visit to Greece.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> This is the first soap I can use on him that doesn&#x27;t make him break out.</li>
            <li> First time I bought it, it shipped from Greece and took 6 weeks to show up.  </li>
            <li> I ordered three bars and by the time I had used the first bar I knew that I wanted more, so the next time I ordered the case of six bars.</li>
            <li> I was a patient in a famous Washington DC hospital and they were giving a sponge bath to the lady next to me.</li>
            <li> Relaxing scent is very soothing and freshly aromatic.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lasts pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves skin clean and soft!</li>
            <li> Buy it and experience the rich suds, the soft results.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face and neck once a day, and it leaves my skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li> While I sometimes miss the fragrance of big brand soap, I doubt I ever go back as this has been really good for my skin</li>
            <li> This is easily solved by putting the soap on a dish where it can properly drain.</li>
            <li> While that&#x27;s a good thing considering the beating they took during shipping (they bend versus break), it means they&#x27;re not as long lasting as they could be.</li>
            <li> But it still can be drying for certain skin types.</li>
            <li> This is pure heaven.</li>
            <li> It is definitely Pure Olive.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pure  2.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin squeaky clean -- literally &#x27;squeaky&#x27; clean compared to other soaps out there that leave a residue, which this one doesn&#x27;t seem to.</li>
            <li> Papoutsanis olive oil soap will leave you feeling squeaky clean and fresh, leaving no residue, and doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to trying this soap.  </li>
            <li> This is the real thing.  </li>
            <li> And at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I do use it at the sinks for hand washing because it cleans well, lasts practically forever and is much more affordable than liquid hand soap without all the plastic.</li>
            <li> Men will really like this soap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very masculine(if</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to use as much because it just goes on smoother.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really hooked now.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face clean, soft, and not dried out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it appropriate for average skin or skin</li>
            <li> This soap is ok, but it kind of stinks in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Luckily, it doesn&#x27;t cause any extra buildup on the bathtub or shower door.  </li>
            <li> It has a particular smell</li>
            <li> I am an older woman</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Another review mentioned putting the soap on top of a brush so it can drain; I keep mine dry and un-slimy in a soap travel dish, but store it propped sideways in the soap container so that only the edge of the very end touches the container.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very creamy and natural smelling.</li>
            <li> I started using this soap, and it rinses off, so you&#x27;re squeaky clean, but after you dry off, you skin feels like silk.  </li>
            <li> The smell is strange, but not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> also love the Nubian Heritage Raw Shea Butter Bar Soap.</li>
            <li> my wife is very sensitive to smell</li>
            <li> old mom use it!</li>
            <li> seems gentle, no awful small (very subtle smell, which is nice).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had eczema near all my life which means that I&#x27;m very sensitive to soaps, detergents, shampoos etc., and with soaps I have to go unscented.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a little dry or a little oily -- though on extremely dry or extremely oily skin, I haven&#x27;t found it as ideal and sometimes I need something more.</li>
            <li> By the time you&#x27;re done with your first bar, your remaining soaps should be harder, milder, and longer lasting due to losing excess water weight. :)</li>
            <li> The olive oil soap gives a natural feel.</li>
            <li> It is non-irritating and gentle enough for every day use, even in winter.  </li>
            <li> My face and body are so soft.  </li>
            <li> Shipping is always early.</li>
            <li> My children all have eczema and sensitive skin</li>
            <li> WOW I ORDERED THESE</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> My hair was soft, shiny, the eczema cleared up.</li>
            <li> I visited my daughter and notice her skin felt so soft.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft, I also use it to wash my hair in between co-washes and it does not strip it.</li>
            <li> My wife tends to get dry skin, especially on her elbows, and within 2 weeks, there was a tremendous difference.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally, I like the small batch olive oil soaps made by CST in Fall River MA that find their way in small numbers at great prices at TJ Max in the skin department, I find the very faint perfumes they use to be very nice.</li>
            <li> This soap is gentle on sensitive and dry skin types.</li>
            <li> personally keep it on top of a brush, to have any water drip down and stay as dry as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This soap leaves your skin soft and not dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have to say that this soap does feel a tad bit more processed than Marseilles soap (a French olive oil-based soap), but it still feels a lot less processed than any other soaps out there I&#x27;ve tried -- and you pay for that in price because Marseilles soap costs a lot</li>
            <li> After spending a good amount of $$ on brand name and chemical laden cosmetics, I realized that I was supporting an industry that makes money off women&#x27;s insecurity, and creates products that&#x27;s bad for looks and health over a long term.</li>
            <li> I think this soap does the job, not only is it natural with 4 ingredients but it made my skin feel supple and moisturized.</li>
            <li> The lather can be harder to build up with hands alone than other soap varieties, but that&#x27;s easily solved with a sponge or bath mitt and a small price to pay for a gentle, natural soap.</li>
            <li> This soap leaves very faint scent of pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really have no complaints, other than I wish it did have some sort of fragrance to it.</li>
            <li> It does not dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> and I am a major frizz head (caucasian variety with some African mixed in).</li>
            <li> those of you not familiar with Papoutsanis olive oil soap, it&#x27;s gentle, and unlike some liquid castile soaps I&#x27;ve used, this doesn&#x27;t over-moisturize my skin, or cause it to become oily.</li>
            <li> Got too soft after first used, smell not pleasant</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin due to various chemical allergies.  </li>
            <li> scent other then a natural Olive Oil one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If your soap does get slimy, just rub your dry hands on the soft soap and then wet your hands.</li>
            <li> It lathers well, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, and I&#x27;m still on the case I bought last year with three bars left.  </li>
            <li> although the bars do not last long it is grade A quality.</li>
            <li> It has enough oil to soften and not dry like other soaps.  </li>
            <li> It is just a little far for the shipping...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally, I&#x27;m glad that we don&#x27;t use things that are loaded with artificial scents.  </li>
            <li> if left wet - turns slimy.</li>
            <li> , it seems that this bar soap lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> My 1year old son has a chemical detergent sensitivity and a few food allergies including coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Just started using it, so hoping it will help with my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I recommend it for anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> gets rid of dandruff &amp; dry skin after shower</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out or give it that &amp;#34;ashy&amp;#34; appearance after bathing.</li>
            <li> I prefer to use products that are natural that have had little to no refinement in their process and this soap is now a staple as one of them!</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the texture is very soft and malleable compared to other olive oil soaps I&#x27;ve bought in the past.</li>
            <li> It did arrive within the earlier portion of the estimated date, but expect to wait longer than you would typically.</li>
            <li> The only set back was it was at least a weeks wait for delivery</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about Papoutsanis&#x27; production process, but this *could* be a sign that the soap has not been &#x27;cured&#x27;, or aged,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different brand of olive oil soap, I think I&#x27;ll stick to this one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it just doesn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; smell that other olive oil soaps have.</li>
            <li> Other bar soaps tend to over-dry, but this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> As one of the other reviewers had mentioned, I also noticed that the fresher soap was softer and lasted for a shorter amount of time.</li>
            <li> It is solving my dry skin problem during this harsh winter season.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to be thick enough to stay on hair.  </li>
            <li> tried to turn it into liquid shampoo/body wash by mixing half the bar (chopped up) with 2 cups of distilled boiling water.  </li>
            <li> That should tell you how long it lasts for at least one person</li>
            <li> This is one of the few soaps that doesn&#x27;t make me break out</li>
            <li> My DH thought I was nuts, till he saw what it looked like after it dried.</li>
            <li> there are no strong smells or fragrances and lasts forever</li>
            <li> Finding a real soap, not made from detergent and that doesn&#x27;t have coconut oil, has been very difficult.</li>
            <li> Small bars sold six to a case.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice a smell to it at all aside from maybe a small olive scent?  </li>
            <li> I am not sure why these are not a more mainstream item in the US.</li>
            <li> How can you not love olive oil soap.  </li>
            <li> I became allergic to all the usual things: parabens, glycols, sodium laurel sulfate etc.</li>
            <li> hard to want to use it even though it lathers well</li>
            <li> Olive oil soap is among some of the least drying soaps.  </li>
            <li> Desperate, last month I used this as shampoo.</li>
            <li> I am staying where this is very hard water and have stopped taking showers because of the minerals staying on my skin and thought the olive soap would help with this condition but has had very little effect.</li>
            <li> I do not care for perfumy soaps but what I received actually smells bad.</li>
            <li> The smell, on the other hand, is just too unpleasant to justify a repurchase for me.</li>
            <li> Very subtle scent of olive oil.</li>
            <li> However this soap dried out my face and body something terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Love the minimalistic composition. But it still can be drying for certain skin types.</li>
            <li> seems gentle, no awful small (very subtle smell, which is nice). Just started using it, so hoping it will help with my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to trying this soap.  I know it stated that there was no fragrance added, but to me this soap smells in a very unpleasant way. I did like how my skin felt after using, however I don&#x27;t think I will by this brand again.  :(</li>
            <li> This is the real thing.  It has the smell and feel I remembered for Greek olive oil soap.  And at a reasonable price.  Great for sensitive skin, and also for hair washing.</li>
            <li> I wanted soap that was Not artificially scented and gentle. I have eczema and found olive oil soap to be helpful. The price was right too.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this soap so far, but am disturbed by the smell. I do not care for perfumy soaps but what I received actually smells bad. I have enjoyed the earthy smells of other olive oil soaps, but these bars smell acrid, chemically maybe, kind of off putting in shower.</li>
            <li> very nice for those of us with sensitive skin.....try it - you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for years but cannot find it in my city anymore.  This soap leaves your skin soft and not dry.  Excellent product.  I recommend it for anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> This soap is gentle on sensitive and dry skin types. Can be used on the face, as well as the entire body.&lt;br /&gt;No scent other then a natural Olive Oil one.&lt;br /&gt;I like to use it for my hands and face. Will not break out acne prone skin!</li>
            <li> I love this soap! I&#x27;ve had eczema near all my life which means that I&#x27;m very sensitive to soaps, detergents, shampoos etc., and with soaps I have to go unscented. I used Dove for sensitive skin until I discovered olive oil soap a year ago and love it. Papoutsanis olive oil soap will leave you feeling squeaky clean and fresh, leaving no residue, and doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out. The soap does have a good natural smell, but it seems to completely wash off - my wife is very sensitive to smell and she wouldn&#x27;t like it if any smell lingered, so don&#x27;t worry about scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strongly recommend. I&#x27;ll probably keep using olive oil soap for ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A number of reviews mention that the soap - if left wet - turns slimy. This is easily solved by putting the soap on a dish where it can properly drain. Another review mentioned putting the soap on top of a brush so it can drain; I keep mine dry and un-slimy in a soap travel dish, but store it propped sideways in the soap container so that only the edge of the very end touches the container. Problem solved!  If your soap does get slimy, just rub your dry hands on the soft soap and then wet your hands. After a couple of hand washes, you&#x27;ll have de-slimed your soap!</li>
            <li> rinses easily ,dosen&#x27;t leave a film on your skin.VERY good for dry skin. love it</li>
            <li> I love the texture and the mild fragrance of this soap, and it&#x27;s good to my skin.</li>
            <li> Great soap. I love the smell of olive oil. Not too strong.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. I reordered it a second time.</li>
            <li> I am very happy I ordered this soap. It is solving my dry skin problem during this harsh winter season. My husband tried it and wants me to order more. It takes a while to get it because it comes from Greece but it&#x27;s worth while!</li>
            <li> An excellent product.  We fell in love with on a  recent visit to Greece.&lt;br /&gt;It took a while for it to arrive in that it was shipped from Greece, but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> perfect for an all natural soap without toxins and chemicals!</li>
            <li> dont know what else to say. this is the only soap i use. there are no strong smells or fragrances and lasts forever</li>
            <li> Four ingredients, that&#x27;s it. Olive oil, water, sodium chloride, and citric acid. It sounds wonderful, and if you&#x27;re someone who lives by the mantra &amp;#34;less is more&amp;#34; for your hygienic products, this will meet that criterion. It lathers well, and there is a very smooth glide when using the soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it just doesn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; smell that other olive oil soaps have. If you&#x27;ve smelled the &amp;#34;Kiss my Face&amp;#34; brand olive oil soap (which smells like tires), this one smells very similar to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a cheaper, yet still healthy alternative, and I can&#x27;t say it doesn&#x27;t deliver from that stand-point. The smell, on the other hand, is just too unpleasant to justify a repurchase for me.</li>
            <li> Awesome soap. The olive oil soap gives a natural feel.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this soap! It is very natural and genuine! I can feel soft touch of it when I am in the bath :) I Highly recommend it! It is just a little far for the shipping... but it did arrive safe in 7-8 days!</li>
            <li> We are in an effort to reduce/remove use of chemicals in and around our house.  It&#x27;s a great feeling when I know what we put on our skin is not loaded with chemicals.  I love the versatility of this soap.  We not only wash hands with it, but also have substituted it for shampoo and body wash.  It does the work without drying out our skin or hair.  One of the concerns that I have before purchasing was that it won&#x27;t lather well.  And it turns out not to be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I&#x27;m glad that we don&#x27;t use things that are loaded with artificial scents.  This soap leaves very faint scent of pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to turn it into liquid shampoo/body wash by mixing half the bar (chopped up) with 2 cups of distilled boiling water.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to be thick enough to stay on hair.  So, I will use the liquid form only for hand wash for now.  If anybody has been successful in making this work as shampoo, I&#x27;d love to hear that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last, it seems that this bar soap lasts a long time.  When we finish this package of 6 bars, I&#x27;m sure we will reorder.</li>
            <li> Olive oil soap is among some of the least drying soaps.  I love this brand-  although the bars do not last long it is grade A quality.</li>
            <li> Very good soap .....I love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this soap after reading an article about it&#x27;s use as a shampoo. I have type 4 combination natural hair and this soap is a welcome addition to my regimen. After washing I condition with a shea moisture product and continue on with the L-O-C method. I prefer to use products that are natural that have had little to no refinement in their process and this soap is now a staple as one of them!</li>
            <li> My 1year old son has a chemical detergent sensitivity and a few food allergies including coconut oil. This is the first soap I can use on him that doesn&#x27;t make him break out. Finding a real soap, not made from detergent and that doesn&#x27;t have coconut oil, has been very difficult. This soap is now the only soap our family uses for bathing. It is also moisturizing because of the glycerin and it has helped his skin to heal.</li>
            <li> The KISS ME brand is the same but seems to last a lot longer</li>
            <li> the smell was unpleasant, plastic smell,  did return</li>
            <li> Great product, will be ordering again soon. My Skin has been great ever since using.</li>
            <li> This is the best soap for your skin &amp; hair. Keeps skin feeling good. gets rid of dandruff &amp; dry skin after shower</li>
            <li> pure, clean, and all-natural.  Perfect if you have any sensitivity at all to any soaps</li>
            <li> This is pure heaven. I purchased this in Greece over 30 years ago. I never thought i&#x27;d find it again; i&#x27;ve been using a olive oil soap from italy for years what a pleasant surprise to find this again.  THANK YOU!!</li>
            <li> my wife likes it a lot more than I do, the smell is not quite to my taste, but the results are superb, it lathers nicely and is great for your hair and all over, it leaves your skin very nice and soft.  It&#x27;s a great value and for some reason, I&#x27;m very happy to be able to buy directly from the manufacturer in Greece.  It arrived in about a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I like the small batch olive oil soaps made by CST in Fall River MA that find their way in small numbers at great prices at TJ Max in the skin department, I find the very faint perfumes they use to be very nice.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of this soap. All purpose. Simple ingredients. Small bars sold six to a case. However this soap dried out my face and body something terrible. I do use it at the sinks for hand washing because it cleans well, lasts practically forever and is much more affordable than liquid hand soap without all the plastic.</li>
            <li> It is non-irritating and gentle enough for every day use, even in winter.  Very subtle scent of olive oil.</li>
            <li> This soap does smell like tires or something similar, as one review pointed out. The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me however. The soap lathers well and leaves my skin feeling smooth. I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite olive oil soap! I use it on my face and neck once a day, and it leaves my skin clean and soft. Other bar soaps tend to over-dry, but this one doesn&#x27;t. I recommend this brand to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin due to various chemical allergies.  This is one of the few soaps that doesn&#x27;t make me break out and it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
            <li> Very Good Olive Soap. It feels very freshening and has a very good Olive scent. It is definitely Pure Olive. Nice price and Excellent product. Men will really like this soap. It&#x27;s also very masculine(if I must say) give it a try Men you&#x27;ll like it I guarantee.</li>
            <li> Just an amazing deal!</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and I recently started eliminating all xenoestrogens from my toiletries to help balance hormones. I think this soap does the job, not only is it natural with 4 ingredients but it made my skin feel supple and moisturized.</li>
            <li> On my second batch of this olive oil soap. It&#x27;s very creamy and natural smelling. I&#x27;ve tried several brands but this is the best!</li>
            <li> I love all natural soaps and this soap was wonderful. This olive oil soap has a nice pleasant fragrance. It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out or give it that &amp;#34;ashy&amp;#34; appearance after bathing.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find these Olive Oil Soaps from greece.  I had gone to many sites before I found the right ones: from Greece and smooth and reasonable.  I don&#x27;t think there is a way that you couldn&#x27;t enjoy using them.</li>
            <li> works well stinks like industrial cleaner.  hard to want to use it even though it lathers well</li>
            <li> This is moisturizing and skin softening and was inexpensive.  I will  always use it.  I plan to put a bar in my children&#x27;s Christmas stockings.</li>
            <li> Received it in a timely manner, and it is one of the cheapest priced olive oil soaps out there.  My wife tends to get dry skin, especially on her elbows, and within 2 weeks, there was a tremendous difference.  We will never go back to &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; soap again.  It also lasts as well as any soap we have used before.  Big thumbs up!</li>
            <li> My skin has never been softer in my life!  I started using this soap, and it rinses off, so you&#x27;re squeaky clean, but after you dry off, you skin feels like silk.  My face and body are so soft.  I won&#x27;t be using regular soap anymore after using this.  The scent isn&#x27;t that great out of the wrapper, but after you soap up and use it, you don&#x27;t really smell it - you just FEEL the difference.  My makeup even goes on better and I don&#x27;t have to use as much because it just goes on smoother.  I&#x27;m so happy I started using this soap!</li>
            <li> This soap is ok, but it kind of stinks in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Shipping is always early.</li>
            <li> This is easily the best soap I&#x27;ve ever used. My children all have eczema and sensitive skin and it works well for them. I love how clean it makes me feel. The smell is strange, but not unpleasant. I&#x27;ve replaced my body and face products with this soap.</li>
            <li> The only soap I use now.  I buy it for gifts for my mother, my mother-in-law, my sisters and the occasional house guest who comments on it.</li>
            <li> I have had several brands of olive oil soap, and this is the best so far. It leaves my skin ultra-clean, and is non-irritating. It does not dry my skin out. I will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t leave a residue on your skin and they keep the moisture in your skin.</li>
            <li> I love this soap and have it used it for two years now. I don&#x27;t notice a smell to it at all aside from maybe a small olive scent?  It lathers well, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, and I&#x27;m still on the case I bought last year with three bars left.  That should tell you how long it lasts for at least one person and I shower every morning.  While I sometimes miss the fragrance of big brand soap, I doubt I ever go back as this has been really good for my skin and it stays moisturized most of the day without adding lotion.  First time I bought it, it shipped from Greece and took 6 weeks to show up.  The last time I had it within the two day prime window.  I really have no complaints, other than I wish it did have some sort of fragrance to it.</li>
            <li> Nice all natural soap without lots of chemicals.  It&#x27;s pretty soft, so it gets soap on the soap dish, which is easy to clean.  Luckily, it doesn&#x27;t cause any extra buildup on the bathtub or shower door.  A nice quality basic soap.  What&#x27;s not to love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the Nubian Heritage Raw Shea Butter Bar Soap.</li>
            <li> When I ordered these, they came from a seller in Greece, so it wasn&#x27;t surprising that they looked, felt, and smelled a lot more fresh than the Papoutsanis soaps I purchased here in the USA. As one of the other reviewers had mentioned, I also noticed that the fresher soap was softer and lasted for a shorter amount of time. That reviewer had mentioned to leave the soap out and let it harden -- when I did that, the soap did last for longer. -- I thank them for sharing that great tip with everyone! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you not familiar with Papoutsanis olive oil soap, it&#x27;s gentle, and unlike some liquid castile soaps I&#x27;ve used, this doesn&#x27;t over-moisturize my skin, or cause it to become oily. I&#x27;ve found it appropriate for average skin or skin that&#x27;s a little dry or a little oily -- though on extremely dry or extremely oily skin, I haven&#x27;t found it as ideal and sometimes I need something more. This soap has a light, somewhat green/earthy scent that seems very gender-neutral in my opinion. It leaves my skin squeaky clean -- literally &#x27;squeaky&#x27; clean compared to other soaps out there that leave a residue, which this one doesn&#x27;t seem to. The lather can be harder to build up with hands alone than other soap varieties, but that&#x27;s easily solved with a sponge or bath mitt and a small price to pay for a gentle, natural soap. I&#x27;d have to say that this soap does feel a tad bit more processed than Marseilles soap (a French olive oil-based soap), but it still feels a lot less processed than any other soaps out there I&#x27;ve tried -- and you pay for that in price because Marseilles soap costs a lot more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m personally very happy with this soap. I feel like it&#x27;s a great quality for the price, which means I can use it every day and not suffer for that in terms of my skin or my wallet. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend this soap -- while soaps are a very individual fit, after using this for years, I&#x27;d have to say from experience that it&#x27;s definitely worth a try. :)</li>
            <li> I have used olive soap for years and it makes your skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li> This Greek Olive Oil Soap is just a wonderful item! Leaves skin clean and soft! Me and my 85 yr. old mom use it!</li>
            <li> I ordered three bars and by the time I had used the first bar I knew that I wanted more, so the next time I ordered the case of six bars. It might be a luxury but it is also a necessity. Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> 1. This stuff is pure  2. It&#x27;s inexpensive, particularly relative to comparable store-bought stuff 3. It removes all my make-up very easily 4. does not dry out my skin 5. my husband even uses it to wash his hair 6. simple, eco-friendly packaging</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, as advertised.</li>
            <li> These soaps are wonderful.  Smell fine, get you clean without overly drying your skin.  I am not sure why these are not a more mainstream item in the US.</li>
            <li> How can you not love olive oil soap.  It makes your skin feel like silk.  Love it, love it, love it.</li>
            <li> Excellent and fairly priced.</li>
            <li> WOW I ORDERED THESE AND IT TOOK FOREVER TO GET HERE AND I WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH THE PRODUCT!  DOESN&#x27;T LEAVE SKIN AS SOFT AS THOUGHT AND DOESN&#x27;T SMELL VERY PLEASANT. READ THE REVIEWS AND THEY WERE ALL GOOD SO I PURCHASED AND I AM NOT AS HAPPY ABOUT THIS SOAP AS I WOULD LLIKE TO BE.</li>
            <li> Got too soft after first used, smell not pleasant</li>
            <li> When I bought this, I bought only one bar and it took ages to get here. Now I buy it in the 6 pack that&#x27;s Prime. I became allergic to all the usual things: parabens, glycols, sodium laurel sulfate etc. I was a patient in a famous Washington DC hospital and they were giving a sponge bath to the lady next to me. I went bonkers. The soap was scented with orange. My sister found the charge nurse and said, what is the 3rd most famous hospital in the world doing using scented cleaners (because when they cleaned the floor of course they were using some kind of noxious pine-sol type stuff. I had to be moved to a sealed room within the hour. Just for kicks I bought a bar of this soap, figuring that the Dr. Bonner stuff full of vegetable glycerine (which is CORN by the way) and every &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; shampoo either made my scalp scaly with eczema or bright red like I&#x27;d been poisoned. Desperate, last month I used this as shampoo. WOW. My hair was soft, shiny, the eczema cleared up. I skipped conditioner and I am a major frizz head (caucasian variety with some African mixed in). Just amazing. I&#x27;m really hooked now. My DH thought I was nuts, till he saw what it looked like after it dried. He asked to borrow the bar. NOPE. MY SOAP. Get Your Own, Pal. There&#x27;s a reason Greek women swear by this stuff. It&#x27;s awesome. Buy it and experience the rich suds, the soft results. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. A+++++</li>
            <li> I love all what was reviewed and the ingredients but my skin has not reacted as I had hoped. I am staying where this is very hard water and have stopped taking showers because of the minerals staying on my skin and thought the olive soap would help with this condition but has had very little effect.</li>
            <li> Makes taking a bath a real joy!! Relaxing scent is very soothing and freshly aromatic. I will continue to order!!</li>
            <li> Does it&#x27;s job. Nice foaming and lathering.&lt;br /&gt;Not a fragrant soap yet not odorless. It has a particular smell I actually like.&lt;br /&gt;Lasts pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware of prolonged moisture on this soap, like most soaps, it will soften up and the slime will stay on the surfaces it sits on.&lt;br /&gt;I personally keep it on top of a brush, to have any water drip down and stay as dry as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> This soap is fragrance free and therefore does not irritate my skin.  It has enough oil to soften and not dry like other soaps.  I&#x27;ve been jusing olive oil soap from Tarpon Springs for years, but these  bars are an easier-to-handle size.</li>
            <li> A very nice olive oil soap for the price!</li>
            <li> It is wonderful to wash your face with and I believe it does help keep my skin softer. It arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> Great product! Quick delivery!</li>
            <li> I visited my daughter and notice her skin felt so soft. She has psoriasis and said she started using Olive Oil Soap and she would give me some. Well I returned to NYC and forgot the soap. I looked up Olive Oil Soap and noticed that I could order it through Amazon. I ordered two packages of six. I love it more than Dove. I am an older woman so my health, teeth and skin are very important to me. My skin feels softer and there are no perfumes in the soap. The only set back was it was at least a weeks wait for delivery but for me it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Nice! This shipment was a bit more expensive than using the greek company but Amazon Prime makes up for it as it take months for the soap to come from Greece. Leaves skin soft, I also use it to wash my hair in between co-washes and it does not strip it. Glad could buy it in bulk.</li>
            <li> Excellent value for very gentle soap.</li>
            <li> Very good soap. I love it. Good price.</li>
            <li> The product arrived as described, besides being a bit dinged. Very nice soaps for the price, a real steal considering you&#x27;d be lucky to get 2 comparable soaps for this price + shipping. A nice gentle lather, very mild olive-y scent, and leaves the skin soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the texture is very soft and malleable compared to other olive oil soaps I&#x27;ve bought in the past. While that&#x27;s a good thing considering the beating they took during shipping (they bend versus break), it means they&#x27;re not as long lasting as they could be. I don&#x27;t know about Papoutsanis&#x27; production process, but this *could* be a sign that the soap has not been &#x27;cured&#x27;, or aged, properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for more bang for your buck, I suggest unwrapping each bar and stacking them in a closet to air out, as I&#x27;ve done. By the time you&#x27;re done with your first bar, your remaining soaps should be harder, milder, and longer lasting due to losing excess water weight. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for shipping, it took two weeks from one EU country to another. I&#x27;ve never had an order from within the EU take more than a week till now. It did arrive within the earlier portion of the estimated date, but expect to wait longer than you would typically. Can&#x27;t complain when it&#x27;s free!</li>
            <li> I use this soap for shampoo and shower. It lathers well, rinses well, feels good with no chemical feel or smell in my hair or skin. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face clean, soft, and not dried out. After spending a good amount of $$ on brand name and chemical laden cosmetics, I realized that I was supporting an industry that makes money off women&#x27;s insecurity, and creates products that&#x27;s bad for looks and health over a long term. A good bar of soap and a little bit of natural moisturizer are the best for my skin. I&#x27;ve used a few different brand of olive oil soap, I think I&#x27;ll stick to this one.</li>
            <li> great product. swiftly delivered.</li>
            <li> This is good soap. There is no perfume--YAY--no sweetish stink. It isn&#x27;t drying to the skin. It works well on hair. Finally, a good quality, basic soap that doesn&#x27;t stink or irritate at all.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin!  Love this cleansing bar!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my order. The soap is wonderful!</li>
            <li> Been using this soap since my honeymoon in Greece in the &#x27;60&#x27;s - very gentle.</li>
