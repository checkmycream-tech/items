            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>the package is not that great....</li>
            <li>Great putty, after trying a lot of hair products over the years I really love Forge!</li>
            <li>love the product it is great....</li>
            <li>One of my favorite products to use!</li>
            <li>Amazing hold recommend this</li>
            <li>This molding putty took my already gorgeous hair and turned it into a monumental masterpiece fit for mount Rushmore.</li>
            <li>With other smell good products, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>The product is easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m growing the top out</li>
            <li>Definitely the best putty at this price point.</li>
            <li>Definitely the best of this product line.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already signed so many autographs, my hand is beginning to ache.</li>
            <li>Forge has good hold, is very pliable, doesn&#x27;t leave your hair shiny or crunchy, and costs about $5.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this product as a quick replacement until I could buy more Fiber.</li>
            <li>This stuff is really cool.</li>
            <li>Overall a good product for hair styling.</li>
            <li>This stuff works really well, really solid but flexible hold, feels great in your hair (really, my girlfriend is always touching it and saying how good it feels, wow that was really suggestive), no shine and gives a bit of texture.</li>
            <li>And this product is pretty cool too.</li>
            <li>smells pleasant and not to heavy</li>
            <li>I am by no means an expert on hair products, but I&#x27;ve used enough to know a good product and Old Spice Forge is exactly that.  </li>
            <li>This is more for the spike look, but it definitely is not glue-like.  </li>
            <li>This product helps u for those long hair hairstyles... and for the first hair product old spice has created, its really good</li>
            <li>The product inside the container is nice though, just not worth the $ for the amt.</li>
            <li>My son absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>i wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li>I really like this putty for my hair.</li>
            <li>This is great for spikes and other more difficult hair styles.</li>
            <li>but it was a mess ok</li>
            <li>Most products I have found that work cost like $20 for a little jar.</li>
            <li>Also it has a little more hold than I wanted.</li>
            <li>I worked an hour to clean up the other things in the box</li>
            <li>if is a hard plastic screw top jar.  </li>
            <li>I tried this and the Old Spice Unruly.  </li>
            <li>I was definitely surprised.</li>
            <li>This product also leaves the hair feeling natural while still maintaining hold.</li>
            <li>I feel so classy when I use this</li>
            <li>good for spiking short hair, not good for long hair with weight.</li>
            <li>This product offers the same hold and matte finish of fiber for about 1/3 of the price.</li>
            <li>My only problem is that it smells very strongly of old spice, which would be a smaller issue for a dude.</li>
            <li>works as well as some of the higher priced competitor products for a quarter of the price or less!</li>

            <li> It can be left to dry hard if left in place, or it can soften up a bit on the hair if you continue to style it while freshly applied.</li>
            <li> the plastic is hard and does not flex it cracks in shipping when it gets hot and melts all over the inside of a box.</li>
            <li> but I currently have about 2 inches that I keep messy and pushed to the side a bit.</li>
            <li> I like not paying a pink tax.</li>
            <li> very small container, a bit surprised by that.  </li>
            <li> , I have to be careful not to dress too sharp for fear of being mistaken for an Admiral-Movie Star-Aristocrat.</li>
            <li> I prefer the texture and hold of this to other waxes and glues.</li>
            <li> I cleaned up other things and used them and they refunded me for it</li>
            <li> in pantry prime packs with alot of other stuff gets all over everything and makes a mess...</li>
            <li> I use this every day because I can never get part of my hair to stay down.  </li>
            <li> In shipping the lid sometimes cracks in half and makes a mess esp.</li>
            <li> oh boy you have a mess.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to find a product that holds my curly hair in place without making it look stiff and unnatural like gel.</li>
            <li> Just a little expensive.</li>
            <li> weak, no hold.  </li>
            <li> He has thin hair and this gives it body without a hint of stickiness or crunch.</li>

            <li> Excellent hair product for men. My son absolutely loves it. He has thin hair and this gives it body without a hint of stickiness or crunch.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really cool. So I have a really short fade on the sides and I&#x27;m growing the top out but I currently have about 2 inches that I keep messy and pushed to the side a bit. This stuff works really well, really solid but flexible hold, feels great in your hair (really, my girlfriend is always touching it and saying how good it feels, wow that was really suggestive), no shine and gives a bit of texture. Only downside is it isn&#x27;t 100% water soluble but shampoo gets it out immediately. I&#x27;m hoping this stuff still works well when my hair gets a longer</li>
            <li> I am by no means an expert on hair products, but I&#x27;ve used enough to know a good product and Old Spice Forge is exactly that.  Forge has good hold, is very pliable, doesn&#x27;t leave your hair shiny or crunchy, and costs about $5. You can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  I tried this and the Old Spice Unruly.  This is more for the spike look, but it definitely is not glue-like.  I prefer the texture and hold of this to other waxes and glues.</li>

            <li> Amazing hold recommend this</li>
            <li> I use this every day because I can never get part of my hair to stay down.  I will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> Definitely the best of this product line.</li>
            <li> very small container, a bit surprised by that.  Wont buy again.  The product inside the container is nice though, just not worth the $ for the amt.</li>

            <li> Great stuff - Very good holding power without any shiny or hardness after drying.</li>
            <li> weak, no hold.  get tigi bedhead and compare the texture and you&#x27;ll know what i&#x27;m talking about.</li>
            <li> I really like this putty for my hair. However, it becomes a pain to wash out if you use it too often. Also it has a little more hold than I wanted. This is great for spikes and other more difficult hair styles. Overall a good product for hair styling.</li>
            <li> The product is easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li> good for spiking short hair, not good for long hair with weight.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite products to use!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman with short hair, and I like this product. Works excellently. My only problem is that it smells very strongly of old spice, which would be a smaller issue for a dude. With other smell good products, it&#x27;s perfect. I like not paying a pink tax.</li>
            <li> smells pleasant and not to heavy</li>
            <li> Works great. No shine if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re​ looking for. Just a little expensive.</li>
            <li> works as well as some of the higher priced competitor products for a quarter of the price or less!</li>
            <li> And this product is pretty cool too. This molding putty took my already gorgeous hair and turned it into a monumental masterpiece fit for mount Rushmore. I feel so classy when I use this, I have to be careful not to dress too sharp for fear of being mistaken for an Admiral-Movie Star-Aristocrat.

            <li> love the product it is great.... the package is not that great.... if is a hard plastic screw top jar.  the plastic is hard and does not flex it cracks in shipping when it gets hot and melts all over the inside of a box. oh boy you have a mess.
