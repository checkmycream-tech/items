            <li>They smell good and fizz well.  </li>
            <li>The egg-crate package is a good way to send and store the bath bombs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Egg-crate makes for good storage.  </li>
            <li>Good smells.  </li>
            <li>I loved these bath bombs.</li>
            <li>They are good bath bombs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with these bath bombs!</li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>I love these!  </li>
            <li>These smell so amazing.</li>
            <li>No bubbles at all, but nice smell</li>
            <li>Nice concept, but the fragrances are not all liked.  </li>
            <li>Got these as a Christmas gift for my wife and they have the whole house smelling great!</li>
            <li>she thought she was getting some kind of gourmet eggs</li>
            <li>Each are just right size for one bath and a perfect fit in my crystal candy dish at the end of the bath.</li>
            <li>but I fell in love with their smell and their look</li>
            <li>Extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li>Kids love them.</li>
            <li>Gave them as a gift to some friends and they love it too</li>
            <li>And I happen to love the box they come in.</li>
            <li>Wish they had a variety pack that told you what could possibly be in it, and you could pick the variety pack that best suits you.</li>
            <li>Will put be getting some more...</li>
            <li>These were a bit smaller than some of the other popular options but fizzed great in the bath and each one smelled awesome.</li>
            <li>All scents smell very good, and all of them in the carton were different.</li>
            <li>- I don&#x27;t want to be soaking in candy or glitter that will take me more work to clean up.  </li>
            <li>i really enjoy when i use them, i&#x27;m not a bath person</li>
            <li>Use another vender for the REAL Level products (which are amazing.)</li>
            <li>These bombs are wonderful - subtle but still noticeable, makes skin feel smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>Left my skin feeling nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Slightly vintage and old fashioned, but incredibly yummy!  </li>
            <li>Yet, she says other than her first preference, these are great.  </li>
            <li>They probably have some essential oil in it, feels nice but makes the tub greasy.</li>
            <li>I liked that they were individually wrapped aside from the container.</li>
            <li>Some other manufacturers can&#x27;t quite get a good balance between scent and fizz.  </li>
            <li>My husband loves baths and these were right up his alley.  </li>
            <li>I used one of these bombs right after I received them</li>
            <li>My mom is a pretty avid bath bomb user and she is very brand loyal (not to this one).  </li>
            <li>They were cut in half easily, if you wanted more than 1 use per.</li>
            <li>These are a really fun gift, because they are fairly universal, but still feel very special.</li>
            <li>I tried these after trying the huge LUSH bath bombs -</li>
            <li>At first I got them as a gift for someone</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pleased.  </li>
            <li>All 6 of the bath bombs were individually wrapped in plastic, and did come in the egg carton with Level Naturals label on top.</li>
            <li>The scents are beautiful and linger without being overpowering, the oil is light enough to not feel greasy but definitely softens the skin in a lasting and noticeable way.  </li>
            <li>She says the scents are amazing and they work extremely well.  </li>
            <li>The other 4 are quite nice.</li>
            <li>I loved the scents that this set came in; however, although there were 6 different scents, the scents all seemed similar.  </li>
            <li>I will certainly keep you in mind when I need to restock</li>
            <li>Also, the fragrance of these particular bath bombs were overwhelmingly strong and pungent and I do not plan to use what is left after my first experience.</li>
            <li>Shipped extremely fast.</li>
            <li>Unique fragrances that will soothe you to sleep after your bath, or equally stay with you all night out...</li>
            <li>The water is very smooth and the whole bomb dissolves without leaving little grits at the bottom of the tub.</li>
            <li>Cute egg crate holding the bombs, like half dozen eggs.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve concluded that I most likely received the following scents: Grapefruit Bergamot, Chamomile Negoli, Eucalyptus Lime, Lemon Verbena, Forest, and Tangerine Spearmint.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than Lush!</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>so i fill the tub ankle high then turn on the shower.</li>
            <li>i still get the effect &amp; the aroma from the bomb  highly recommend</li>
            <li>Nice smell, a little smaller in size.</li>
            <li>I LOVE these little balls that pack a fragrant punch!</li>
            <li>They make my skin so soft!  </li>
            <li>but when I heard all the positive feed back from those people I decided to buy some for myself.</li>
            <li>She was happily surprised.</li>
            <li>My skin was soft, but I definately didn&#x27;t get that &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; factor.</li>
            <li>I think they are nice &amp; can be compared to the more expensive hand made bombs (twice this price) that I have purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li>The product left my skin soft yet I could not ignore the pungent smell.</li>
            <li>the lush bombs just seemed way too big.  </li>
            <li>The balls that I received where much larger in size to the Level balls, and were not individually sealed in the normal plastic, labeled with Level and the list of ingredients.</li>
            <li>These were all loosely set in a large plastic bag tied at the top with a piece of yarn instead of the Level egg like carton so that when they arrived some were broken.  </li>

            <li> A bit on the small size.</li>
            <li> The price was reasonable and the bombs moisturized like crazy!</li>
            <li> Sadly, I don&#x27;t have a bathtub (just a standing shower).  </li>
            <li> Very poor quality</li>
            <li> Terrible quality:( not worth buying</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s annoying that they are randomly chosen.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m in love with these bath bombs! At first I got them as a gift for someone but I fell in love with their smell and their look so I had to get some for myself! I recommend these for everyone! You will not regret this purchase!</li>
            <li> These were a bit smaller than some of the other popular options but fizzed great in the bath and each one smelled awesome. A hit on mother&#x27;s day !!</li>
            <li> Love! Great scents, feels amazing!</li>
            <li> Great price, great scents, worked perfectly!</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m pleased.  They smell good and fizz well.  Some other manufacturers can&#x27;t quite get a good balance between scent and fizz.  Level seems to do it well.  The egg-crate package is a good way to send and store the bath bombs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;+ Egg-crate makes for good storage.  Each ball is individually wrapped within.&lt;br /&gt;+ Good smells.  Fizzes well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- A bit on the small size.</li>
            <li> smell great..individually wrapped for freshness.  Each are just right size for one bath and a perfect fit in my crystal candy dish at the end of the bath.</li>
            <li> Extremely satisfied. All scents smell very good, and all of them in the carton were different. Would highly recommend. Shipped extremely fast.</li>
            <li> I loved these bath bombs. The price was reasonable and the bombs moisturized like crazy! I loved the scents that this set came in; however, although there were 6 different scents, the scents all seemed similar.  That is one reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars.  I would definitely re-purchase.</li>
            <li> Kids love them. Great price! I think they dissolve a bit too quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Will order again!</li>
            <li> I received my packaged in a timely manner. However, the products arrived in bags tied with yarn and not in the egg carton that is pictured, and appeared to be rather sub-par than professional. Also, the fragrance of these particular bath bombs were overwhelmingly strong and pungent and I do not plan to use what is left after my first experience. The product left my skin soft yet I could not ignore the pungent smell.</li>
            <li> Terrible quality:( not worth buying</li>
            <li> i really enjoy when i use them, i&#x27;m not a bath person so i fill the tub ankle high then turn on the shower. i still get the effect &amp; the aroma from the bomb  highly recommend</li>
            <li> Description reads that this Mixed 6-pk \\&quot;Includes one of each of the following scents: Grapefruit Bergamot, Mud, Citrus Basil, Lemon Ginger Sage, Chamomile Negoli, Lavender Chamomile.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I did not receive these scents. All 6 of the bath bombs were individually wrapped in plastic, and did come in the egg carton with Level Naturals label on top. But only 1 of the 6 bath bombs actually has the Level Naturals wrapping with the scent (Chamomile Negoli) and the ingredients listed. Makes me question if the unlabeled bath bombs are actually Level Naturals Bath Bombs. Also, it&#x27;s frustrating that this item I bought as a gift doesn&#x27;t have each bath bomb labeled so the recipient knows what the different scents are. I did some comparison against some other websites (looking at the color of the bath bombs that I received) and smelled them....and I&#x27;ve concluded that I most likely received the following scents: Grapefruit Bergamot, Chamomile Negoli, Eucalyptus Lime, Lemon Verbena, Forest, and Tangerine Spearmint. I&#x27;ve attached photos of the product packaging as I received it and of the 6 baths bombs(see Product Images from Customers on the right-hand side of the page).</li>
            <li> Product received was not what was ordered. These were not a genuine Level product.The balls that I received where much larger in size to the Level balls, and were not individually sealed in the normal plastic, labeled with Level and the list of ingredients. Instead, what I received smelled liked soapy vanilla blandness instead of the wonderful aromatherapy of the Level balls. These were all loosely set in a large plastic bag tied at the top with a piece of yarn instead of the Level egg like carton so that when they arrived some were broken.  Use another vender for the REAL Level products (which are amazing.)</li>
            <li> I buy this for my mom.  Sadly, I don&#x27;t have a bathtub (just a standing shower).  My mom is a pretty avid bath bomb user and she is very brand loyal (not to this one).  Yet, she says other than her first preference, these are great.  She says the scents are amazing and they work extremely well.  I&#x27;ll take her word for it!</li>
            <li> The box fell apart. Very poor quality</li>
            <li> Perfect for relaxation and as a gift.  I tried these after trying the huge LUSH bath bombs - the lush bombs just seemed way too big.  And a lot of the bombs had stuff like glitter or candy in them which to me was pretty unappealing - I don&#x27;t want to be soaking in candy or glitter that will take me more work to clean up.  These bombs are wonderful - subtle but still noticeable, makes skin feel smooth and silky.  Smells great!  Gave them as a gift to some friends and they love it too</li>
            <li> I am always looking for bath products for my Mother and the bath bombs looked like something she would like.</li>
            <li> They make my skin so soft!  And I happen to love the box they come in.</li>
            <li> I love these!  They smell wonderful and make for a really nice bath.  The water is very smooth and the whole bomb dissolves without leaving little grits at the bottom of the tub.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved the smells! Cute egg crate holding the bombs, like half dozen eggs. I am very satisfied! I will be getting these babies again and again !</li>
            <li> Bought these as gifts for my daughters.  They loved them!!!</li>
            <li> My husband loves baths and these were right up his alley.  He, and my bathroom, smell great - not a flowery scent.</li>
            <li> These are a really fun gift, because they are fairly universal, but still feel very special. I have given these as a gift on a variety of occasions, from &amp;#34;feel better&amp;#34; to Valentines Day, depending on what it&#x27;s packaged with.</li>
            <li> No bubbles at all, but nice smell</li>
            <li> Nice smell, a little smaller in size. They probably have some essential oil in it, feels nice but makes the tub greasy.</li>
            <li> I used one of these bombs right after I received them &amp; it was great!  I think they are nice &amp; can be compared to the more expensive hand made bombs (twice this price) that I have purchased in the past.  I will certainly keep you in mind when I need to restock</li>
            <li> Left my skin feeling nice and smooth. I liked that they were individually wrapped aside from the container. They were cut in half easily, if you wanted more than 1 use per. They smelled great too.</li>
            <li> I bought (3) pkg and gave them away as gifts but when I heard all the positive feed back from those people I decided to buy some for myself. I was not disappointed...you won&#x27;t be either.</li>
            <li> This product was a gift. But I&#x27;m dissapointed because there isn&#x27;t any identification in every bomb, you dont know the tipe od bomb to like to use.</li>
            <li> Nice concept, but the fragrances are not all liked.  Wish they had a variety pack that told you what could possibly be in it, and you could pick the variety pack that best suits you.</li>
            <li> Great deal for your money. Not as big as other bath bombs but who needs that big?!</li>
            <li> Got these bath bombs as a birthday gift. Work great and user was very happy. The variety in choices was great. I will be ordering these again.</li>
            <li> Some smell great, some smell like chemicals for some reason</li>
            <li> This claims to be a &#x27;mixed&#x27; package but I got six of the same bath bomb.</li>
            <li> The scents are beautiful and linger without being overpowering, the oil is light enough to not feel greasy but definitely softens the skin in a lasting and noticeable way.  Would totally buy again to keep or give as gifts.</li>
            <li> Got these as a Christmas gift for my wife and they have the whole house smelling great! I wrapped them and put them in the fridge she thought she was getting some kind of gourmet eggs lol... She was happily surprised. Will put be getting some more...</li>
            <li> they were small than I expected.</li>
            <li> They are good bath bombs. However, it&#x27;s annoying that they are randomly chosen. 2 of the bombs are scents that I despise. The other 4 are quite nice.</li>
            <li> Bath bombs are expensive, so I tried to go for some that were more affordable. Besides turning the water a little less clear, it didn&#x27;t do what I thought it would. My skin was soft, but I definately didn&#x27;t get that &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; factor.</li>
            <li> These smell so amazing. Slightly vintage and old fashioned, but incredibly yummy!  Unique fragrances that will soothe you to sleep after your bath, or equally stay with you all night out... Buy these for the fragrance.  Your bath will never be the same. I LOVE these little balls that pack a fragrant punch!</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loved them! Much cheaper than Lush!</li>
