            <li>Great lamp - has 4 time options, salon grade, quickly hardens any name brand gel polish.  </li>

            <li>Works good, very powerful and can make it feel like your nail is burning.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how easy it is to do gel nails!</li>

            <li>This light works great, completely adequate for home use.</li>
            <li>I used Sally Hansen 3 step LED gel polish and no matter how many times I put my nails under the lamp it never fully cured.  </li>
            <li>I shopped around and this light is a good light for the price.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I bought this thinking led was better than uv for cancer risks.</li>
            <li>Be sure to check the required nail polish before purchasing.</li>
            <li>recommend :)</li>
            <li>but so far it works great.</li>
            <li>I can fit all five fingers in but prefer to do the 4, then the thumb for more comfort.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>, I think it&#x27;s going to work out just fine.</li>
            <li>I like how compact this light is for storage and travel.</li>
            <li>However the paperwork is filled with cancer warnings.</li>
            <li>You can fit all fingers in it</li>
            <li>I can fit all 5 fingers in at once.</li>
            <li>This light doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li>I had my hands under that light for 3 hours</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I paid a little more money to buy a better lamp!  </li>
            <li>This little light works great</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t spend hundreds of dollars on other LED lamps, this one is both affordable and works great.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Gelish gel polish at home for 2-3 years now, using a UV light with perfect results for the standard 1-2 minute dry times.</li>
            <li>Overall, I love it!</li>
            <li>I wanted an LED light for some time to touch ups as I have really gotten into gel polish.  </li>
            <li>You can fit your whole hand in it.</li>
            <li>First time doing it myself and had no problems</li>
            <li>and although I will for the most part stick with my regular polishes, I like having the option of a gel mani when I know I&#x27;m going to be especially busy!</li>
            <li>At first I was very skeptic, but after having this for over 4months, it still work like a champ!</li>
            <li>Plenty of room for my whole hand!  </li>
            <li>Love the different timers.  </li>
            <li>Put your whole hand in-No need to cure thumbs separately!</li>
            <li>Worked really well for me and the price was the lowest I had seen.</li>
            <li>Much safer than the uv lights.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I change my polish out two or three times a week, but was intrigued with the whole &amp;#34;gel polish&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Very lightweight.  </li>
            <li>Plugged it in and it was ready to go, no need to assemble anything or peel anything.</li>
            <li>It only works with a specific kind of nail polish which she doesn&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li>Even after a full 2 minutes, the polish rubbed off with the next coat.</li>
            <li>I bought this light because gel nails don&#x27;t usually last long on me</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t forget to vigorously wipe down your fresh nails with rubbing alcohol soaked cotton to get off the sticky coating after your nails are cured!</li>
            <li>I was hoping to replace an old unit but none of the Gel Polish brands cured with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Had to return it.</li>
            <li>I feel like a professional</li>
            <li>I like the size of the unit but will say to those with large hands or feet, it might be a bit tight.</li>

            <li> Works awesome!  First time doing it myself and had no problems</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money. This never cured my nails after 2+ hrs, my nails were still sticky.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know who&#x27;s leaving this thing good reviews but this lamp was a total failure for me.  I used Sally Hansen 3 step LED gel polish and no matter how many times I put my nails under the lamp it never fully cured.  About 1/3 of the gel polish came off.  I returned it and bought Melodysusie 24 watt LED lamp and it is wonderful!  Cured my sally hansen LED polish in 30 seconds.  Sometimes 45 seconds.  I&#x27;m so glad I paid a little more money to buy a better lamp!  I can&#x27;t believe how easy it is to do gel nails!</li>
            <li> I bought this light because gel nails don&#x27;t usually last long on me so it&#x27;s a money and time saver to be able to do my own nails. I like how compact this light is for storage and travel.</li>

            <li> I use the gel nail products all the time and this is an excellent curing unit. No problems at all. I recommend this lamp. Much safer than the uv lights.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t spend hundreds of dollars on other LED lamps, this one is both affordable and works great.  It could not be easier to use, just push a button and it turns on, then turns off automatically so no over cooking.</li>
            <li> I shopped around and this light is a good light for the price. You can fit your whole hand in it.</li>
            <li> Love it. Great product!  Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Arrived in my 2 day arrival time period.  Great lamp - has 4 time options, salon grade, quickly hardens any name brand gel polish.  The sellers were fantastic and this item is a must if you enjoy doing your own gel manicure!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a nail polish junkie for decades and currently have over 1000 bottles of regular polish.  I change my polish out two or three times a week, but was intrigued with the whole &amp;#34;gel polish&amp;#34; thing, although of course I wouldn&#x27;t go to a salon to have it done since I&#x27;ve yet to meet the nail tech who could &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; my nails as well as I can.  Ordered this lamp after a lot of research, along with several types of gel polishes (and their base/top coats as needed).  This lamp cures the polish promptly and although I will for the most part stick with my regular polishes, I like having the option of a gel mani when I know I&#x27;m going to be especially busy!</li>
            <li> Why pay over $100 when you can pay less and get the same results as salon quality. At first I was very skeptic, but after having this for over 4months, it still work like a champ! I had an event to attend the very next day, and couldn&#x27;t afford my nails to look like crap, I did an overnight shipment. It came on time and just as I expected. I was very pleased and happy with the service. Overall, I love it!</li>
            <li> This light works great!  Plenty of room for my whole hand!  Very lightweight.  Love the different timers.  Easy to use. Nails look great first try!</li>
            <li> Used it for the first time last night with the gelish mini pack &amp; did 30 seconds for each coat, but I&#x27;m not sure what I did wrong. It took a while for the polish to set so I ended up with some nails not as shiny as they&#x27;re supposed to be &amp; some even smudged(mainly the thumbs).</li>
            <li> I just received this product and after one use, I think it&#x27;s going to work out just fine. If problems with it arise later, I&#x27;ll update my review for all to see. I like the size of the unit but will say to those with large hands or feet, it might be a bit tight.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking led was better than uv for cancer risks. However the paperwork is filled with cancer warnings. I guess I&#x27;ll use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> This lamp is great for my Gelish Nail Polish and the setting are good, 30s, 60s, 90s ... versatile.  Great product for Gelish!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife. It only works with a specific kind of nail polish which she doesn&#x27;t use. We returned it with no problems. Be sure to check the required nail polish before purchasing. It probably works well with the correct nail polish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this light. It works great. You can fit all fingers in it but I find that I still need to cure my thumbs extra time, I don&#x27;t mind though.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend :)</li>
            <li> Works great. Easy to use.  One touch button to start timer.  Great buy for the price!</li>
            <li> Excellent light for the price!  Put your whole hand in-No need to cure thumbs separately! The pre set timers are a nice feature too.</li>
            <li> Great product for the money the wife loved it and is very happy.  Just follow the instructions and it works great</li>
            <li> Does a great job.  This cut my nail time by 45 mins.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this item . It works well and does not give me any trouble. Excellent purchase!</li>
            <li> After 4 manicures all supplies are paid for! This light works great, completely adequate for home use. Don&#x27;t forget to vigorously wipe down your fresh nails with rubbing alcohol soaked cotton to get off the sticky coating after your nails are cured!</li>
            <li> Wife&#x27;s very happy works great</li>
            <li> I have been using Gelish gel polish at home for 2-3 years now, using a UV light with perfect results for the standard 1-2 minute dry times. I then bought this product to speed up drying time, but it didn&#x27;t work at all. After 30 seconds, my coat was still completely wet. Even after a full 2 minutes, the polish rubbed off with the next coat. I have since returned this lamp and would not recommend that others buy it for gel nail curing.</li>
            <li> This lamp does NOT work with OPI gel polish.  I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> I have only had it for about a month but so far it works great. Happy with it.</li>
            <li> Work just as expected.  I can fit all 5 fingers in at once.</li>
            <li> Works good, very powerful and can make it feel like your nail is burning.</li>
            <li> This little light works great, The timers are perfect. I can fit all five fingers in but prefer to do the 4, then the thumb for more comfort. Shipping was on time. Plugged it in and it was ready to go, no need to assemble anything or peel anything. Great LED light. Just don&#x27;t be tempted to touch your nails in between steps.  It does its job if you finish all steps. I used Gellish products for gel nails.</li>
            <li> This light doesn&#x27;t work at all. I had my hands under that light for 3 hours and I gave up my nails were still sticky. Reading other reviews seems as though they are all fake reviews.</li>
