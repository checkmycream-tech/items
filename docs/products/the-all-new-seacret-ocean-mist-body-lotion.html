            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This is amazing product.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use makeup either...never liked the stuff.  </li>
            <li>This lotion smells nice but its not my favorite.</li>
            <li>and it works wonderfully to make my skin soft.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell, it is not overpowering like some others.  </li>
            <li>Though I don&#x27;t like the scent, when it is applied the scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming or</li>
            <li>The fragrance is lovely.  </li>
            <li>I do love the lotion and the fact that its not greasy or stinky.  </li>
            <li>I really love this body lotion.</li>
            <li>The SeaCret body lotion consistency is quite like that of Vaseline Intensive Care lotion, although it does have more staying power than the Vaseline.   </li>
            <li>I use it several times a day with wonderful results.</li>
            <li>just love this lotion-smell</li>
            <li>I love how it smells and also how it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>I just love this lotion.</li>
            <li>Love love love.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, absorbs fast, and smells great.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, we&#x27;ve used the other products from this company and all are great.  </li>
            <li>While visiting a friend in Florida, I tried this product and loved it so much, I asked if I could take it home!  </li>
            <li>She loves it.&lt;br /&gt;So not only a good product, but a good price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very rich and creamy, absorbs easily and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I had purchased this lotion some years ago when I was in Israel, so I was really excited to be able to order it.  </li>
            <li>THE SCENT OCEAN IS VERY MILD &amp;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 50+ woman with great skin who has tried many different types and brands of lotions.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m more of a sweet floral scent type gal.</li>
            <li>Not to mention the fact that it has a nice fresh and clean</li>
            <li>This lotion has very nice ingredients that are wonderful for the skin such as; jojoba oil, sweet almond oil, avocado oil, algae extract, dead sea salt, and more.</li>
            <li>Getting this lotion at a discounted price makes it even more worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I thought, whatever, it&#x27;s free, why not?</li>
            <li>It is very good for dry skin, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy  and smells very nice.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I just wish it was sold in larger sizes, or a better deal if you buy more than one at a time.</li>
            <li>SeaCret proclaims to have many minerals that justify the high prices that they charge and, after having tried the products, I just can&#x27;t see the value.   </li>
            <li>but i will definitely buy more once i&#x27;m out!</li>
            <li>and I only liked the nail buffer.</li>
            <li>well worth the price.</li>
            <li>The cuticle oil is effective and not too greasy but not any different than what you would buy elsewhere.</li>
            <li>The price was right, so I will be ordering it again from Amazon when I run out.</li>
            <li>Nice but takes a while to rub dry.</li>
            <li>Also for such an amazing and luxurious lotion the packaging isn&#x27;t very luxurious or pretty.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Hours later, my hands remained supple and moisturized, and I really enjoyed the scent.</li>
            <li>I first received this lotion as a gift from my daughter.  </li>
            <li>I thought this must be worth the high price of the collection</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s priced a bit high, however, it is well worth it.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, you just have to smell it for yourself, because my scent describing skills are pretty much non-existent, but once you do, you&#x27;ll fall for it like I did.</li>
            <li>certainly do recommend this product.</li>
            <li>For what I paid for this lotion I expected more.</li>
            <li>well, it was very manly and I ended up giving the lotion to my husband.  </li>
            <li>ABSORBS INTO SKIN FAST.</li>
            <li>This lotion absorbed into my skin quickly and left in soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s mild scent and moisturizing effect and have been using it for several years, but haven&#x27;t always ordered it from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I knew I liked this because I have had it before and was having a hard time finding it.</li>
            <li>This scent is extraordinarily soft, like the breeze of one of the purest seas out there, but lingering.</li>
            <li>I would purchase it again as long as the price doesn&#x27;t go up any higher.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, smells as close to the ocean as possible with a slight hint of florals thrown in there.</li>
            <li>It really helps my dry skin.</li>
            <li>It is pretty bland actually.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> is the only lotion I&#x27;ll use when I have dry, itchy skin because this is the only lotion that actually MAKES</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s runny and it had previously been rich and thick.</li>
            <li> Sorry it&#x27;s no longer available from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> My skin was so dry before I put this on.</li>
            <li> It has eliminated all the bumps and dry skin from my arms and feet.</li>
            <li> The only mineral listed is Dead Sea salt</li>
            <li> and before it was empty, I promptly went looking for a replacement.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have purchase a set of other products.  </li>
            <li> I still love the fragrance, but I&#x27;m disappointed in the composition...</li>
            <li> Not sweet, not powerfully floral, just a water scent I suppose.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to anybody who suffers from dry skin.</li>
            <li> However, sometimes the legs need a little moisturizer and that&#x27;s when I use this product.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little pricy but</li>
            <li> Little did I know.</li>
            <li> reminds me of something from when I was little.</li>
            <li> [...]    Pros: What I like about Seacret From the Dead Sea Body Lotion is it is so luxurious and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This says to me, immediately, that they don&#x27;t stand behind their product, which is a problem when you charge $50-$150 dollars for individual products.</li>
            <li> Yes, but no better than anything I could pick up at the drug store.</li>
            <li> but at least I know</li>
            <li> Seacret is keeping a secret!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the best lotion.  I love the smell, it is not overpowering like some others.  Buy it here, not at the mall where they will charge you much more!</li>
            <li> [...]    Pros: What I like about Seacret From the Dead Sea Body Lotion is it is so luxurious and moisturizing. My skin was so dry before I put this on. After I applied it, my skin just felt relaxed. This lotion has very nice ingredients that are wonderful for the skin such as; jojoba oil, sweet almond oil, avocado oil, algae extract, dead sea salt, and more. This lotion absorbed into my skin quickly and left in soft and moisturized.  Cons: The only cons I have is that the smell is a ocean or beachy type scent and I&#x27;m more of a sweet floral scent type gal. Also for such an amazing and luxurious lotion the packaging isn&#x27;t very luxurious or pretty. It is pretty bland actually. Though I don&#x27;t like the scent, when it is applied the scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming or anything. I actually don&#x27;t mind the scent after I put on the lotion. I would recommend putting the lotion on after a shower to seal in the moisture.</li>
            <li> Getting this lotion at a discounted price makes it even more worth the money.  A little goes a long way.  It really helps my dry skin. I received a great product, at a great price and got great service!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Highly recommend it.  Sorry it&#x27;s no longer available from Amazon.  Will look for it in the future.</li>
            <li> I got this in the gift set box and I only liked the nail buffer.This lotion smells nice but its not my favorite.</li>
            <li> For what I paid for this lotion I expected more. Did it moisturize? Yes, but no better than anything I could pick up at the drug store. As for the scent... well, it was very manly and I ended up giving the lotion to my husband.  All in all, I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, we&#x27;ve used the other products from this company and all are great.  It works!  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is amazing product.  I have used it before and I didn&#x27;t have purchase a set of other products.  This is one of the best body lotions that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Seacret is keeping a secret! I read the back of my Cucumber &amp; Melon Body Lotion. The only mineral listed is Dead Sea salt and it is the 3rd from the last item. What a rip!  Read the ingredients before you buy their products.</li>
            <li> I buy this lotion all the time and love it! It moisturizes without the greasy feel. It smells good without being overpowering and stays on after washing. I will buy this again and again. Love it!</li>
            <li> A brilliant product that moisturises the skin without being greasy.  The fragrance is lovely.  I would highly recommend it to anybody who suffers from dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not big on using lotion on my body because I believe the skin draws in the product and who knows what it does inside with the side effects of everything these days.  I don&#x27;t use makeup either...never liked the stuff.  However, sometimes the legs need a little moisturizer and that&#x27;s when I use this product.  I do love the lotion and the fact that its not greasy or stinky.  I probably only use it maybe 5 or 6 times a year but at least I know I have good quality help if I need it.&lt;br /&gt;I certainly do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> VERY NICE PRODUCT.  THE SCENT OCEAN IS VERY MILD &amp; THE LOTION IS WONDERFUL.  ISN&#x27;T STICKY.  ABSORBS INTO SKIN FAST.</li>
            <li> It has eliminated all the bumps and dry skin from my arms and feet. My skin hasn&#x27;t looked like this in years.</li>
            <li> this lotion smells SO good and works SO well! it&#x27;s a little pricy but well worth the price. i got this  in a manicure gift set but i will definitely buy more once i&#x27;m out!</li>
            <li> I had purchased this lotion some years ago when I was in Israel, so I was really excited to be able to order it.  I still love the fragrance, but I&#x27;m disappointed in the composition...it&#x27;s runny and it had previously been rich and thick.</li>
            <li> While visiting a friend in Florida, I tried this product and loved it so much, I asked if I could take it home!  She graciously gave it&lt;br /&gt;to me and before it was empty, I promptly went looking for a replacement. Found it on Amazon and ordered it.  It&#x27;s very rich and creamy, absorbs easily and lasts all day. I am very happy with this lotion.</li>
            <li> I really love this body lotion. It makes my skin so soft and smooth. Not to mention the fact that it has a nice fresh and clean scent.&lt;br /&gt;This is the only lotion I&#x27;ll use when I have dry, itchy skin because this is the only lotion that actually MAKES A DIFFERENCE.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 50+ woman with great skin who has tried many different types and brands of lotions. My husband thought he would pamper me and so bought me a lot of SeaCret for Christmas.  SeaCret proclaims to have many minerals that justify the high prices that they charge and, after having tried the products, I just can&#x27;t see the value.   When I tried to return some the products, unopened, the salesgirl said that they have a strict no-return policy. This says to me, immediately, that they don&#x27;t stand behind their product, which is a problem when you charge $50-$150 dollars for individual products. Their return policy was not disclosed when the purchase was made, however it was printed on the receipt that my husband received after the purchase.  The Nail Care Collection sells for $50 and has a buffing block, nail file, cuticle oil, and pomegranate body lotion.  The buffing block and nail file are the equivalent of the $1.50 styles in any beauty supply store. The cuticle oil is effective and not too greasy but not any different than what you would buy elsewhere. The pomegranate body lotion... I thought this must be worth the high price of the collection but, frankly, I prefer the thicker hand creams from Bath and Body Works, and Body Shop. The SeaCret body lotion consistency is quite like that of Vaseline Intensive Care lotion, although it does have more staying power than the Vaseline.   I will continue to use the SeaCret lotions that I have, simply because I can&#x27;t return them. When they&#x27;re gone, I&#x27;ll be back to Oil of Olay for my face, and Bath and Bpdy Works for body butters and lotions.</li>
            <li> I have been using  this product for years. It is very good for dry skin, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy  and smells very nice.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> As I was walking through the mall one day, one of the vendors approached me and proceeded to squeeze out one of these scents on my hand. I thought, whatever, it&#x27;s free, why not? Little did I know. This scent is extraordinarily soft, like the breeze of one of the purest seas out there, but lingering. Hours later, my hands remained supple and moisturized, and I really enjoyed the scent. It&#x27;s light, smells as close to the ocean as possible with a slight hint of florals thrown in there. Not sweet, not powerfully floral, just a water scent I suppose. Anyway, you just have to smell it for yourself, because my scent describing skills are pretty much non-existent, but once you do, you&#x27;ll fall for it like I did.</li>
            <li> I bought several tubes of this so I can carry one with me, keep one on the coffee table, and one on my night stand.  I use it several times a day with wonderful results.</li>
            <li> I first received this lotion as a gift from my daughter.  It&#x27;s scent is so pleasant and it works wonderfully to make my skin soft.  It&#x27;s priced a bit high, however, it is well worth it.  I would purchase it again as long as the price doesn&#x27;t go up any higher.</li>
            <li> I like Seacret Ocean Mist Body Lotion for it&#x27;s mild scent and moisturizing effect and have been using it for several years, but haven&#x27;t always ordered it from Amazon.  The price was right, so I will be ordering it again from Amazon when I run out.</li>
            <li> just love this lotion-smell reminds me of something from when I was little.</li>
            <li> Nice but takes a while to rub dry.</li>
            <li> I knew I liked this because I have had it before and was having a hard time finding it. I love how it smells and also how it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of different lotions to heal my cracked hands. Works great and doens&#x27;t leave a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> I get this every Christmas for my niece. She loves it.&lt;br /&gt;So not only a good product, but a good price.</li>
            <li> I just love this lotion. It is the best I have found and does not leave a greasy feeling. Great!</li>
            <li> Excellent product!!! Love love love.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It&#x27;s not greasy, absorbs fast, and smells great. I just wish it was sold in larger sizes, or a better deal if you buy more than one at a time.</li>
            <li> The best lotion you can buy</li>
