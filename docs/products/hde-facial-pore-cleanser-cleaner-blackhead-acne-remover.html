            <li>every week i love it thank you so much</li>
            <li>THIS LITTLE PORE CLEANSER WORKS GREAT ON MY BLACKHEADS.  </li>
            <li>old could have made more sense.  </li>
            <li>So far I am pleased with this item.</li>
            <li>This was worth a laugh.  </li>
            <li>there are many other products that works better than this and also cheaper than this</li>
            <li>But dang it, while it works it really works!</li>
            <li>All you need to do is put a HOT towel on your face and/or Have a mask on BEFORE you use this product.</li>
            <li>The suction was not always consistent.</li>
            <li>It is just what I wanted and very inexpensive!  </li>
            <li>Wet face with warm to hot water which opens pores and glide over face without  stopping.  </li>
            <li>IT DOES EXACTLY</li>
            <li>AND IT&#x27;S VEEERY LOUD!!!!</li>
            <li>I have had a positive experience with this product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what it could possiby be good for, but I&#x27;m certain it won&#x27;t help anyone&#x27;s blackhead situation.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>I was very dissapointed...</li>
            <li>and i saw this on amazon for a relatively reasonable price.</li>
            <li>does not have much strength</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>when opening the box it resembles a mini vibrator and vibrates as much as you would expect it to.</li>
            <li>I like it very much,because it is very suited for me.</li>
            <li>Was purchased as a gift and this present recipient was happy and I haven&#x27;t heard anything negative.</li>
            <li>Telling a friend that people have talked positively about her without her knowing always produces an unexpected thrill.</li>
            <li>Just glad it was on sale, and didn&#x27;t waste a lot on this thing.</li>
            <li>- Cheap plastic  - Battery slot is so tight that battery is not going.  </li>
            <li>If you truly want to Hoover out your blackheads, spend a little more money and get a Panasonic, or something that will actually work.</li>
            <li>I am surprised that Amazon even let this item be sold on their website.</li>
            <li>Some that had been on my chest for over a week are now completely gone.</li>
            <li>we should do a class action against this company</li>
            <li>Loud for no reason           </li>
            <li>The battery has to be changed fairly frequently if you use it a lot</li>
            <li>I bought it for my 13 year old son.</li>
            <li>product was a personal purchase at the normal retail price.</li>
            <li>But telling her that people who seem not to admire her so much, in fact, do admire her -- in some small, secret way -- makes her feel as if she&#x27;s done such an amazing job that she&#x27;s somehow wiped out jealousy and pettiness.</li>
            <li>- the instructions on the main board with pictures are also in some language other then English.  </li>

            <li> the vacuum finally gave up the ghost after a lot of continuous use.</li>
            <li> &gt;* Never generated enough vacuum (despite being on all the time) to work as advertised&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Absolute rubbish and a pointless object to manufacture</li>
            <li> Not sure, just received it so haven&#x27;t seen how it really works</li>
            <li> This is the most useless invention of all time, and a complete waste of money and time.  </li>
            <li> I thought it would  be more gentle on the skin than comedone extractor, but as it turns out, it is worthless.  </li>
            <li> It was a waste of money completely.</li>
            <li> A complete waste.</li>
            <li> It took a long time to arrive, but is one of the few items I&#x27;ve received from over seas somewhere that actually included instructions in english!</li>
            <li> I am reviewing it solely because I want to share my experience with other potential customers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really loud and sucks up a big hunk of skin, but it does nothing for blackheads.  </li>
            <li> I was having deep blackheads so after steaming and doing a nice mask, this product had no problem removing the clogged crap.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t remove a single blackhead.</li>
            <li> I only thought, the less I have to do with this manufacturer, the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It simply did not clean pores nor extract blackheads.</li>
            <li> Item was everything I expected.</li>
            <li> Second it does nothing for anything on the skin except waste your time.</li>
            <li> Whoever spent money on this should be reimbursed.  </li>
            <li> It has absolutely no suction power</li>
            <li> But this one is definitely not worth the time spent to ship it, the money spent to buy it the energy used by your computer to look at it.    </li>
            <li> One of the few products that I&#x27;ve simply thrown in the garbage rather than waste my time trying to get recompense for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth it folks, it doesn&#x27;t do what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> But darn it, it works a heck of a lot better and is way cheaper then crap like</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste money even if its not much.  </li>
            <li> From tiny little blackheads to rock hard lumps that are like having little tumors on my face.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no suction on this little tool.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pissssssssssss that i spent my hard earn money on this junk.  </li>
            <li> - Paid $11 for this stupid cheap item which should not even cost $1.  - DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM.</li>
            <li> This @$%&amp; is a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money on this garbage.</li>
            <li> i use mostly everyday</li>
            <li> I just wasted money.</li>
            <li> it came with some of the caps missing.  </li>
            <li> Instructions had no address or number to call and request replacement for the missing parts.</li>
            <li> Have had bad skin my whole life but use this every other day.  </li>
            <li> Worst product I&#x27;v ever spent&lt;br /&gt;Money on not worth time nor money and create more problems than it solves because it irritates your face</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of using this item every morning and night, my face still looked as bad as the pictures I took from the first day.</li>
            <li> It is also not very effective at cleaning pores.</li>
            <li> I hardly want to waste my time and energy</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work like it says and it is not magical at all.</li>
            <li> People aren&#x27;t kidding when they say this thing makes a lot of noise, it was like a small jet engine.  </li>
            <li> The rock hard ones are now fully popped.</li>
            <li> Rock hard ones on my chin - no more!</li>
            <li> The language in the instructions was ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> My husband would use it on him and it would take out all those ugly blackheads individually.</li>
            <li> And weak power ..</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and we are not very impressed with this at all.</li>
            <li> this item is waste of money!!!    </li>

            <li> posting on this useless product.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality ..</li>

            <li> This is why we have bad skin people.</li>
            <li> One Mad buyer!</li>
            <li> - the suction is so stupid, it does not reflect on your skin.  </li>
            <li> It is worthless.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Do not buy this item. It is worthless.  It&#x27;s simply a cylinder that claims to suck the dirt out of pores but it does no such thing.  I only wish I had read the reviews prior to ordering.  My mistake.  I hope you don&#x27;t make the same mistake.  I would like to see amazon remove this product from the site altogether to protect customers from being scammed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SERIOUSLY, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS POS ITEM.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do much. All it does it suck at my pores so impurities can get out but nope. I still have dirty pores. Maybe its just me but the probability is that it isn&#x27;t. I dislike this product.</li>
            <li> This product is a joke.  The language in the instructions was ridiculous.  A five yr. old could have made more sense.  There is no suction at all in this joke of a product.  Amazon should take this one off.  This product speaks poorly for Amazon.  One Mad buyer!</li>
            <li> I am surprised that Amazon even let this item be sold on their website. Is there a nice, kind, and polite way to say that this thing is a piece of junk?</li>
            <li> This machine did not work at all, and I would not recommend it to anyone.  Should have sent is back and got a refund.</li>
            <li> I have all types of acne. From tiny little blackheads to rock hard lumps that are like having little tumors on my face. I&#x27;ve read the arguments about these things, that they damage the skin, do more harm then good. But when you&#x27;re desperate and every prescription and over the counter product has failed you you&#x27;ll try anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having bought cheaper versions at the dollar store, I knew what to expect. A lot of noise, a big \\&quot;chunk\\&quot; of flesh sucked into the hole, eventually I fully expect this to lose suction and I&#x27;ll have to buy another. But dang it, while it works it really works! Some of my zits surfaced instantly and even popped, core and all. Others it took 24 hours before the pus came forth. Come forth it did! The rock hard ones are now fully popped. Some that had been on my chest for over a week are now completely gone. And if you could see all the yellow, waxy pus it removed from the pores on my cheeks you&#x27;d be both sickened and amazed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe this isn&#x27;t the recommended, dermatologist approved way to remove zits. But darn it, it works a heck of a lot better and is way cheaper then crap like Proactive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: So like I predicted, yesterday (June 10th) the vacuum finally gave up the ghost after a lot of continuous use. I don&#x27;t know if the engine was just too full of gunk from my skin, or if it burned out. But it stopped creating suction as I said it would. However, while it worked - YOWZA! Huge pimples on my neck, gone within 24 hours of use. Rock hard ones on my chin - no more! Heck, it even helped suck out junk from infected ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> this item is waste of money!!!    - Cheap plastic  - Battery slot is so tight that battery is not going.  - the suction is so stupid, it does not reflect on your skin.  - the instructions on the main board with pictures are also in some language other then English.  - Paid $11 for this stupid cheap item which should not even cost $1.  - DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM.</li>
            <li> Did not work as described.</li>
            <li> This @$%&amp; is a waste of time and money. It only does one thing.... NOTHING! doesn&#x27;t have the suction power to even leave your skin red. I honestly rate it one star cause you can&#x27;t rate lower than that.</li>
            <li> This product although arrived in fair time, did not work at all. It simply did not clean pores nor extract blackheads. After going over the directions thoroughly I came to the realization that it was not operation error, it was the product.&lt;br /&gt;Advice to potential buyer: Don&#x27;t buy unless you like throwing your money away!</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money. Does nothing! Didn&#x27;t remove a single blackhead. Worthless product. Needs to be taken off shelves and this site.</li>
            <li> People are CRAZY!!! This thing is GREAT!!!! All you need to do is put a HOT towel on your face and/or Have a mask on BEFORE you use this product. and then use it after your face is hot from a towel!!!! IT WORKED GREAT!!!! AMAZING!!!! BUY this NOW!!</li>
            <li> does just what it says it will</li>
            <li> I found a similar device for a good price that works way better.  You get what you pay for so don&#x27;t waste money even if its not much.  Upgrade and be satisfied.</li>
            <li> Item was everything I expected. Was purchased as a gift and this present recipient was happy and I haven&#x27;t heard anything negative.</li>
            <li> Saw this at amazon and it sounded like it would be an awesome product.  Well if it only delivered on what was promised.  The premise is there, but the suction isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and we are not very impressed with this at all. It doesn&#x27;t work like it says and it is not magical at all. It was a waste of money completely.</li>
            <li> this item is WORTHLESS!! I was very dissapointed... I was hoping it would work..for one the quality of the item is poor is a cheap plastic comparible to something you&#x27;d buy at the dollar store. Second it does nothing for anything on the skin except waste your time. DONT BUY you will be dissapointed</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money on this garbage. it didn&#x27;t take even one blackhead out..i wish i never bought it. there are many other products that works better than this and also cheaper than this</li>
            <li> \\&quot; Worst product I&#x27;v ever spent&lt;br /&gt;Money on not worth time nor money and create more problems than it solves because it irritates your face</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this piece of crap....and crap is a compliment.  I&#x27;m so pissssssssssss that i spent my hard earn money on this junk.  Whoever made this should be punched in the face repeatedly.  Whoever spent money on this should be reimbursed.  we should do a class action against this company</li>
            <li> This is the most useless invention of all time, and a complete waste of money and time.  Absolute rubbish and a pointless object to manufacture</li>
            <li> This is a must have in every home for dermatological hygeine.  We love how easy it is to use and maintain.</li>
            <li> I wanted a facial pore cleanser and i saw this on amazon for a relatively reasonable price. The item is fair however is not that practical and won&#x27;t fulfill your desire to remove blackheads as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think we need to pay more to get more :)</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t contact the seller after receiving this item. It has no filter in it to keep from clogging the item. It is also not very effective at cleaning pores. After 2 weeks of using this item every morning and night, my face still looked as bad as the pictures I took from the first day.</li>
            <li> I always wanted one of these pore cleanser things. But this one is definitely not worth the time spent to ship it, the money spent to buy it the energy used by your computer to look at it.    Pro&#x27;s: Cheap           Easy to transport           Easy to operate           Easy to change batteries    Con&#x27;s: Not enough suction power to cleanse anything.           Loud for no reason           Falls apart easily when dropped from 6, 4 and 3 inches in height.    IMPORTANT:DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> it was such an amazing product! i use mostly everyday i love it my skin now feels amazing thank you! .My mom uses this product as well she loved it we get to do our own facials at home</li>
            <li> this is a great product it work great i used it every week i love it thank you so much</li>
            <li> A complete waste. I doesn&#x27;t do any thing. I just wasted money. dont buy! I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to any one.</li>
            <li> does not have much strength , mmm I do not know , I do not get anything</li>
            <li> It did not work at all. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a super-powerful one so I wasn&#x27;t expecting amazing results, but it did do the job as I wanted. I was having deep blackheads so after steaming and doing a nice mask, this product had no problem removing the clogged crap.</li>
            <li> it was good, but I dropped it and it never worked again. I was very disappointed. The suction was not always consistent.</li>
            <li> Telling a friend that people have talked positively about her without her knowing always produces an unexpected thrill. But telling her that people who seem not to admire her so much, in fact, do admire her -- in some small, secret way -- makes her feel as if she&#x27;s done such an amazing job that she&#x27;s somehow wiped out jealousy and pettiness.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfull my teen age daughter loves it</li>
            <li> People aren&#x27;t kidding when they say this thing makes a lot of noise, it was like a small jet engine.  It has absolutely no suction power, thankfully I only paid $5 for it.  If you truly want to Hoover out your blackheads, spend a little more money and get a Panasonic, or something that will actually work.</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF SUCKS!!!!!! IT DOES NOTHING!!!!!!!!!!! WHY CAN&#x27;T I GIVE IT A 0 RATING?!?!  I GOT IT IN THE MAIL TODAY AND I THREW IT IN THE GARBAGE. THE INSTRUCTIONS IS GARBAGE!!!!!!!!! AND IT&#x27;S VEEERY LOUD!!!! SAVE UR TIME AND MONEUNAND PLEASE DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Very poor quality .. And weak power ..</li>
            <li> I was quite skeptical when purchasing an item like this, bought for the price I thought I would give it a try. It took a long time to arrive, but is one of the few items I&#x27;ve received from over seas somewhere that actually included instructions in english! It seems to  work well,  But I&#x27;ll have to see how it does over time. So far I am pleased with this item.</li>
            <li> It is just what I wanted and very inexpensive!  The battery has to be changed fairly frequently if you use it a lot but that just makes sense.  My son is also using it and likes it too.</li>
            <li> Does not have enough power to do what it supposed to do.  Just glad it was on sale, and didn&#x27;t waste a lot on this thing.</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT THANK YOU</li>
            <li> I recommend because is the describe in the page and have a excellent price I would buy another by the great efficiency</li>
            <li> Terrible! It does nothing more than make noise! Poor craftsmanship, if i could give negitive stars i would! Dont buy!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> not great&lt;br /&gt;This product was a personal purchase at the normal retail price. I am reviewing it solely because I want to share my experience with other potential customers. I did not purchase it in connection to a review company.  I have received no compensation for my review nor do I have any relationship with the seller or manufacturer of this product.  I have had a positive experience with this product it solved the issue that I purchased it for. I appreciate the opportunity to review this item</li>
            <li> I hardly want to waste my time and energy posting on this useless product. BUT, maybe I can save others from wasting their money on this product. It&#x27;s not worth it folks, it doesn&#x27;t do what it says it will do. I really don&#x27;t know what it would be good except for a way to throw one&#x27;s money away.</li>
            <li> This was worth a laugh.  It&#x27;s really loud and sucks up a big hunk of skin, but it does nothing for blackheads.  I&#x27;m not sure what it could possiby be good for, but I&#x27;m certain it won&#x27;t help anyone&#x27;s blackhead situation.</li>
            <li> Not sure, just received it so haven&#x27;t seen how it really works</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this tool becuase it came with some of the caps missing.  I really feel like I wasted my money on the tool I cannot use on myself or others.  I thought it would  be more gentle on the skin than comedone extractor, but as it turns out, it is worthless.  Instructions had no address or number to call and request replacement for the missing parts.</li>
            <li> Wet face with warm to hot water which opens pores and glide over face without  stopping.  Have had bad skin my whole life but use this every other day.  And look almost like everyone  else with help of Skinn am and pm facial washes.  Great if nothing  else works for you</li>
            <li> One of the few products that I&#x27;ve simply thrown in the garbage rather than waste my time trying to get recompense for. I only thought, the less I have to do with this manufacturer, the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Issues:&lt;br /&gt;* Flimsy&lt;br /&gt;* Once battery was inserted, stayed on regardless of the on/off switch position.&lt;br /&gt;* Never generated enough vacuum (despite being on all the time) to work as advertised&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend does not work as advertised for me.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my 13 year old son. My husband would use it on him and it would take out all those ugly blackheads individually.</li>
            <li> I dunno what i was thinking getting this haha. when opening the box it resembles a mini vibrator and vibrates as much as you would expect it to. There&#x27;s no suction on this little tool. This is why we have bad skin people. Because we buy stuff from China thinking it&#x27;ll work.</li>
            <li> THIS LITTLE PORE CLEANSER WORKS GREAT ON MY BLACKHEADS.  IT DOES EXACTLY WHAT IT SAYS IT DOES.  I WOULD RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE WITH BLACKHEADS.</li>
            <li> product has problems, had to tap it with my hand to get it to work, not enough suction to work properly</li>
            <li> I like it very much,because it is very suited for me.I think,next time.I will buy it again.</li>
