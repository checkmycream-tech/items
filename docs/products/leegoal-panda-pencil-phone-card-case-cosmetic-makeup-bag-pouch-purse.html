            <li>It&#x27;s really cute and fuzzy.</li>
            <li>so it looked more like a rabbit</li>
            <li>but my friend said it was really cute and asked to have it; she&#x27;s enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>, I just wish it looked more like the picture.</li>
            <li>However, when I put stuff in it the case looked a lot better</li>
            <li>and I love it now.</li>
            <li>Super cute &amp; plush!</li>
            <li>Just what I expected very nice!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Looks just like the picture... sweet and adorable.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made and the material easily comes apart.</li>
            <li>For under $3 and free shipping, it is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>I love it  very much</li>
            <li>super cute definetly worth the couple of bucks</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very cute and soft</li>
            <li>so I had to clean it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;People love it and its so soft, i love petting it during class.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>It was super cute and came really fast!</li>
            <li>Its super fuzzy/plushy.</li>
            <li>Overall happy with my purchase, did think the price was a tad high</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li>a while to arrive but worth the wait.</li>
            <li>(I paid ~$14 w/ship), but it is well worth it so no stars lost.</li>
            <li>Worth more than the actual price I would think.</li>
            <li>AT first when i received this, i was like ehhh..</li>
            <li>Very soft, fluffy, and cute!!</li>
            <li>It came really, really fast.</li>
            <li>Now I cant really use this anymore...</li>
            <li>A little smaller than what I originally thought, but nonetheless a nice item.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a cute product for a pencil case or hold non fragile cosmetics like lipgloss and lipsticks.</li>
            <li>Cute and fluffy.</li>
            <li>Shipping was kind of slow, but it&#x27;s shipped from China</li>
            <li>Similar to another comment, at first I didn&#x27;t like it because it came flat and dirty-looking (but not dirty).</li>
            <li>Pretty big too.</li>
            <li>was extremely scared to purchases this do to all the bad reviews but its exactly what was showed in the picture and that&#x27;s GREAT!!!</li>
            <li>later when you put stuff inside it, it really loooks</li>
            <li>I use it as a pencil case, but it&#x27;s decent in size, so you could use it for multiple things.</li>
            <li>Not much to it other than that.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that the pompom on the zipper pull does look very flimsy and looks like it will come right off if you pull the zipper too hard.</li>
            <li>However, it is not the most well made, durable product (as it is made in China) and seems a little fragile and I am afraid the little ball on the zipper might fall off when I use it but other than that it&#x27;s a very good product overall!</li>
            <li>The only thing that i kinda dont like is how easy the little black ball fell of the zipper.</li>
            <li>My only issue is the little black ball on the zipper comes off easily unless you retie it a different way.</li>

            <li> Cheaply made and the material easily comes apart. I couldn&#x27;t even use it for a day. I wish I took a picture but I threw it away,</li>
            <li> I never got it! I paid for it but I never received it! I am so mad! I wasted all that money! If you can I WANT my money back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very cute and soft I thought maybe it would be padded more. Overall, it&#x27;s a cute product for a pencil case or hold non fragile cosmetics like lipgloss and lipsticks.</li>

My only issue is the little black ball on the zipper comes off easily unless you retie it a different way.</li>
            <li> This panda case is just too adorable! I use it as a pencil case, but it&#x27;s decent in size, so you could use it for multiple things. It&#x27;s well made and fuzzy! I love it!</li>
            <li> It was a dirt and dusty when it came in the mail so I had to clean it. It is a cute case though.</li>
            <li> AT first when i received this, i was like ehhh.. my dad didnt like it.&lt;br /&gt;but later when you put stuff inside it, it really loooks adorable!&lt;br /&gt;People love it and its so soft, i love petting it during class.&lt;br /&gt;When i feel sleepy, i use it as my pillow during class haha.&lt;br /&gt;Its nice. :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sooo cute and I can&#x27;t wait to use it for school!! However, it is not the most well made, durable product (as it is made in China) and seems a little fragile and I am afraid the little ball on the zipper might fall off when I use it but other than that it&#x27;s a very good product overall! Very soft, fluffy, and cute!!</li>
            <li> it is great for my art supplies cause I carry around a small bag so this will work perfectly.</li>

            <li> So, so, so, so, soooo CUTE!! It came really, really fast. It fits 5 highlighters, 5 pens, 5 pencils, and 3 Sharpies. I know because that is what is in mine. My only concern is that if I leave the lead out when I put one of my pencils away they might rip the inside. Worth more than the actual price I would think.</li>
            <li> I like it, It is so cute!</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loves panda ...perfect for her</li>
            <li> Well when it came, one the ears was torn but apart from that it&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li> ðŸ˜½ purrrfect, my nice and I is pleased.&lt;br /&gt;I was extremely scared to purchases this do to all the bad reviews but its exactly what was showed in the picture and that&#x27;s GREAT!!! ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
            <li> Just what I expected very nice!</li>
            <li> Very cute! Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Took a while to arrive but worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I use this little pouch for everything.</li>
            <li> Cute and fluffy. The sewing work isn&#x27;t the best but it seems durable enough for its use. Pretty big too.</li>
            <li> A really great product! Came in 2 weeks before posted arrival date which was a great plus!</li>
            <li> Love it! Super cute &amp; plush! It can be washed in a washing machine when it gets dirty and still looks gerat--no shrinkage or anything. I have used it for 1 year and it is still holding up beautifully! Just toss in with delicates, I still wouldn&#x27;t take the chance of messing it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The inside lining is cute also! It looks reversible, but I love looking at the panda. Nothing has broken, thankfully. Would purchase again. Shipping was kind of slow, but it&#x27;s shipped from China so...yea. Overall happy with my purchase, did think the price was a tad high (I paid ~$14 w/ship), but it is well worth it so no stars lost.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this. Its super fuzzy/plushy. Its a good size. I&#x27;ve used it as both a pencil case and a make up bag. I&#x27;ve gotten many complements on it. Everyone loves it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really cute and fuzzy. However after about three months, the zipper just messed up and wont zip it up. Now I cant really use this anymore...</li>
            <li> Very cute, great price! The only thing is that the pompom on the zipper pull does look very flimsy and looks like it will come right off if you pull the zipper too hard.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift for my sister, she hasn&#x27;t mentioned anything about the pom pom coming off like other reviews. She loves it and it is a good size, fits many things.</li>
            <li> It was super cute and came really fast!</li>
            <li> Personally I didn&#x27;t like it; it was not as shown. The ear were very long so it looked more like a rabbit and they were crooked to boot. I would rate it lower but my friend said it was really cute and asked to have it; she&#x27;s enjoyed it. It works well, I just wish it looked more like the picture.</li>
            <li> Best pencil pouch i&#x27;ve ever gotten, exactly as described from seller. It&#x27;s fuzzy and cute and  use it for school, most all of my friends are jealous, some of them even bought it! Even in college, I guess you can&#x27;t refuse that cute fuzzy look, fits nicely in bag and I can even put my cords for ipod in there, it fits everything wonderfully, and I would buy it again in a heartbeat!</li>
            <li> Similar to another comment, at first I didn&#x27;t like it because it came flat and dirty-looking (but not dirty). However, when I put stuff in it the case looked a lot better and I love it now. For under $3 and free shipping, it is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> it breaks easily the zipper will break !!</li>
            <li> Purrfect I love it  very much</li>
