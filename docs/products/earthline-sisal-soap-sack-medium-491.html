    <ol>
            <li>This Sisal soap bag is Awesome!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Travel-wise, this isn&#x27;t ideal.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>but I couldn&#x27;t beleive it could be that good.</li>
            <li>I also thought it would be good for exfoliating.</li>
            <li>Good for knees and ankle parts.</li>
            <li>so I get that nice exfoliated skin feel after a good work out.</li>
            <li>Nice size and color</li>
            <li>This Soap Sack is the perfect texture - really scrubby but doesn&#x27;t rub your skin off.</li>
            <li>But, I have to say, I love love love it!!</li>
            <li>My soap bubbles up wonderfully and its really soft against my skin.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve used much better products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Until I figure out a better use or throw it away, this is keeping my soap from sliding off the ledge in the shower for now.</li>
            <li>Wasnt sure how I was gonna like this product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>so I guess it&#x27;s ok for the price :)</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>Thought this would be a more earth friendly replacement for the nylon mesh soap savers, but the product just doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>lol... suffice to say I wnt back to the Gentle Loop version</li>
            <li>Soap quickly changes to mush.</li>
            <li>It looks like more air can enter it so it should be softer and dry better.  </li>
            <li>The exfoliating part works fine but the sack started unravelling in about a month, so much so that it wouldn&#x27;t keep the soap in.</li>
            <li>I bought two just because I knew I&#x27;d have to throw it out after a little while, but for the time being I&#x27;m still using the first one and it is working great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s stiffer (rougher) and provides a more deep scrubbing of sorts.</li>
            <li>I keep buying these type of products that fall apart after the first use.</li>
            <li>Recommend washing it before first use, as you would anything you put against your skin.</li>
            <li>Thought I&#x27;d just try it, all the reviews seemed to be so positive</li>
            <li>Well I had the \\&quot;Gentle</li>
            <li>It does not work well for the face/ears, but works very well for the rest of the body.</li>
            <li>Soap chunks/pieces stay in the bag very well too.</li>
            <li>I tried the regular soap sack and it was too soft, this one was more of what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Edited: 02/05/16  Not the same quality as my original purchase.  </li>
            <li>I spent a long time looking for a good quality soap holder.</li>
            <li>I found this bag to be very soft!</li>
            <li>and I THOUGHT I wanted to get a little more exfoliation....</li>
            <li>This one is working well and it stays nice and abrasive for the life of a bar of soap at least.</li>
            <li>I only wish that the clasp that holds the opening closed were able to lock somehow but other than that it  is fine.</li>
            <li>but I look forward to the new one that I ordered.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li>This one seems to be sturdy and last for a decent amount of uses.</li>
            <li>It takes forever to dry and the drawstring/rope must be purely decorative because it doesn&#x27;t cinch up the sack to hold the soap in.</li>
            <li>so I would definitely not advise for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I can barely get any soap to come out when I lather it.</li>
            <li>The new ones don&#x27;t last and just fall apart after a short period.    </li>
            <li>Does not dry out.  </li>
            <li>The only downside is that because it is made of natural fibers it won&#x27;t last as long as a synthetic soap holder.</li>

            <li> Edited: 02/05/16  Not the same quality as my original purchase.  The new ones don&#x27;t last and just fall apart after a short period.    If you like the rougher feel this Soap Sack is what you want.  It&#x27;s stiffer (rougher) and provides a more deep scrubbing of sorts. I tried the regular soap sack and it was too soft, this one was more of what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Well I had the \\&quot;Gentle Loop\\&quot; version of this brand and I THOUGHT I wanted to get a little more exfoliation.... this was like using 60 - 100 grit sandpaper on my skin lol... suffice to say I wnt back to the Gentle Loop version</li>
            <li> This Sisal soap bag is Awesome!!! Thought I&#x27;d just try it, all the reviews seemed to be so positive but I couldn&#x27;t beleive it could be that good. I WAS WRONG!!! You feel 100 times cleaner after your shower when you use this soap bag. Wash cloths have become a thing of the past now!</li>
            <li> Works well.  Has held up and no mold (as I feared might develop) in sight.  The sisal is quite abrasive so I would definitely not advise for sensitive skin.  I like that&#x27;s it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li> I keep buying these type of products that fall apart after the first use. Make me so angry. This one is working well and it stays nice and abrasive for the life of a bar of soap at least. I take it to the gym with me so I get that nice exfoliated skin feel after a good work out. I love it. This one seems to be sturdy and last for a decent amount of uses. I only wish that the clasp that holds the opening closed were able to lock somehow but other than that it  is fine. 5 stars from me.</li>
            <li> I wanted something that was exfoliating, saved all the bits and pieces from my soap and traveled well. This doesn&#x27;t do any one those well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a start, it sheds with use. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times and every time some of the natural fibers fall out and are left on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For exfoliating purposes, I&#x27;ve used much better products. Using this is likes rubbing a soggy mini sack made of coarse, woven rope on your skin. Unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Travel-wise, this isn&#x27;t ideal. It takes forever to dry and the drawstring/rope must be purely decorative because it doesn&#x27;t cinch up the sack to hold the soap in. The material is just too thick and bulky. This non-drying attribute will probably make this unsanitary over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until I figure out a better use or throw it away, this is keeping my soap from sliding off the ledge in the shower for now. Some people like it, but it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li> Does not dry out.  Soap quickly changes to mush.</li>
            <li> I bought this to keep my natural soap from getting watery and being wasted from sitting in water. I also thought it would be good for exfoliating. Unfortunately the bag is way too rough and hurts my skin. I can barely get any soap to come out when I lather it. Now I just use it to hold my soap but even then it gets fibers stuck in my soap. Would not recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> I wanted an exfoliating soap holder.  The exfoliating part works fine but the sack started unravelling in about a month, so much so that it wouldn&#x27;t keep the soap in.</li>
            <li> Wasnt sure how I was gonna like this product only b/c I have never used one before. But, I have to say, I love love love it!! My soap bubbles up wonderfully and its really soft against my skin. Just wish it came in a larger size b/c I use some really oddly shaped soaps. I would definitely order another should I need too.</li>
            <li> The bag fell apart within a few uses. Didn&#x27;t even last a few days. Disappointed</li>
            <li> Nice size and color but I wish I can reverse the bag inside out because it seems softer inside. Good for knees and ankle parts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay I thought it&#x27;d be tighter but I got 2 for the price of one so I guess it&#x27;s ok for the price :)</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> Very thin mesh. Thought this would be a more earth friendly replacement for the nylon mesh soap savers, but the product just doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> Not quite what I expected but still serves the purpose I bought it for in an acceptable manner. Has a rougher exterior then I would like but works okay.</li>
            <li> I spent a long time looking for a good quality soap holder. This Soap Sack is the perfect texture - really scrubby but doesn&#x27;t rub your skin off. The only downside is that because it is made of natural fibers it won&#x27;t last as long as a synthetic soap holder. I bought two just because I knew I&#x27;d have to throw it out after a little while, but for the time being I&#x27;m still using the first one and it is working great.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why others are claiming this soap bag is &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34;. Providing you are using water in your showers, it shouldn&#x27;t be! I found this bag to be very soft! Recommend washing it before first use, as you would anything you put against your skin. This bag may &amp;#34;seem&amp;#34; rough when dry, but once soap is in it and it has obtained water from the shower, it is VERY soft! It does not work well for the face/ears, but works very well for the rest of the body. Soap chunks/pieces stay in the bag very well too.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t last me but a couple of months</li>
            <li> This soap sack is scratchy even when soaked in water.  Some people might like the exfoliation this sisal soap sack produces but I need something softer.  At the end of my shower I took the soap out to dry thoroughly and rinsed the sisal sack and let it dry completely empty because it seemed a little thick.  I have ordered another soap sack from a different seller.  It looks like more air can enter it so it should be softer and dry better.  Although this Sisal Soap Sack is made well and it should last a long time if I planned to use it... but I look forward to the new one that I ordered.</li>
