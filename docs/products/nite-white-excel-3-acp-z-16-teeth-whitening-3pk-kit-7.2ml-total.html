            <li>These work great and did not give me any  tooth sensitivity issues.</li>
            <li>which can greatly effect the efficacy of the product.</li>
            <li>Great product at a great price.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the brand prescribed by my dentist which worked great</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be happy to know you&#x27;ll notice a difference after just one try.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>nice product, very good price.</li>
            <li>My teeth look amazing!</li>
            <li>Whitening them once a week was suitable for great results.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and the product works great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product, you will no doubt be satisfied.</li>
            <li>Item does not seem effective.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very important for myself.</li>
            <li>so I needed more of this product to whiten them up again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I followed her suggestion.</li>
            <li>ok no problem  except order incomplete</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m am enjoyed this product because it changes my life.</li>
            <li>this is my favorite teeth whitening kit.</li>
            <li>Nite White is a very good and safety product.</li>
            <li>The trays were comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is MUCH cheaper on Amazon than at the dentist office and you could probably get a kit at the drug store to make your own trays.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping results.</li>
            <li>I have only used them a couple of times but am very satisfied with the product and the service.</li>
            <li>I used Rembrandt a few months ago and experienced a lot of discomfort without any whitening results.  </li>
            <li>This is the second time I&#x27;ve been using this whitening and it works amazingly.</li>
            <li>but this item is well worth the money</li>
            <li>It seems to be doing the job (used it for 5 nghts and my teeth look nice and white.)</li>
            <li>Nite White Excel is a great whitening product - I originally got it from my dentist who also made trays for my upper and lower teeth.</li>
            <li>But for someone who needs just a little bit of whitening this is good.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t use it everyday because my teeth were getting a bit too bright.</li>
            <li>I could tell a difference after the first use and my teeth continue to get whiter with each application.  </li>
            <li>My dentist first gave me this but charges about $53 each.  </li>
            <li>I initially purchased this product from my dentist in 2007 to whiten after braces and before some more dental work.  </li>
            <li>The formula is the same except the addition of the mint flavor and more anti-sensitivity &#x27;stuff&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>I had to buy a $20 mold at the store as the cheap ones I ordered just shriveled up or fit loosely.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works -</li>
            <li>It does very well.</li>
            <li>I recently had a dental procedure and had to use special mouthwash which made my teeth turn brownish</li>
            <li>every six months...and will continue to use it as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, my teeth are feeling quite sensitive today - one in particular so be aware this may be a side effect.</li>
            <li>A quick websearch shows that Phillips bought the original company a few years ago.</li>
            <li>I paid a fraction of what it formerly cost me at the dentist&#x27;s office and it was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>if you have sensitive teeth like I do, don&#x27;t use too much or every night.</li>
            <li>Exactly the same whitener I paid five times as much for at my dentist.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than the 100 buck price tage the dentist gets for the exact same product.  </li>
            <li>You squirt a tiny bit of this into the trays and sleep in them and can tell a difference right away.</li>
            <li>a very natural look is achieved with this product.</li>
            <li>Go easy, but it really works well, and the price is unbelievable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the exact same thing they gave me at the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>Most people find it hard to believe that I don&#x27;t whiten my teeth professionally.</li>
            <li>and I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants whiter teeth.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>this does whiten teeth but leaves them really sensitive</li>
            <li>I would suggest purchasing directly from a dentist as they regulate storage conditions (temperature changes, etc.)</li>
            <li>thanks to Nite White...</li>
            <li>Used this last night and the initial results are very positive.</li>
            <li>quick delivery much earlier than expected</li>
            <li>Since that initial whitening, I only use this for a night or two every six&#x27;ish months to maintain a white smile.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i finally got a new onebut I got ripped off-&lt;br /&gt;fredric lane</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased the same product from a different web site before and it worked very well.</li>
            <li>If you are using this product every day, be aware that your teeth may become more sensitive and even painful.</li>

            <li> The package was a clear case not black and green, but the ACP and 16% matched on the package description.  </li>
            <li> The effects of this product last for years, so there is not a whole lot of upkeep, even for a daily coffee drinker like me.</li>
            <li> My teeth were a few yellow and with Nite White</li>
            <li> yes, but I don&#x27;t want it obvious, and to be glowing in the dark.</li>
            <li> The results are quick to show and don&#x27;t leave my teeth with an artificial looking white...</li>
            <li> Nite White Excel works quite well, initially a little too well.</li>
            <li> Sleeping flat gave me reflux I found, slight inclined solved it.</li>
            <li> I use a 45* foam wedge to sleep with my head up when using this as it ends up dripping down my throat all night from my mouth salivating since the inserts keep you mouth open slightly.</li>
            <li> A little goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> so I have to do it every other day.</li>
            <li> I did not receive Nite White and not really sure what Philips Zoom is but not putting it on my teeth.</li>
            <li> I should have read the other reviews before ordering.</li>
            <li> So far I have not experienced any discomfort</li>
            <li> I have only used it for three days, but have noticed subtle changes.</li>
            <li> emerson clock radio came to me broken not new cracked case and a photo copy of the instruction</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it to be as irritating to my gums as other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> No need for other expensive whitening products!</li>
            <li> Waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> And, I have had not problem with the expiration dates, never has been outdated.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this product is 100% fake</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to pay for expensive pro treatments.</li>
            <li> This product is fake and it does not work!</li>

            <li> Used this last night and the initial results are very positive. Teeth are noticably whiter.&lt;br /&gt;However, my teeth are feeling quite sensitive today - one in particular so be aware this may be a side effect.</li>
            <li> nice product, very good price.</li>
            <li> I received the mold making kit and received the completed whitening trays within 10 days. The trays were comfortable and easy to use. I have only used them a couple of times but am very satisfied with the product and the service.</li>
            <li> second time I&#x27;ve used this brand, works</li>
            <li> These are what my wife wanted. Said they work well.</li>
            <li> Exactly the same whitener I paid five times as much for at my dentist. This stuff really works - if you have sensitive teeth like I do, don&#x27;t use too much or every night. Go easy, but it really works well, and the price is unbelievable. A little goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to whiten teeth. No need for other expensive whitening products! The effects of this product last for years, so there is not a whole lot of upkeep, even for a daily coffee drinker like me.</li>
            <li> Nite White Excel works quite well, initially a little too well. I couldn&#x27;t use it everyday because my teeth were getting a bit too bright. White yes, but I don&#x27;t want it obvious, and to be glowing in the dark. Whitening them once a week was suitable for great results. It&#x27;s a great product, you will no doubt be satisfied.</li>
            <li> Nite White Excel is a great whitening product - I originally got it from my dentist who also made trays for my upper and lower teeth.

            <li> I feel like i needed something stronger. But for someone who needs just a little bit of whitening this is good.</li>
            <li> Best product for the best price!!!!</li>
            <li> Not god, diden´t Work at al.</li>
            <li> Received in a very short amount of time.  And, have had no problem with the product.  Does as well as what I get at the dentist.  And, I have had not problem with the expiration dates, never has been outdated.</li>
            <li> This product is fake and it does not work! I&#x27;ve purchased the same product from a different web site before and it worked very well. In my opinion, this product is 100% fake and I would not recommend it to anyone! Waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and the product works great!</li>
            <li> My dentist first gave me this but charges about $53 each.  So I get it here and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!!</li>
            <li> Quick shipping results. I already had trays made from my dentist.  This product is a fraction of the cost that I was going to pay to my dentist.  I just hope the product lives up to its claims.  I have only used it for three days, but have noticed subtle changes.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than the 100 buck price tage the dentist gets for the exact same product.  Watch the strenght %s&lt;br /&gt;because tooth sensitivity will happen with the stronger ones.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve been using this whitening and it works amazingly. I leave it on all night and already call tell a difference the next morning. I have sensitive teeth so I have to do it every other day. If you are using this product every day, be aware that your teeth may become more sensitive and even painful. For that reason I have to skip a day or two. Two syringes were enough for me.</li>
            <li> this does whiten teeth but leaves them really sensitive so would advise not to use every night&lt;br /&gt;the only downside is a lot of air bubbles in the tube but this item is well worth the money&lt;br /&gt;very quick delivery much earlier than expected</li>
            <li> These work great and did not give me any  tooth sensitivity issues. 3 applications over a week or two and you could see the difference. I think I&#x27;m going to apply every Fri. and sat night to have whiter teeth the following week and as not to bombard my teeth/gums with the &#x27;bleaching&#x27; solution. I had to buy a $20 mold at the store as the cheap ones I ordered just shriveled up or fit loosely. I use a 45* foam wedge to sleep with my head up when using this as it ends up dripping down my throat all night from my mouth salivating since the inserts keep you mouth open slightly. Sleeping flat gave me reflux I found, slight inclined solved it.</li>
            <li> I did not receive Nite White and not really sure what Philips Zoom is but not putting it on my teeth. I should have read the other reviews before ordering.</li>
            <li> I sleep with my trays all night. It does very well.</li>
            <li> My friend, who is a dental assistant, recommended this product. They use this in their dental office. I&#x27;m glad I followed her suggestion. This is the best whitening product I&#x27;ve tried. I don&#x27;t find it to be as irritating to my gums as other products I&#x27;ve tried. The results are quick to show and don&#x27;t leave my teeth with an artificial looking white...a very natural look is achieved with this product. I&#x27;ve received lots of compliments since starting this. I&#x27;ve used it through 3 cycles..every six months...and will continue to use it as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> ok no problem  except order incomplete</li>
            <li> Nite White is a very good and safety product. It&#x27;s a medical care and you must be carfull in using it. I&#x27;m am enjoyed this product because it changes my life. My teeth were a few yellow and with Nite White I think it&#x27;s miraculous then my teeth are white now. It&#x27;s very important for myself.</li>
            <li> Item does not seem effective. I would suggest purchasing directly from a dentist as they regulate storage conditions (temperature changes, etc.) which can greatly effect the efficacy of the product.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price.  I paid a fraction of what it formerly cost me at the dentist&#x27;s office and it was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Why pay the price the dentists charge - it you have the molds pick the correct strength and you are good to go!</li>
            <li> I did not receive the product I ordered!!  They sent me a similar type product, but not the Brand I ordered. I ordered the brand prescribed by my dentist which worked great which is why I ordered it. I felt this was a bait &amp; switch.  Amazon should remove this merchant !!!</li>
            <li> My teeth look amazing! thanks to Nite White... this is my favorite teeth whitening kit. Most people find it hard to believe that I don&#x27;t whiten my teeth professionally. You&#x27;ll be happy to know you&#x27;ll notice a difference after just one try.</li>
            <li> Great product.  My dentist charges 3 times this amount.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the exact same thing they gave me at the dentist&#x27;s office. Now that I have the molds of my teeth, I get this once or twice a year and I don&#x27;t have to pay for expensive pro treatments.</li>
            <li> emerson clock radio came to me broken not new cracked case and a photo copy of the instruction sheet-&lt;br /&gt;I paid additional to get it in 1-3 days took 12 days-&lt;br /&gt;i finally got a new onebut I got ripped off-&lt;br /&gt;fredric lane</li>
            <li> I ordered this product based on the fact that the package in the picture looked the same as what I&#x27;ve had before.  When I recieved the product the packaging looked different and said Nite White Zoom instead of Excel 3.  The package was a clear case not black and green, but the ACP and 16% matched on the package description.  It seems to be doing the job (used it for 5 nghts and my teeth look nice and white.)</li>
            <li> I initially purchased this product from my dentist in 2007 to whiten after braces and before some more dental work.  I used it for 1 week and had to stop because it was working to well!  Since that initial whitening, I only use this for a night or two every six&#x27;ish months to maintain a white smile. (I want white not flourescent)  I&#x27;ve had lots of compliments and people can&#x27;t believe that it&#x27;s a do it yourself process.  I ordered this set from this seller in 2013 and in 2015 have just finished that order and placed another.  Before I ordered I read the concerns over the packaging and possible product changes. A quick websearch shows that Phillips bought the original company a few years ago. The formula is the same except the addition of the mint flavor and more anti-sensitivity &#x27;stuff&#x27;.  If it&#x27;s not the same I will definitely be back to update.  It has been a great product for me!</li>
