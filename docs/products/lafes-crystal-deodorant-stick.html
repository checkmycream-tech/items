            <li>I just got this for my daughter and its wonderful.</li>
            <li>After bathing I use the crystal, then spray on Burt&#x27;s, that works great for me.</li>
            <li>I suspect it would be good to avoid even this form</li>
            <li>Now, we&#x27;ve started using it in the bath tub (more than 10 feet away from granite!)</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>but this one seems very secure.</li>

            <li>Seems to work better than the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive pits.</li>
            <li>its a huge money save</li>
            <li>it shatters and makes for scratchy application till the shattered edges smooth out again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to use things that aren&#x27;t harmful to us or our environment.</li>
            <li>really fairly cheap too...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product, in general.</li>
            <li>No chemicals and no unpleasant body odor.</li>
            <li>I would think of a regular crystal and wonder how the heck that would be effective.  </li>
            <li>Now, I would reapply at this point, but since this stick is unscented, the bo smell just get&#x27;s absorbed by the stick and the stick smells.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>Other products made by this company are good, but not this stone.</li>
            <li>This product works pretty well even though I perspire quite a bit.  </li>

            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t achieve much.</li>
            <li>Really does deodorize the whole day!&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>issue is that after shaving, applying the crystal really stings.</li>
            <li>And this thing REALLY works.  </li>
            <li>you are looking for an aluminum free deodorant that actually works, try Meow Meow Tweet&#x27;s Deodorant Cream.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t say that it eliminates all BO, but it is certainly better than the other products I&#x27;ve tried that don&#x27;t contain aluminum chlorhydrate.  </li>
            <li>This brand doesn&#x27;t last for me for more than a few hours (and that&#x27;s not even with significant sweating).  </li>
            <li>After a long day out and about, including workouts, not only do I smell good, I also stopped getting that yellow stain on the pit of my shirts.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for all the sweaty folks out there</li>
            <li>The shipping is kinda high off of amazon, so you might want to buy it elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I have used the others (the Thai one) and a few more....</li>
            <li>Especially if the guy who recommended it was truthful in how long it lasts, he said that his 1 crystal deodorant lasted about 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love for them to make a little wrist loop for their clumsier customers!</li>
            <li>The real test will be next summer when it is 95 and humid...</li>
            <li>My only grumble is that the whole stick is exposed...</li>
            <li>My mom&#x27;s sensitive to fragrances</li>
            <li>it lasts anywhere near 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s actually a stick of natural mineral salt that you dampen and apply.  </li>
            <li>I started using crystal deodorant sticks nearly 20 years ago and haven&#x27;t looked back.</li>
            <li>Ive had some that barely stay in the holder</li>
            <li>Maybe I need to give my body time to adjust to this new product, but I had to go buy a regular white solid stick to supplement this one.</li>
            <li>Those two together have worked super well for the past several years.  </li>
            <li>I hate to only give 3 stars, because this product is SO GOOD!</li>
            <li>Then, by the time my wife and I sit down for dinner or get ready for bed, I can almost smell myself.</li>
            <li>Got this for my husband who has an active high stress job.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe I do sweat just a little bit less, but really the biggest thing I have noticed is that I have to be really working</li>

            <li> This does exactly what I hoped my deodorant should, without making anyone sick because of a strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> No real difference as compared to the Axe/Old Spice kinds with respect to the deodorant powers and since this is natural and less harmful to the skin</li>

            <li> I know that this product contains Aluminum, but the molecule is larger than other forms and is said to not penetrate the skin.  </li>
            <li> but this one is above average.</li>
            <li> I tried regular deodorant sticks and they were a mess and stained shirts.</li>
            <li> But by the time I get home, I&#x27;m starting to smell a little.</li>
            <li> After shower just wet the stone and apply.</li>
            <li> deodorant has absolutely NO scent at all.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> By that, I mean that it actually works for a short period.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what they put in this and how it differs from the other crystal deodorant sticks around  -</li>
            <li> , this is a common problem with all mineral salt based products apparently</li>
            <li> (other brands can be rolled up &amp; down)</li>
            <li> wife and I started using it over the sink on our granite counter tops before reading the instructions and the spots this product left over on the granite caused the sheen to go away and dull spots were formed on the granite</li>
            <li> Just not worth the effort to return it.</li>
            <li> I apply in the morning as directed by wetting it and rubbing on my underarms and it keeps the odor away while I&#x27;m at work (a sit down office job).</li>
            <li> I have to set a paper towel down under it.</li>
            <li> Bought this brand after seeing my previous one (Wind Salt) go up in price by over a dollar since I bought it a year ago.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical because there&#x27;s 1 main ingredient</li>
            <li> This one works for a little bit.</li>
            <li> The stick falls out of the plastic and is messy.</li>
            <li> I was using the Arm &amp; Hammer brand (without parabens) and was never totally confident with it.  </li>
            <li> /sweating hard to have ANY sweat smell at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t have to worry about putting lots of crazy chemicals from commercial stuff on my skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t leave it in water, standing or running, because, duh, it&#x27;s made of salt.</li>
            <li> but we found out too late!</li>
            <li> But it arrived broken.</li>
            <li> But if I wait a few hours after shaving it is not so bad.</li>
            <li> I apply it in the morning and even after I&#x27;m done with 8 hours at work and then maybe an hour at the gym, the smell isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;And holy crap.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I ordered this and the Kiss My Face brand roll-on. This one doesn&#x27;t achieve much. The Kiss My Face one is much better.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband who has an active high stress job.  He says it works perfectly with no irritation.  The real test will be next summer when it is 95 and humid...</li>
            <li> Works well but I also couple it with Burt&#x27;s Bees Sage spray on. Those two together have worked super well for the past several years.  After bathing I use the crystal, then spray on Burt&#x27;s, that works great for me. And I don&#x27;t have to worry about putting lots of crazy chemicals from commercial stuff on my skin.</li>
            <li> The best. No chemicals and no unpleasant body odor. Don&#x27;t leave it in water, standing or running, because, duh, it&#x27;s made of salt.</li>
            <li> Really does deodorize the whole day!&lt;br /&gt;Only issue is that after shaving, applying the crystal really stings. But if I wait a few hours after shaving it is not so bad.</li>
            <li> The word &amp;#34;crystal&amp;#34; made me a skeptic of this type of deodorant for years.  I would think of a regular crystal and wonder how the heck that would be effective.  But it&#x27;s actually a stick of natural mineral salt that you dampen and apply.  And this thing REALLY works.  I was using the Arm &amp; Hammer brand (without parabens) and was never totally confident with it.  This Lafes Crystal Deodorant Stick is a gazillion times better.  I&#x27;m 100% confident.</li>
            <li> I never thought I&#x27;d be one to wear a crystal deodorant.  I love this stuff and I do not smell or sweat.  This stuff is awesome</li>
            <li> I really Love this deodorant. I have used the others (the Thai one) and a few more....but this really leaves me dry and feeling confident all day. I just forget that I have armpits! I don&#x27;t know what they put in this and how it differs from the other crystal deodorant sticks around  - but this one is above average. My only grumble is that the whole stick is exposed...(other brands can be rolled up &amp; down) so if you drop it. it shatters and makes for scratchy application till the shattered edges smooth out again. I&#x27;d love for them to make a little wrist loop for their clumsier customers!</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve never had a lot of body odor, so I thought I&#x27;d give this a shot. It&#x27;s a good product, in general. I apply in the morning as directed by wetting it and rubbing on my underarms and it keeps the odor away while I&#x27;m at work (a sit down office job). But by the time I get home, I&#x27;m starting to smell a little. Then, by the time my wife and I sit down for dinner or get ready for bed, I can almost smell myself. Now, I would reapply at this point, but since this stick is unscented, the bo smell just get&#x27;s absorbed by the stick and the stick smells. Maybe I need to give my body time to adjust to this new product, but I had to go buy a regular white solid stick to supplement this one.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about it or tell enough people to use this. It&#x27;s important to use things that aren&#x27;t harmful to us or our environment. After a long day out and about, including workouts, not only do I smell good, I also stopped getting that yellow stain on the pit of my shirts. My mom&#x27;s sensitive to fragrances, that&#x27;s why I bought this. I was skeptical because there&#x27;s 1 main ingredient and I&#x27;ve tried similar deodorants that just don&#x27;t work. My entire family uses it and it lasts. This does exactly what I hoped my deodorant should, without making anyone sick because of a strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> Quite some ago I decided to try to avoid deodorants containing Aluminum due to its possible link to Alzheimer&#x27;s and cancer.  I know that this product contains Aluminum, but the molecule is larger than other forms and is said to not penetrate the skin.  I suspect it would be good to avoid even this form but I need to use a deodorant that works.  This product works pretty well even though I perspire quite a bit.  I won&#x27;t say that it eliminates all BO, but it is certainly better than the other products I&#x27;ve tried that don&#x27;t contain aluminum chlorhydrate.  People are different and this might not work for you but it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it is suppose too.  Just remember this is NOT an antiperspirant therefore will not keep you from sweating but will keep from being all smelly.  After shower just wet the stone and apply.</li>
            <li> Excellent deodorant, no complaints on that section... I apply it in the morning and even after I&#x27;m done with 8 hours at work and then maybe an hour at the gym, the smell isn&#x27;t too bad. No real difference as compared to the Axe/Old Spice kinds with respect to the deodorant powers and since this is natural and less harmful to the skin, I would gladly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife and I started using it over the sink on our granite counter tops before reading the instructions and the spots this product left over on the granite caused the sheen to go away and dull spots were formed on the granite, this is a common problem with all mineral salt based products apparently but we found out too late! Now, we&#x27;ve started using it in the bath tub (more than 10 feet away from granite!) to prevent any further damage.</li>
            <li> Darnit. I hate to only give 3 stars, because this product is SO GOOD! But it arrived broken. Just not worth the effort to return it.</li>
            <li> Great product! I tried regular deodorant sticks and they were a mess and stained shirts. This stuff is amazing. I highly recommend it for all the sweaty folks out there</li>
            <li> Bought this brand after seeing my previous one (Wind Salt) go up in price by over a dollar since I bought it a year ago.  This brand doesn&#x27;t last for me for more than a few hours (and that&#x27;s not even with significant sweating).  Wind Salt lasted me all day so I may go back.  I used to think all salts would work about the same, but I guess not.</li>
            <li> Seems to work better than the others I&#x27;ve tried. By that, I mean that it actually works for a short period. The others never worked at all. This one works for a little bit. Don&#x27;t expect 12+ hours without any odor. It will reduce it. Great for sensitive pits.</li>
            <li> I started using crystal deodorant sticks nearly 20 years ago and haven&#x27;t looked back. I just got this for my daughter and its wonderful. Ive had some that barely stay in the holder but this one seems very secure. These always last about 2 years so its a huge money save PLUS no chemicals are harmful ingredients going into your body! Wont stop sweat but keeps you from stinking! Recommend this!</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me at all. Not one bit. Other products made by this company are good, but not this stone.</li>
            <li> Does not work. The stick falls out of the plastic and is messy. It leaks crystals all over. I have to set a paper towel down under it. I actually ordered this one by accident. I meant to order a stick. I have never found a crystal stick that works, but my dad seems to like them. However, I found something that works that is aluminum free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for an aluminum free deodorant that actually works, try Meow Meow Tweet&#x27;s Deodorant Cream. They even just came out with a baking soda free version for sensitive skin. The shipping is kinda high off of amazon, so you might want to buy it elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Been using Lafes&#x27; crystal deodorant stick for about 2-3 weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And holy crap. it works!&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I do sweat just a little bit less, but really the biggest thing I have noticed is that I have to be really working/sweating hard to have ANY sweat smell at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deodorant has absolutely NO scent at all.&lt;br /&gt;Its really fairly cheap too... Especially if the guy who recommended it was truthful in how long it lasts, he said that his 1 crystal deodorant lasted about 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So basically if it continues to work like it has been.&lt;br /&gt;It continues to be purchased at about the same price (under $4).&lt;br /&gt;And it lasts anywhere near 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably never buy another type of deodorant ever again.</li>
