            <li>keep finding great prices when I need to reorder!!</li>
            <li>The product itself is excellent.  </li>
            <li>they are very easy to communicate with, pricing is very fair and had a really good experience with them.</li>
            <li>This is a good product and it comes in a timely fashion.  </li>
            <li>Good for what it claims.</li>
            <li>stop making me say more, I have nothing else to add!</li>
            <li>Have had very good results, hair is visabily healther,also have noted a great deal of new growth at this point..</li>
            <li>I am having a amazing results using it and</li>
            <li>and so Im totally satisfied.</li>
            <li>the instructions do say it may take a while...not quite sure yet.</li>
            <li>where they may....:)</li>
            <li>Been using this stuff as more of  a preventative measure.</li>
            <li>Hair feels like it has more texture and easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>i use it along with rogain for women and have seen great results, even in less than a month of use.</li>
            <li>If before after washing hair I had a huge handful of hair to toss, now there is only three to five caught by the hairstopper.</li>
            <li>I am not much of a believer in magic potions.</li>
            <li>Works very well but</li>
            <li>While its hard to be 100% sure, it SEEMS to me that my hair generally feels denser and my thinning spot in back looks more filled in.</li>
            <li>It took a few months to see results, but I&#x27;ve had a lot of new growth and my hair feels thicker for sure.</li>
            <li>Delivery was on time and price was also reasonable, overall I am happy dealing with this vendor, I have used Spectral RS, for almost 2 months, I have not seen much of improvement, but I only use it once a day, not twice as directed, but compared to the length of the time and frequency of using, the increase in the thickness of existing hair has not been that bad, hopefully better results would be achieved as time goes on.</li>
            <li>All I care about is for it to stap falling and grow new ones.</li>
            <li>As to the new ones I think you should start seeng them in three months</li>
            <li>New hairs are growing in and my hair seems to be a bit thicker.  </li>
            <li>and I have noticed new hair growth as well as fuller, healthier hair.</li>
            <li>and I now have new hair growth.</li>
            <li>This product is very expensive but very good.  </li>
            <li>bought it numerous times with consistent retention results.</li>
            <li>or so so it&#x27;s a bit early for that.</li>
            <li>I am 59 and, I think, youthful and buff except for my female pattern hair loss which makes me very upset.</li>
            <li>After using minoxidil for years to combat my receding hair line, I found this natural product, with no harmful side effects.</li>
            <li>Seems like it&#x27;s working so far.  </li>
            <li>in my case this product didn&#x27;t work at all, the hair loss was the same or more, and i bought the 3 products the shampoo, the conditioner and the little spray!</li>
            <li>Man, in just a week I notice that my hair slowed down falling and now by the end of the first bottle it almost stopped falling at all!</li>
            <li>because naturally you have to loose some hair daily, right?</li>
            <li>Used all of this product have not noticed any real improvement as of yet but hoping long term use will have some effect.</li>
            <li>I expected a quicker delivery as I had so much product to use, so I learned that  whien opening the product,nth at is the time to order so this won&#x27;t  happen again.  </li>
            <li>Still not a single sprout!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny to get my hair back after losing half of it from medication side effects.</li>
            <li>This product works very well and other than the price of it, would recommend for anyone with decreasing hair problems.</li>
            <li>Minoxidil came with several warnings and possible side effects, whereas Spectral RS is all natural with no harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised to find new growth in less than 3 months.  </li>
            <li>i like this product a lot because it works and it does not make my limp straight hair greasy!</li>

            <li> the bottle I got on amazon didn&#x27;t last nearly as long compared to the one I purchased at salon.</li>
            <li> Helped retention as long as it was used daily...</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worth trying for at least 4 months to see what results you may get!</li>
            <li> I thought it was normal because I never had any bald or excessive thinning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep buying this product as long as it keeps working its wonders on me and strongly suggest to those desperate ones to give it a try )))</li>
            <li> I did loose hair in the beginning</li>
            <li> I am probably left with just a half of what I used to have.</li>
            <li> When I decided to stop minoxidil, I did expect hairloss, however any loss was minimal.</li>
            <li> I hope it works for other women.</li>
            <li> None the less</li>
            <li> So if before I was even afraid to brush because I would loose tons of hairs, now there is only one or two left on the brush.</li>
            <li> Nothing worked for even for a little bit.</li>
            <li> hairdresser noticed the difference after a few months of use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair a bit stiff, but that can be taken care of by combing your hair after the product has dried.</li>
            <li> When I stop for a while because I run out or am lazy, it reverts to the balding spots.</li>
            <li> Small bald spot is going away.  </li>
            <li> About doubles my hairs usual growth.</li>
            <li> My 3 siblings have thick, curly hair still as did my mother.</li>
            <li> Mine is thin and missing spots.</li>
            <li> I mean &#x27;almost&#x27;</li>
            <li> up and difficult to apply&lt;br /&gt;Lots</li>
            <li> It can get expensive with continued use.</li>
            <li> I was so desperate when I came across this product and decided to try this one too.</li>

            <li> This product just leaves me speechles! I&#x27;ve been loosing hair for years and now in my 30-s I am probably left with just a half of what I used to have. I tried all kinds of vitamins and shampoos, sprays, ampoules etc. I even tried minoxidil of the same brand. Nothing worked for even for a little bit. I was so desperate when I came across this product and decided to try this one too. Man, in just a week I notice that my hair slowed down falling and now by the end of the first bottle it almost stopped falling at all! I mean &#x27;almost&#x27; because naturally you have to loose some hair daily, right? So if before I was even afraid to brush because I would loose tons of hairs, now there is only one or two left on the brush. If before after washing hair I had a huge handful of hair to toss, now there is only three to five caught by the hairstopper. I don&#x27;t care for my hair to grow faster. All I care about is for it to stap falling and grow new ones. As to the new ones I think you should start seeng them in three months or so so it&#x27;s a bit early for that. But I have highest hopes now! I&#x27;ll keep buying this product as long as it keeps working its wonders on me and strongly suggest to those desperate ones to give it a try )))</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never be without this stuff. It works. It took a few months to see results, but I&#x27;ve had a lot of new growth and my hair feels thicker for sure. I&#x27;m a believer.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this products to any woman whose hair is thinning!&lt;br /&gt;My hairdresser noticed the difference after a few months of use.&lt;br /&gt;I keep finding great prices when I need to reorder!!</li>
            <li> they are very easy to communicate with, pricing is very fair and had a really good experience with them. there was a problem regarding shipping but this was resolved without any issues and so Im totally satisfied. can give them 5 stars with out any hazel,  based on my experience.......</li>
            <li> I am 59 and, I think, youthful and buff except for my female pattern hair loss which makes me very upset. My 3 siblings have thick, curly hair still as did my mother. Mine is thin and missing spots. I don&#x27;t know how it works but when I use this product twice daily as instructed, my sparse spots seem to fill in. When I stop for a while because I run out or am lazy, it reverts to the balding spots. I am not much of a believer in magic potions. This stuff just seems to work.</li>
            <li> this product did nothing for my hair loss. Stick with minoxidil which has been tested and approved. This product felt like I was putting water on my head.</li>
            <li> Works very well but the bottle I got on amazon didn&#x27;t last nearly as long compared to the one I purchased at salon.</li>
            <li> Spray bottle did not work well.&lt;br /&gt;Stopped up and difficult to apply&lt;br /&gt;Lots of waste&lt;br /&gt;I will not purchase again</li>
            <li> I have been using this &amp; DSL shampoo &amp; conditioner Revita since August. My hair is the healthiest it has been in as about 20 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it now for about 2 months, and my hair is somewhat thicker. It leaves your hair a bit stiff, but that can be taken care of by combing your hair after the product has dried.</li>
            <li> New hairs are growing in and my hair seems to be a bit thicker.  I&#x27;m using it in combination with the Revita Growth Shampoo and Conditioner Set.</li>
            <li> Still waiting to see if it works ... the instructions do say it may take a while...not quite sure yet.</li>
            <li> Helped retention as long as it was used daily...bought it numerous times with consistent retention results. Am no longer using however and just let things fall where they may....:)</li>
            <li> This product works very well and other than the price of it, would recommend for anyone with decreasing hair problems.</li>
            <li> Used all of this product have not noticed any real improvement as of yet but hoping long term use will have some effect. Been using this stuff as more of  a preventative measure.</li>
            <li> Delivery was on time and price was also reasonable, overall I am happy dealing with this vendor, I have used Spectral RS, for almost 2 months, I have not seen much of improvement, but I only use it once a day, not twice as directed, but compared to the length of the time and frequency of using, the increase in the thickness of existing hair has not been that bad, hopefully better results would be achieved as time goes on.</li>
            <li> After using minoxidil for years to combat my receding hair line, I found this natural product, with no harmful side effects. Minoxidil came with several warnings and possible side effects, whereas Spectral RS is all natural with no harmful chemicals. Once you stop using Minoxidil, I&#x27;m told you will lose the hair it has saved or help regrow. When I decided to stop minoxidil, I did expect hairloss, however any loss was minimal. At that time I started using Spectral RS and applied it as directed. One bottle last about a month, and I just ordered my 4th. If you shop around, you can find it for a fraction of the price of minoxidil. As a result of using Spectral RS, I now have hairs growing in around my temples and the receded areas above my forehead. They are anywhere from 1/2 to 1 inch in length at this time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 1 1/2 years and I have noticed new hair growth as well as fuller, healthier hair.</li>
            <li> This is a good product and it comes in a timely fashion.  I have used this product for over a year and it continues to work as prescribed.</li>
            <li> stop making me say more, I have nothing else to add! I refuse to write a set amount of words.</li>
            <li> While its hard to be 100% sure, it SEEMS to me that my hair generally feels denser and my thinning spot in back looks more filled in. I&#x27;ve been using this along with their shampoo and conditioner for almost a year now. I think it&#x27;s worth trying for at least 4 months to see what results you may get!</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m one of those for whom this product  doesn&#x27;t work. It was delivered in a timely manner. I used it for over two months, having ordered several bottles. Still not a single sprout! I hope it works for other women.</li>
            <li> i like this product a lot. i use it along with rogain for women and have seen great results, even in less than a month of use. i like this product a lot because it works and it does not make my limp straight hair greasy!</li>
            <li> I have used these products for five months. Have had very good results, hair is visabily healther,also have noted a great deal of new growth at this point..hairdresser has also noted this. I would recomend anyone with thinning hair give it a try. It can get expensive with continued use.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised to find new growth in less than 3 months.  I did loose hair in the beginning but I have double that coming in.</li>
            <li> Good for what it claims. Hair feels like it has more texture and easy to manage.  Give it a try.</li>
            <li> Seems like it&#x27;s working so far.  Small bald spot is going away.  I am using it along with Revita shampoo.</li>
            <li> in my case this product didn&#x27;t work at all, the hair loss was the same or more, and i bought the 3 products the shampoo, the conditioner and the little spray!</li>
            <li> About doubles my hairs usual growth. Worth every penny to get my hair back after losing half of it from medication side effects.</li>
            <li> I expected a quicker delivery as I had so much product to use, so I learned that  whien opening the product,nth at is the time to order so this won&#x27;t  happen again.  The product itself is excellent.  I am having a amazing results using it and any interruption in its application can cause a setback.  None the less, It was upsetting to me  at that time at that time to have a delay.</li>
            <li> This product is very expensive but very good.  You use it twice per day but don&#x27;t use a lot of it.</li>
            <li> Throughout my teens and adulthood I have always had a lot of hair loss. I thought it was normal because I never had any bald or excessive thinning. Now in my 30&#x27;s I&#x27;ve noticed some hair thinning. This product has dramatically reduced my hair loss and I now have new hair growth.</li>
