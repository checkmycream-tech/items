            <li>I use it with the Healing Color shampoo and the Tressa Watercolor shampoo to keep my strawberry blond bright and pretty.  </li>
            <li>great for your hair feels soft and does not cause any greasiness.</li>
            <li>SLS FREE</li>
            <li>It also smells spectacular and does not dry out my hair.</li>

            <li>They make my damaged hair look as healthy as virgin hair and silky soft.</li>
            <li>After about two weeks of using this conditioner my hair stopped breaking, and now (after a couple of months) is soft, healthy feeling, and shiny.  </li>
            <li>My hairdresser recommended it and she was right.  </li>
            <li>The product however is amazing and lasts surprisingly long.  </li>
            <li>Very high quality....Will use this vender again!</li>
            <li>I have fine hair with natural curl.</li>
            <li>I think it actually makes my hair easier to style - and - my hair feels really healthy.</li>
            <li>My new favourite conditioner!!  </li>
            <li>I have blonde highlighted hair and this keeps my hair silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>how changing conditioners could have possibly changed my hair SO much, but I certainly won&#x27;t be changing it up any time soon!</li>
            <li>Well worth the extra $$!</li>
            <li>It left my hair super soft and Shiny.</li>
            <li>It has tamed my wild beast that you&#x27;d call Hair!</li>
            <li>Plus, it makes my hair feel so soft without a waxy feel.  </li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and my curls not frizzy.</li>
            <li>This product was recommended by the professional that dyed my hair.  </li>
            <li>After blow drying and styling, it felt a little better, but not much - and the natural shine I have in my hair was dulled.</li>
            <li>Love this creamy thick conditioner!</li>
            <li>but generally I like Lanza products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The combination of the shampoo and ESPECIALLY the conditioner keep my hair soft, shiny, manageable, and enviable.  </li>
            <li>I live in an extremely dry climate and my (bleached out) hair had the consistancy of hay.  </li>
            <li>If you have fine or thin hair, this product is not for you - stay away from it and find something else...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Absolutely in love with this conditioner!</li>
            <li> My nail technition (of all people!) recommended Healing Color Care Shampoo and Condition to me after she noticed how brittle my highlights were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has been using it for years, and I just assumed she had great hair to start with.  Lo and Behold, her great hair is the result of great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The combination of the shampoo and ESPECIALLY the conditioner keep my hair soft, shiny, manageable, and enviable.  And my color lasts forever.  If I could get the gray to stop growing, I would rarely even have to have it colored!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have one suggestion.  After I wash my hair, I put in the Color Care Conditioner and keep it in until I am done with the rest of my shower.  Then I rinse it out.  I get the best results that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it.  You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  My hairdresser recommended it and she was right.  It has tamed my wild beast that you&#x27;d call Hair!</li>
            <li> This is  a great product for my fine, curly hair</li>
            <li> First of all this product has the most wonderful smell.  Plus, it makes my hair feel so soft without a waxy feel.  I think it actually makes my hair easier to style - and - my hair feels really healthy.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;anza line... Wow. I&#x27;ve been searching for the best hair products for my fine, damaged hair. I cannot use drug store products because they strip my color and dry out my hair/scalp. L&#x27;anza products are spectacular. They make my damaged hair look as healthy as virgin hair and silky soft. It also smells spectacular and does not dry out my hair. Absolutely love this line</li>
            <li> Lanza is the best shampoo/conditioner out there, and I am a beauty junkie!  I gave this 4 stars rather than 5 because the bottle came opened and some of the conditioner leaked out.  That I was not pleased with.  The product however is amazing and lasts surprisingly long.  I have blonde highlighted hair and this keeps my hair silky smooth.  Well worth the extra $$!</li>
            <li> I live in an extremely dry climate and my (bleached out) hair had the consistancy of hay.  It was brittle, breaking, and so dry it felt crunchy.

After about two weeks of using this conditioner my hair stopped breaking, and now (after a couple of months) is soft, healthy feeling, and shiny.  The difference is so extreme, I can hardly believe it.  I don&#x27;t even recognize my hair.  I have no idea how changing conditioners could have possibly changed my hair SO much, but I certainly won&#x27;t be changing it up any time soon!</li>
            <li> Loved this shampoo and conditioner from Lanza. It left my hair super soft and Shiny. I recently dyed my hair red and the color has lasted a long time. It smells good too!! As of now this is the best shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve tried for my hair!! 5/5</li>
            <li> My new favourite conditioner!!  Makes my hair soft and my curls not frizzy.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by the professional that dyed my hair.  It definitely preserves the color and helps the hair to heal from damage at the same time.</li>
            <li> Light-weight, nourishing conditioner that doesn&#x27;t strip color.  I love this stuff.  I&#x27;m sensitive to artificial fragrances, but this stuff doesn&#x27;t bother me.  I use it with the Healing Color shampoo and the Tressa Watercolor shampoo to keep my strawberry blond bright and pretty.  Works great!</li>
            <li> Love this creamy thick conditioner!</li>
            <li> great for your hair feels soft and does not cause any greasiness. you can use it everyday  love it a lot.</li>
            <li> Very high quality....Will use this vender again!</li>
            <li> Have just started using this product but generally I like Lanza products. I like the fact that this is. SLS FREE</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended this after I got hi-lights and I&#x27;ve been using it since, my color lasts and my hair looks nice and shiny after using.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner! it leaves my hair super soft and it smells great!</li>
            <li> Helps keep hair Fromm fading</li>
            <li> I have fine hair with natural curl. I color my hair monthly and have been for over 20 years. I&#x27;m going on vacation soon to sunny Florida and wanted something to help protect my hair color from fading since I&#x27;ll be outside quite a bit. I thought this product would be perfect, and all the great reviews convinced me to try it. Boy, was that a bad decision! I used both the shampoo and conditioner, and by the time I got out of the shower my hair felt just like straw (and yes, I left it in for around 10 minutes while I showered). After blow drying and styling, it felt a little better, but not much - and the natural shine I have in my hair was dulled. I used it once and will now have to throw it away because the vendor I purchased from does not accept returns of used products. If you have fine or thin hair, this product is not for you - stay away from it and find something else... you&#x27;ve been warned.</li>
