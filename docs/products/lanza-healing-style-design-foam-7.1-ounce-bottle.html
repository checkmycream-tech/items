            <li>Works great, and leaves hair looking natural .</li>
            <li>I live in a high humidity area but Beach Hair products are awesome!!!</li>
            <li>Was very happy to find this &amp; it was priced almost $2 less than what I&#x27;ve been paying!</li>
            <li>this product is better than Big and Sexy!</li>
            <li>I love the whole Lanza line of hair products!</li>
            <li>This mousse really helps create volume in my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Great product that isn&#x27;t too heavy.</li>
            <li>This will not weigh your hair down and for blonde hair, it&#x27;s a perfect styling product.</li>
            <li>My hair looks great and has body without even blow drying which is what usually gives the body.</li>
            <li>and it went back to the nice curly look right away without having to play with it too much.</li>
            <li>so I may have used a little too much; it still looks great though.</li>
            <li>Have used this product for years with great results, but the last one I received was different.  </li>
            <li>If I use it with a round brush while drying my hair I get great lift that lasts much of the day.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different styling foams and I always return to the Lanza Foam.</li>
            <li>You cannot use too much and its styling ability is great, even with other treatments such a Moroccan oil.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more soon + other products from here!</li>
            <li>I know it is a little more pricey than some, but it is well worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>I have fine limp and straight hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if you do not want fine limp hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that I don&#x27;t have to use as much as some of the lighter foams, so I think I&#x27;m actually saving money!!</li>
            <li>Makes your hair sooooo soft.</li>
            <li>After using Nioxin foam for years with their new ingredients it wasn&#x27;t the same.</li>
            <li>The contents is great but the lever (pump) is EXTREMLY difficult to push down.</li>
            <li>Lanza Urban Elements is a must for girls with fine or thin hair.</li>

            <li> Great product and cheaper than at my salon.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and seller</li>
            <li> Lanza Urban Elements is a must for girls with fine or thin hair. You cannot use too much and its styling ability is great, even with other treatments such a Moroccan oil. This will not weigh your hair down and for blonde hair, it&#x27;s a perfect styling product. For the gentleman, this product will work for styling short hair without the heaviness of wax or gel.</li>
            <li> This is the best styling mouse I have ever used.  Will buy again and I use it sparingly so I will have it on special occasions when I want my hair to look really good.  I would buy from this seller again without question.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years with great results, but the last one I received was different.  I don&#x27;t know if they changed the formula or I got a knock off, but my hair felt stiff and not as manageable.</li>
            <li> The contents is great but the lever (pump) is EXTREMLY difficult to push down. So how should I rate this item?</li>
            <li> This mousse really helps create volume in my fine hair.  If I use it with a round brush while drying my hair I get great lift that lasts much of the day.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different styling foams and I always return to the Lanza Foam. My hair is fine and it is difficult to hold in the body when styling it. It is not too heavy and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel sticky, as some of the others do. I know it is a little more pricey than some, but it is well worth the extra money. I&#x27;ve found that I don&#x27;t have to use as much as some of the lighter foams, so I think I&#x27;m actually saving money!!</li>
            <li> 100% satisfied.  Arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> Awesome light foam that gives your hair body, style but soft, with a great fragrance</li>
            <li> Love this product!  This is the only way I can get it!  Through Amazon, so hope I can continue to do so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years buying from my hairdresser, but she recently retired. Was very happy to find this &amp; it was priced almost $2 less than what I&#x27;ve been paying! Will be ordering more soon + other products from here!</li>
            <li> I have fine limp and straight hair. this product is better than Big and Sexy! I live in a high humidity area but Beach Hair products are awesome!!! I highly recommend this product if you do not want fine limp hair.</li>
            <li> After using Nioxin foam for years with their new ingredients it wasn&#x27;t the same. Lanza foam gives body but does not leave hair stiff.It works for me.</li>
            <li> I have fine curly hair and love, love, love this styling mouse! As other reviews have said, it gives body and doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down. Not much at all needs used. My hair looks great and has body without even blow drying which is what usually gives the body. I brushed though it and it went back to the nice curly look right away without having to play with it too much. It has a glossy look so I may have used a little too much; it still looks great though.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair sooooo soft.</li>
            <li> I love the whole Lanza line of hair products!</li>
            <li> Works great, and leaves hair looking natural . Not at all drying.</li>
            <li> great holds hair in place!</li>
            <li> Great product that isn&#x27;t too heavy. It adds lift and volume without making my hair look oily or so lifted that it looks out of control.</li>
