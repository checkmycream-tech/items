    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is the best lace glue for me.</li>
            <li>Excellent adhesive,but it must be used in accordance with the instructions.</li>
            <li>Good luck!</li>
            <li>This product is excellent, and it hold AMAZINGLY!</li>
            <li>As a hair stylist I find this product to be great for beginners.</li>
            <li>Prices is great.</li>
            <li>A lot cheaper and great hold for two months now</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>This is the best adhesive I have used for a skin type hair piece it doesn&#x27;t run when sweating and I sweat profusely and remains adhered through many activities..</li>
            <li>It gives a good 1 week hold give or take.  </li>
            <li>GOOD PRICE WILL ORDER AGAIN WHEN NEEDED...</li>
            <li>Not as good as</li>
            <li>Good, good stuff.  </li>
            <li>The best glue for full lace wig</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the applicator in this size bottle...</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Walker&#x27;s Ultra Hold Adhesive!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a Amazing.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about a year now and now that I have worked out my own process, I won&#x27;t use anything else.  </li>
            <li>Try to be light with the Ultra Hold also because the more you use the more you have to remove and the best way to clean it off is using the mirror slide technique and instead of that C-22 just use Goo Gone!</li>
            <li>I am not a licensed professional and have used this product very successfully.  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent product for Lacefronts or regular wigs.</li>
            <li>i bought it i dnt use the glues that most of my clients wear.so</li>
            <li>I simply love this product and it works great, i&#x27;ve been buying this product for a while, and love the price,my order came fast</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Like the regular one the Best</li>
            <li>Been using this product for years , I am a hair designer and this is a top rate product for holding on hair pieces .</li>
            <li>I love the walker ultra adhesive. .</li>
            <li>I Love it.  </li>
            <li>I had to spend more time to remove the hair.</li>
            <li>It holds better than 30 seconds lace glue</li>
            <li>I have found that the thinner coating you use the better.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Will be ordering more of this soon.</li>
            <li>This should hold better</li>
            <li>In hot and humid weather, this product still works well, even after jogging 8 miles which is surprising.</li>
            <li>I have not tried any other glues but have heard excellent reviews on Ghost Bond.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s perfect because I need to wash my own hair at least that often.  </li>
            <li>It holds your lace front or full lace wigs in place, the hold can lass up to a week or more.</li>
            <li>there is a learning curve to this adhesive , but if you are willing to stick with it, it holds up nicely</li>
            <li>If you want a secure fit and hold this is the product for you.</li>
            <li>but it matters as far as it goes with getting a good bond.</li>
            <li>The whole process of taking off the wig, cleaning it, washing it, washing my own hair, braiding my hair and re-applying the clean wig takes me about 4 hours.  </li>
            <li>, i used a blow dryer at times on cool its just gooey</li>
            <li>i could have sewn in 3 full head weaves in that amount of time and</li>
            <li>It took me hours to apply and I used a blow dryer on cool to peed up the drying process.</li>
            <li>Great for a super hold..even when your hair gets wet.</li>
            <li>I would advise you wear a cap or scarf when working out or very hot weather.</li>
            <li>Fantastic hold for days - sure it would last for weeks</li>
            <li>My head was more sensitive to the adhesive and broke out on my nape.</li>
            <li>I had to buy my own set of brushes (smaller).  </li>
            <li>sure I kept the outer rim as clean as possible.  </li>
            <li>For me a week is just right.</li>
            <li>and it just comes right off.  </li>
            <li>To do it right you must take your time.</li>
            <li>Must be sure to allow drying time (about 10 minutes)before second application and then again before affixing your unit.</li>
            <li>I also, recommend that first time users have your stylist apply the Ultra Hold product.</li>
            <li>Then once that is done apply the unit properly (making sure your head and perimeter have been cleaned with alcohol.)  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You can also try using a \\&quot;wooden stick\\&quot; like those used to apply wax this works better than a brush.</li>
            <li>I love this glue, but for health concerns I am going to try another type, and I suggest others do the same.</li>
            <li>Make sure you read the label and follow the instructions, when in doubt, contact your local beauty Salon to avoid hair loss or irritations.</li>
            <li>will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>you get exactly what it says ultra hold regardless of the weather.</li>
            <li>First of all it is so gooey.</li>
            <li>I consistently get a 2 week hold with this product alone.  </li>
            <li>I tried the tape, but it only caused me more aggrivation and no added benefits.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I am giving it 1 star more than I feel I should is because it is as descibed.</li>
            <li>Good product just needs smaller brushes for smaller sections</li>
            <li>, I just don&#x27;t wear it that long.:)</li>
            <li>Good Glue but sticky messy get all over ur face and hair and Hans!</li>
            <li>Also to cut down on shine use some of your own face powder around the perimeter.</li>
            <li>This adhesive.is very high quality.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>I wear them around 3 to 4 weeks straight with touch ups here and there.</li>
            <li>The thing about the whole lace wig process is you cannot do it if you are in a hurry.  </li>
            <li>(The reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it yellows and thickens before I can ever use the whole bottle)</li>
            <li>thank for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This glue doesn&#x27;t hold very well at all...</li>
            <li>I only need temporary holding power for short durations ... usually one day ... and this product is perfect for that.  </li>
            <li>very ultra hold Adhesive, strong, a bit of small but not much at all, does the job properly and Iam happy</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have as much as a high shine around the perimeter.</li>
            <li>I love Ultra Hold despite it being sticky and messy.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you let the Ultra Hold dry until you can touch it without getting any strings coming back at you.</li>
            <li>And for all of the new hair styles today the adhesive works well on weaves, wigs, etc.</li>
            <li>and I live in the South (Memphis,TN)</li>
            <li>Good product, can be a little messy if you use too much, but it does the job.</li>
            <li>5 hrs last nite 2 this morning to be exact.</li>
            <li>So far this glue has been a nightmare!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve spent that long or longer in a salon!!</li>
            <li>im a professional cosmetologist but have sensitive skin which is y</li>
            <li>direct bd get the newest formula Ghost Bond XL.</li>
            <li>I wash my full lace wigs with them on in the shower and I condition them too with slight lifting(mostly in the nape) while still attached to my head.</li>
            <li>but I wear my full lace year round</li>
            <li>I buy my own smaller brushes to apply it with to cut down on the mess.  </li>
            <li>There is no other product like it..</li>
            <li>One layer, let it dry for 10 minutes, apply another layer, let it dry for 5 minutes and ready.</li>
            <li>this glue doesnt dry clear its gooey.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would not suggest anyone to purchase a large quantity for yourself because the glue residue around the rim of bottle becomes quite messy.</li>

            <li> I was worried at ordering this large amount because I use only a little and thought it may dry out or yellow.  </li>
            <li> Buy the large  for home and a small for travel.</li>
            <li> When you take the brush out of the bottle a long string of glue follows the brush to your hairline.</li>
            <li> the small bottles I was used to have a much smaller and more difficult brush to use.  </li>
            <li> The product works as it&#x27;s supose to but it took a very long time to come and for over a week the system was saying that it hadn&#x27;t even shipped yet</li>
            <li> BUT you must allow it to dry to the \\&quot;tacky\\&quot; stage, which is around 5-9 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Then once this is done apply another coat and let it dry another 5 minutes or tacky...</li>
            <li> then it took hours to dry</li>
            <li> Once I did it in 2 hours (using a blow dryer to dry the wig).  </li>
            <li> By the way once the glue dried it only last me two days before I had to reapply.</li>
            <li> I have tried other lace glue and it didn&#x27;t stay as long as Ultra hold.</li>
            <li> 30 sec glue takes longer to eat up.</li>
            <li> I had to be careful how I handled the bottle making</li>
            <li> It holds the same and it&#x27;s much less messy at cleaning time.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t use one of these products without using the other two.</li>
            <li> Press your wig down and don&#x27;t get the glue wet for 24 hours.</li>
            <li> It sucks big  time.</li>
            <li> Yes I know this is hard because it takes a few minutes</li>
            <li> However, the drying process takes at least 5-10 mins in order to get a firm hold for lace front wigs.</li>
            <li> its really thick and messy while trying to apply it the globs leaked on my arms and my hair all over.</li>
            <li> It smells terrible and is probably a bit toxic, but it still works better than anything else on the market.</li>
            <li> LACE SYSTEMS ARENT SUPPOSED TO BE THIS DIFFICULT OR TAKE THAT LONG.</li>
            <li> It was horrible not to mention the box the glue came in was full of glue</li>
            <li> But I was not happy with it.</li>
            <li> it does hold but messy!!!!</li>

            <li> I have used this product on myself and my clients.  This product does work.  BUT you must allow it to dry to the \\&quot;tacky\\&quot; stage, which is around 5-9 minutes.  Then once this is done apply another coat and let it dry another 5 minutes or tacky... Then once that is done apply the unit properly (making sure your head and perimeter have been cleaned with alcohol.)  If you follow these steps this will work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also try using a \\&quot;wooden stick\\&quot; like those used to apply wax this works better than a brush. Good luck! Also to cut down on shine use some of your own face powder around the perimeter.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for Lacefronts or regular wigs. If you want a secure fit and hold this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> because it works. Fantastic hold for days - sure it would last for weeks, I just don&#x27;t wear it that long.:)</li>
            <li> This product is excellent, and it hold AMAZINGLY! But this lace front glue contains \\&quot;Tolulene\\&quot; which is known to cause a lot of health problems. I love this glue, but for health concerns I am going to try another type, and I suggest others do the same.</li>
            <li> Ultra hold does just what it says! It holds your lace front or full lace wigs in place, the hold can lass up to a week or more. For me a week is just right. The thing about the Walker Ultra Hold Adhesive is that not only does it works, but it works will with the Walkers Scalp Protector and Walker C-22 Citrus Solvent. You can&#x27;t use one of these products without using the other two. Make sure you read the label and follow the instructions, when in doubt, contact your local beauty Salon to avoid hair loss or irritations.</li>
            <li> this glue had me messing in my hair for several hours. 5 hrs last nite 2 this morning to be exact. this glue doesnt dry clear its gooey. its really thick and messy while trying to apply it the globs leaked on my arms and my hair all over. then it took hours to dry, it wont stay put. the lace system moved up into my hairline and i had to keep fixing it, i used a blow dryer at times on cool its just gooey and i dont recommend it. now i have to buy a different glue and the goo collects any and everything it comes in contact with. my hair line after about 8 hrs had all kinda stuff i used tweezers to pick it off hence the seven hrs. im a professional cosmetologist but have sensitive skin which is y i bought it i dnt use the glues that most of my clients wear.so i know it wasnt because i didnt know what i was doing. It sucks big  time. PASS ON THIS PRODUCT!!!! LACE SYSTEMS ARENT SUPPOSED TO BE THIS DIFFICULT OR TAKE THAT LONG. i could have sewn in 3 full head weaves in that amount of time and then sum.[[ASIN:B001B4A4JG Ultra Hold Acrylic Adhesive 3.4 oz]]</li>
            <li> I simply love this product and it works great, i&#x27;ve been buying this product for a while, and love the price,my order came fast</li>
            <li> I love it. longest hold time ever!</li>
            <li> GOOD PRICE WILL ORDER AGAIN WHEN NEEDED...DOROTHY PARKER</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Walker&#x27;s Ultra Hold Adhesive!</li>
            <li> This is the best adhesive I have used for a skin type hair piece it doesn&#x27;t run when sweating and I sweat profusely and remains adhered through many activities..</li>
            <li> Good Glue but sticky messy get all over ur face and hair and Hans! beware! it does hold but messy!!!!</li>
            <li> very ultra hold Adhesive, strong, a bit of small but not much at all, does the job properly and Iam happy</li>
            <li> Great for a super hold..even when your hair gets wet. And for all of the new hair styles today the adhesive works well on weaves, wigs, etc.</li>
            <li> No. It holds but not like it say it will, reglue every week. Like the regular one the Best</li>
            <li> there is a learning curve to this adhesive , but if you are willing to stick with it, it holds up nicely</li>
            <li> Not as good as 30 sec glue takes longer to eat up. My head was more sensitive to the adhesive and broke out on my nape.</li>
            <li> Love this product! will definitely buy more. In hot and humid weather, this product still works well, even after jogging 8 miles which is surprising. Prices is great.</li>
            <li> This is e only adhesive I will buy for my wigs. Lasts for days and even when I&#x27;m swimming or in the shower</li>
            <li> Purchased because this is what is used at hair club.  A lot cheaper and great hold for two months now.. washed hair and it is still holding!</li>
            <li> Been using this item for just over 2 months now.  Works well. I only need temporary holding power for short durations ... usually one day ... and this product is perfect for that.  I was worried at ordering this large amount because I use only a little and thought it may dry out or yellow.  It doesn&#x27;t.  Very pleased with the applicator in this size bottle...the small bottles I was used to have a much smaller and more difficult brush to use.  I will be \\&quot;sticking\\&quot; to this size and this product from now on.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years , I am a hair designer and this is a top rate product for holding on hair pieces .</li>
            <li> The best glue for full lace wig</li>
            <li> I love the walker ultra adhesive. . There is no other product like it.. you get exactly what it says ultra hold regardless of the weather. It holds up to its name.. I Love it.  The plus is I have even went swimming and had ultra hold...it&#x27;s a Amazing.</li>
            <li> I had all kinds of problems with this glue! First of all it is so gooey. When you take the brush out of the bottle a long string of glue follows the brush to your hairline. As you are trying to get it out of your hair it gets sticky and all over your fingers. If it dries outside of your lace front like around the edges then it&#x27;s shiny. I&#x27;m very dissapointed. It took me hours to apply and I used a blow dryer on cool to peed up the drying process. I have not tried any other glues but have heard excellent reviews on Ghost Bond. I ordered it and am waiting to try it. If you order Ghost Bond go to hair direct bd get the newest formula Ghost Bond XL. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m not applying it correctly or what but I do have a license and it still took me hours! After I applied it I tied a scarf around my hair line and went to bed. Yes some of the hair was stuck to my face when I one up. I had to spend more time to remove the hair. I used 91% alcohol and found it to do a grat job it&#x27;s not oily like c-22. I hope my review was helpful. By the way once the glue dried it only last me two days before I had to reapply. Also I work out and after I sweated my entire hairline was lifting. I would advise you wear a cap or scarf when working out or very hot weather. So far this glue has been a nightmare! Every tool I used to help apply this unit has glue on it! I now need to remove the sticky glue from my combs, clips etc before I can use them. Buyers beware!</li>
            <li> This is the best lace glue for me. It holds better than 30 seconds lace glue and it is not as sticky and gummy. It doesn&#x27;t have as much as a high shine around the perimeter. The only thing I would not suggest anyone to purchase a large quantity for yourself because the glue residue around the rim of bottle becomes quite messy.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. I love Ultra Hold despite it being sticky and messy. I&#x27;ve been using it for years but now I&#x27;m adding in EnduraBond to see if I get a longer hold. I have very oily skin and I live in the South (Memphis,TN) but I will use this along with red tape to make a barrier betweeen my lace and the EnduraBond which can tear your lace.Order:Skin protector, EnduraBond, Red Tape, and then Ultra Hold. Sounds like alot but I wear my full lace year round and I don&#x27;t have time to constantly fool with it lol. Just make sure you let the Ultra Hold dry until you can touch it without getting any strings coming back at you. Yes I know this is hard because it takes a few minutes but it matters as far as it goes with getting a good bond. Press your wig down and don&#x27;t get the glue wet for 24 hours. I wash my full lace wigs with them on in the shower and I condition them too with slight lifting(mostly in the nape) while still attached to my head. I wear them around 3 to 4 weeks straight with touch ups here and there. Try to be light with the Ultra Hold also because the more you use the more you have to remove and the best way to clean it off is using the mirror slide technique and instead of that C-22 just use Goo Gone! Way cheaper same effects. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> It smells terrible and is probably a bit toxic, but it still works better than anything else on the market.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a year now and now that I have worked out my own process, I won&#x27;t use anything else.  It did take a minute to get used to using the product.  I had to buy my own set of brushes (smaller).  I had to be careful how I handled the bottle making sure I kept the outer rim as clean as possible.  I consistently get a 2 week hold with this product alone.  That&#x27;s perfect because I need to wash my own hair at least that often.  I have found that the thinner coating you use the better.  It holds the same and it&#x27;s much less messy at cleaning time.  I tried the tape, but it only caused me more aggrivation and no added benefits.  To remove the glue I use a combination of C-22 and Alcohol.  I spray C-22, wait about 5-10 minutes and spray alcohol and wait, I do this about 3 times then take a used dryer sheet to take the glue off the wig and it just comes right off.  The thing about the whole lace wig process is you cannot do it if you are in a hurry.  To do it right you must take your time. I am not a licensed professional and have used this product very successfully.  The whole process of taking off the wig, cleaning it, washing it, washing my own hair, braiding my hair and re-applying the clean wig takes me about 4 hours.  Once I did it in 2 hours (using a blow dryer to dry the wig).  Can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve spent that long or longer in a salon!! (The reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it yellows and thickens before I can ever use the whole bottle)</li>
            <li> Too sticky. And it hold like I thought it would. I read the reviews that&#x27;s the  only reason why I purchased it. But I was not happy with it.</li>
            <li> This adhesive.is very high quality.  I still can&#x27;t believe how well it holds.</li>
            <li> Excellent adhesive,but it must be used in accordance with the instructions. One layer, let it dry for 10 minutes, apply another layer, let it dry for 5 minutes and ready.</li>
            <li> Bottle is larger than I imagined, smaller bottle would have worked.  Product&lt;br /&gt;works as stated and I have no problems recommending product and seller.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Good, good stuff.  In fact it hold too well.  You will need to purchase a solvent for this product.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Have been using it for years.  Buy the large  for home and a small for travel.</li>
            <li> The product works as it&#x27;s supose to but it took a very long time to come and for over a week the system was saying that it hadn&#x27;t even shipped yet so I didn&#x27;t know what was going on. The only reason I am giving it 1 star more than I feel I should is because it is as descibed.</li>
            <li> I have tried other lace glue and it didn&#x27;t stay as long as Ultra hold. Will be ordering more of this soon. thank for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It was horrible not to mention the box the glue came in was full of glue</li>
            <li> This glue doesn&#x27;t hold very well at all...I will never order this product again.</li>
            <li> Santa has been using spirit gum remover for the beard. This should hold better</li>
