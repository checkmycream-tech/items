            <li>Another awesome e.l.f product!</li>
            <li>I am very happy I switched because this product lasts all day and the color is perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>However, the color Ash works perfectly for me.  </li>
            <li>This is awesome.</li>
            <li>Color is perfect for me</li>
            <li>This is the greatest stuff ever!  </li>
            <li>This product is very good.</li>
            <li>Good luck!</li>
            <li>This is a great product to fill in the gaps and create a shape.</li>
            <li>you can get a color match, great.</li>
            <li>So easy to apply, worked great!</li>
            <li>my eyebrows grew and I wanted something light and let me tell you this is perfect</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what it takes to find a good eyebrow shadow, but I&#x27;ve never found one</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a good match for me.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product for the price.</li>
            <li>this does a good job.</li>
            <li>This is pretty damn good :D</li>
            <li>This is a great product and a good color for my light brown hair.</li>
            <li>After using the Light kit for a couple days, I switched to the Ash, and YAYYYYYYY I found something that matches!!</li>
            <li>I Love it !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read a lot of rave reviews, and shannxo, one of my favorite youtubers, always uses this eyebrow kit, and her brows look amazing!</li>
            <li>Use your own.  </li>
            <li>I must have misread, but this is creamy, not the powder kind.</li>
            <li>The pigmented gel that you use first looks too light, but the setting powder brings out the color perfectly.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job and not nearly as expensive as others I have used.</li>
            <li>I like the combo of the very lightly colored wax and the very lightly colored brow color powder.</li>
            <li>I have seen this product used in many YouTube videos</li>
            <li>I love that it has gel and the powder sets the gel.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>got this for daughter she loves doing her eyebrows and this is a kit she loves and love the price love e.l.f. products..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more of a pencil kinda girl, but this does help fill in anything that the pencil for some reason can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>i love this brow kit.</li>
            <li>If you need a great product for your eyebrows with really fast shipping ..</li>
            <li>I love this dual eyebrow kit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a problem because I don&#x27;t touch my eyebrows after I do them, but if I do it can come off easily.</li>
            <li>Provides what I needed to successfully fill in brows and create a natural look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always tweaking them slightly trying to find the perfect method, hence why I tried this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great way to fill in some bare spots on the eyebrows, esp in this color, good for light colored hair, doesn&#x27;t look penciled in, looks natural.</li>
            <li>You have the gel to smooth and shape those unruly hairs and a setting powder to lock in the sultry look you&#x27;ve just created.</li>
            <li>I bought the kit in Ash, and Light.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t really the best when it comes to staying on for a long time.</li>
            <li>Love the color, great for someone who&#x27;s eyebrows are blond, and has darker hair - very natural looking, and no harsh lines like you get with a pencil.</li>
            <li>She is a natural light blonde and it matches perfectly.</li>
            <li>so thankfully I have a full size brow brush I used instead.</li>
            <li>I think the hue should be more cool, and less warm.  </li>
            <li>but at home I use my own angle brush from the Coastal Scents 22 Piece Brush Set I purchased recently (</li>
            <li>or even going over the pencil when its not the right color.</li>
            <li>I have used it many times already and have barely made a dent in it.</li>
            <li>This e.l.f. eyebrow kit is a great value and provides enough product to last quite a while.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t absolutely love is the brush that it comes with.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my sister and she has eyebrows now for the first time in her life.</li>
            <li>Brows are pretty much my favorite part of my routine, because I really think they totally change the way your face looks!</li>
            <li>I just think there are too many skin tones out there for this few of options(This should be available for anybody).</li>
            <li>The blonde color itself is great; I usually have a problem with blonde shades being too yellow or ruddy, but this is a great taupey/ash blonde.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cream side is the more useful of the two, but it looks odd.  </li>
            <li>Its very crayon like.</li>
            <li>The powder side does absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li>And no one wants that.</li>
            <li>I am a light almost platinum blonde and this color worked for me.</li>
            <li>Surprised how much i like it actually since it was so inexpensive :)</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work very well for me.  </li>
            <li>really like the gel, and will probably use it</li>
            <li>just is much.</li>
            <li>I found it was extremely unforgiving, the brush is much too short to get a good grip on</li>
            <li>This eyebrow kit is very natural looking, the exact look I want.  </li>
            <li>i am a natural blonde, so i kind of think that the &amp;#34;ash&amp;#34; color is a little too light.  </li>
            <li>This eye makeup is quite cheap and it turned out to be a much lighter shade of brown than I expected.</li>
            <li>I will deffinitley purchase when out in the future, but I&#x27;m sure it will last me a while.</li>
            <li>I found the pigmentation to not be as strong as I expected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so hard to find a good one when ur a platinum/ash blonde</li>
            <li>I have light / medium brown hair and this is the only product that isn&#x27;t too red for me.</li>
            <li>Only reason one star is taken off is because there were only 2 color options available when I purchased.</li>
            <li>What really broke this product for me is the powder; its SO chalky and flaky, and I really have to dig with the brush to get out enough for the color to show up.</li>
            <li>It lasts all day and looks very natural.</li>
            <li>This product is one of ELF&#x27;s higher raved about items and generally well-recommended among brow products in general</li>
            <li>These last forever and is actually a true ash blonde color!</li>
            <li>it makes my eyes rows look natural.</li>
            <li>Before trying this product I was using a brow pencil by Mary Kay in Classic Blonde.  </li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and have dirty blonde hair with very light eyebrows, so finding a shade that matched my color was not easy.  </li>
            <li>It took me a little while to get the hang of gel with the brush (its sooo tiny, I got a bigger one), but I&#x27;m in love now.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes on this one because of some of the stellar reviews, but this was a waste of money for me.  </li>
            <li>this color barely showed up on my face, so i think that i would have gone with a darker color if i could have returned this kit.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I skip the powder because it makes them darker and more dramatic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better to go without and go natural, then have the wrong colour on.  </li>
            <li>I only paid a few dollars, but it was more wasted money on something I&#x27;ll never use.</li>

            <li> I only paid a few dollars, but it was more wasted money on something I&#x27;ll never use.</li>
            <li> my eyebrows are completely white/yellow blonde, so i wanted them to look a little more dramatic than the &amp;#34;ash&amp;#34; could provide.  </li>
            <li> I have ash blonde hair and my eyebrows are apparently lighter than any other manufacturer believes eyebrows can be.</li>
            <li> I have used many brow products but all have produced an artificial look.  </li>
            <li> It is applied smoothly to your eyebrows and doesn&#x27;t leave that drawn on fake look .</li>
            <li> At least on me, I like the color (I am somewhat blond girl), and like the fact that I need to use powdery stuff to make it look natural overall.</li>
            <li> Maybe it wasn&#x27;t dark enough for my brows?</li>
            <li> I have a really hard time finding shades that match my natural.</li>
            <li> I have very blonde, thin, and barely visible eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> and I only need a small amount to cover.  </li>
            <li> For me, being dark haired, it did not work.</li>
            <li> Have gone from expensive to very affordable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried some other brands and I felt like when you looked at my face all you could see was BROWS!</li>
            <li> product isn&#x27;t awful by any means, but it&#x27;s not as amazing as I hoped.</li>
            <li> But I was super disappointed.</li>
            <li> the teeny, weeny, little brush is so small to use... that you should probably buy 2 brushes to use this kit.  </li>
            <li> not sure, but didn&#x27;t fill in as well as I hoped.</li>
            <li> It works as well, if not better than a S--box product that sells for 10x the price.  </li>
            <li> they all are kinda a weird darker blonde color.</li>
            <li> It seems silly to buy this product just for the gel side, so I will probably use this up, then go back to my Anastasia powder duo + NYX wax pencil.</li>
            <li> The wax was even worse, it was almost like it was mostly dried out and it made my brush harden with the gunk.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t add colour, but is supposed to set the cream, but for me there&#x27;s no point setting something that is wrong to begin with.  </li>
            <li> Feels uncomfortable on my skin, even though it&#x27;s just on the eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Also, throw away the brush that comes with it, or you will end up with tons of hairs in the product, which are impossible to get out.</li>
            <li> Plus, the brush provided is terrible.  </li>
            <li> but brush is terrible.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I went through a bleach blonde phase and this was just about the only brow filler that didn&#x27;t make me look like groucho marx! Another awesome e.l.f product!</li>
            <li> This is pretty damn good :D my eyebrows grew and I wanted something light and let me tell you this is perfect it makes my eyes rows look natural. If you don&#x27;t eyebrow hair I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them.</li>
            <li> Its very crayon like. Waxy. I would have been happier I think if it was darker. Going to try another brand.</li>
            <li> I have seen this product used in many YouTube videos so I thought I would give it a try.  Before trying this product I was using a brow pencil by Mary Kay in Classic Blonde.  I am very happy I switched because this product lasts all day and the color is perfect for me.  I am fair skinned and have dirty blonde hair with very light eyebrows, so finding a shade that matched my color was not easy.  However, the color Ash works perfectly for me.  I love that it has gel and the powder sets the gel. The only thing I don&#x27;t absolutely love is the brush that it comes with.  For on-the-go it&#x27;s ok but at home I use my own angle brush from the Coastal Scents 22 Piece Brush Set I purchased recently ([[ASIN:B005UBN5AQ Coastal Scents Piece Brush Set]]</li>
            <li> I have very blonde, thin, and barely visible eyebrows.  I have used many brow products but all have produced an artificial look.  This eyebrow kit is very natural looking, the exact look I want.  It does not cake or fade and I only need a small amount to cover.  It last all day and does not need to be reapplied.  It does a great job and not nearly as expensive as others I have used. I will continue to use this kit in the future.</li>
            <li> got this for daughter she loves doing her eyebrows and this is a kit she loves and love the price love e.l.f. products..</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. This eye makeup is quite cheap and it turned out to be a much lighter shade of brown than I expected. For me, being dark haired, it did not work.</li>
            <li> I have light / medium brown hair and this is the only product that isn&#x27;t too red for me. LOVVVVE IT!</li>
            <li> This is a great product and a good color for my light brown hair. It isn&#x27;t really the best when it comes to staying on for a long time. I&#x27;ve never had a problem because I don&#x27;t touch my eyebrows after I do them, but if I do it can come off easily. But I get compliments all the time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it takes to find a good eyebrow shadow, but I&#x27;ve never found one that&#x27;s a good match for me.  It&#x27;s better to go without and go natural, then have the wrong colour on.  I had high hopes on this one because of some of the stellar reviews, but this was a waste of money for me.  The colours, for some reason, did not match my blonde fair-skinned complexion.  The cream side is the more useful of the two, but it looks odd.  I think the hue should be more cool, and less warm.  The powder side does absolutely nothing.  It doesn&#x27;t add colour, but is supposed to set the cream, but for me there&#x27;s no point setting something that is wrong to begin with.  Plus, the brush provided is terrible.  Use your own.  I only paid a few dollars, but it was more wasted money on something I&#x27;ll never use.</li>
            <li> I found the pigmentation to not be as strong as I expected. Maybe it wasn&#x27;t dark enough for my brows? not sure, but didn&#x27;t fill in as well as I hoped. I will stick with my loreal brow scult pencil for now</li>
            <li> You have the gel to smooth and shape those unruly hairs and a setting powder to lock in the sultry look you&#x27;ve just created. It lasts all day and looks very natural. I&#x27;ve tried some other brands and I felt like when you looked at my face all you could see was BROWS! And no one wants that. This is a great product to fill in the gaps and create a shape. Sometimes I skip the powder because it makes them darker and more dramatic. I am a light almost platinum blonde and this color worked for me. Good luck! Remember eyebrows are sisters not twins!</li>
            <li> Love the color, great for someone who&#x27;s eyebrows are blond, and has darker hair - very natural looking, and no harsh lines like you get with a pencil.</li>
            <li> I must have misread, but this is creamy, not the powder kind. Feels uncomfortable on my skin, even though it&#x27;s just on the eyebrows. Will try to return or maybe just toss out.</li>
            <li> This is awesome. I&#x27;ll be getting another pallet to hold onto just in case these stop being sold... for any insensible reason. Only reason one star is taken off is because there were only 2 color options available when I purchased. The color suits me well too! I just think there are too many skin tones out there for this few of options(This should be available for anybody). Reminds me of how bandaids come in... white. if you catch my racy drift.. Overall, I give the product an emphatic thumbs up.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for the price. Color is perfect for me but brush is terrible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more of a pencil kinda girl, but this does help fill in anything that the pencil for some reason can&#x27;t. or even going over the pencil when its not the right color. nothing matches my eyebrows so I kinda gotta mix colors. this does a good job.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest stuff ever!  It works as well, if not better than a S--box product that sells for 10x the price.  The pigmented gel that you use first looks too light, but the setting powder brings out the color perfectly.  SO impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint--and at $3, who cares--is that the provided brushes are wimpy.  Not a problem, there are plenty of inexpensive angled brushes on the market; use one of those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> Now my gray eyebrows work with my antique blond hair. Have gone from expensive to very affordable. Thank you elf</li>
            <li> I bought the kit in Ash, and Light. I have a really hard time finding shades that match my natural. After using the Light kit for a couple days, I switched to the Ash, and YAYYYYYYY I found something that matches!! I couldn&#x27;t be happier. It took me a little while to get the hang of gel with the brush (its sooo tiny, I got a bigger one), but I&#x27;m in love now.</li>
            <li> Surprised how much i like it actually since it was so inexpensive :)</li>
            <li> I like the combo of the very lightly colored wax and the very lightly colored brow color powder. You could use either one alone, or combine them to control your unruly brows and fill in gaps. I have ash blonde hair and my eyebrows are apparently lighter than any other manufacturer believes eyebrows can be. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of brow products and most won&#x27;t work with ash blonde coloring, so I end up with weird chocolatey or reddish eyebrows. (The exceptions are some brands of eye pencils called \\&quot;Taupe\\&quot; which I also use sometimes, and another eyebrow filler that comes in a tube like mascara.) This e.l.f. eyebrow kit is a great value and provides enough product to last quite a while. I have used it many times already and have barely made a dent in it. I use the [[ASIN:B001A9FQ2W Palladio Cosmetic Angle Liner Brush, 1 Ounce]] to apply it.</li>
            <li> i love this brow kit. Provides what I needed to successfully fill in brows and create a natural look. It is a must have for my kit</li>
            <li> So easy to apply, worked great! I will deffinitley purchase when out in the future, but I&#x27;m sure it will last me a while.</li>
            <li> This product is one of ELF&#x27;s higher raved about items and generally well-recommended among brow products in general so I figured I would give it a shot. I found it was extremely unforgiving, the brush is much too short to get a good grip on so thankfully I have a full size brow brush I used instead. But even so, the powder was so densely packed that it took multiple swipes to even get any product on the brush, and applied streaky onto my brows. The wax was even worse, it was almost like it was mostly dried out and it made my brush harden with the gunk. I wanted to like this because it is so affordable but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> This product is very good.</li>
            <li> Great way to fill in some bare spots on the eyebrows, esp in this color, good for light colored hair, doesn&#x27;t look penciled in, looks natural.</li>
            <li> This says ash, but goes on the brow totally red! Had to throw this away. Also, throw away the brush that comes with it, or you will end up with tons of hairs in the product, which are impossible to get out. Just use any angled liner brush instead (that doesn&#x27;t shed!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can get a color match, great. But I was super disappointed.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister and she has eyebrows now for the first time in her life. She is a natural light blonde and it matches perfectly.</li>
            <li> If you need a great product for your eyebrows with really fast shipping .. Id recommend this product . It is applied smoothly to your eyebrows and doesn&#x27;t leave that drawn on fake look . I Love it ! (:</li>
            <li> I love this dual eyebrow kit. It&#x27;s so hard to find a good one when ur a platinum/ash blonde they all are kinda a weird darker blonde color. These last forever and is actually a true ash blonde color! Def will be a repurchase for the $$</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work very well for me.  I was trying to cover a childhood scar in my brow...</li>
            <li> the teeny, weeny, little brush is so small to use... that you should probably buy 2 brushes to use this kit.  you need a longer handle to control where the make up is going on your face, especially the outline in the gel form.  i am a natural blonde, so i kind of think that the &amp;#34;ash&amp;#34; color is a little too light.  my eyebrows are completely white/yellow blonde, so i wanted them to look a little more dramatic than the &amp;#34;ash&amp;#34; could provide.  this color barely showed up on my face, so i think that i would have gone with a darker color if i could have returned this kit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read a lot of rave reviews, and shannxo, one of my favorite youtubers, always uses this eyebrow kit, and her brows look amazing! Brows are pretty much my favorite part of my routine, because I really think they totally change the way your face looks! I&#x27;m always tweaking them slightly trying to find the perfect method, hence why I tried this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product isn&#x27;t awful by any means, but it&#x27;s not as amazing as I hoped. The blonde color itself is great; I usually have a problem with blonde shades being too yellow or ruddy, but this is a great taupey/ash blonde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the gel, and will probably use it; however, I have a NYX wax pencil I like just is much. What really broke this product for me is the powder; its SO chalky and flaky, and I really have to dig with the brush to get out enough for the color to show up. It seems silly to buy this product just for the gel side, so I will probably use this up, then go back to my Anastasia powder duo + NYX wax pencil.</li>
            <li> At least on me, I like the color (I am somewhat blond girl), and like the fact that I need to use powdery stuff to make it look natural overall.</li>
