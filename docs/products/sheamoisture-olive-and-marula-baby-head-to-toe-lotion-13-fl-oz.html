            <li>I love this product but its OVER PRICED on Amazon.</li>

            <li>Very nice lotion for this 50+ sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Knowing the ingredients are pure and natural makes it the perfect moisturizer for my family.</li>
            <li>Smell so good n light, very moist..</li>
            <li>It feels great &amp; scent is pretty and pretty strong...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend if you&#x27;re looking for a good lotion with out all those yucky chemicals.</li>
            <li>Upon first smelling this, I liked it.</li>
            <li>gave this one to my teenager and she described as a sporty yet sweet scent :)</li>
            <li>Very smooth and smells pretty.</li>
            <li>I love it so much, I began using it myself.</li>
            <li>~ I wanted it for my face &amp; it&#x27;s super perfumy</li>
            <li>I use this for my 19 month old and he just smells so fresh and clean :) Ive also started using it and it makes my skin so nice and soft!</li>
            <li>This one has a delicate, beautiful and unique scent.</li>
            <li>Also in between each use, lotion at the tip of the nozzle solidifies, so the first pump is always just to clean out the gunk.</li>
            <li>Not only does this smell amazing.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t worth the price.</li>
            <li>Very high quality products!</li>
            <li>We were given the first bottle as a gift and</li>
            <li>I picked this up on a whim in Target and love it, not only does my baby use it</li>
            <li>2) feels super soft 3)</li>
            <li>The smell is just too much.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this, as I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for an all-natural lotion with antioxidants and oils.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I tried several different lotions, including California Baby (which I otherwise liked) and nothing helped.  </li>
            <li>, three starts for the smell it gives, I used a little on top of the other lotion that does keep he&#x27;s skin soft, just for the nice baby smell.</li>
            <li>I did not give a five star rating because the pump requires more strength than should be necessary for getting lotion out - particularly for being baby lotion as users will inevitably be trying to operate the bottle with one hand.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not oily or thick, the smell is wonderful because it&#x27;s not a strong smell.</li>
            <li>which is fine just not exactly head to toe as described in my opinion</li>
            <li>They weren&#x27;t even going to immediately ship us a new one for their defected</li>
            <li>I chose this Shea moisture for my 6 month son skin because his skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s scented, prettily but definitely scented.</li>
            <li>My infants skin is on the dry side we started out using The Honest Company when she was born but even with everyday use it</li>
            <li>What causes the smell if all the ingredients are natural?</li>
            <li>My skin feels really soft for hours after using this lotion.</li>
            <li>but so does my 7 year old.</li>
            <li>and it is free of harsh chemicals!  </li>
            <li>My baby&#x27;s arms and legs felt rough like shark skin for the first 9 months.  </li>
            <li>We contacted the company; they told us that we would have to ship it back, and if we wanted a new one, we&#x27;d have to order it again.</li>
            <li>This lotion is rich and thick, and within a week I noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li>One was super runny (not typical) &amp; the other was the thick cream (normal).</li>
            <li>My 5 year old has dry skin and eczema in the winter and every night I lather her in the lotion</li>

            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this company. Very high quality products!</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo and lotion for my newborn...&lt;br /&gt;The good... Smell so good n light, very moist..&lt;br /&gt;The bad...... The pump is a headache ... Take forever to pump out just a bit.&lt;br /&gt;I end up switching the pump for the shampoo..</li>
            <li> I love this product but its OVER PRICED on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Upon first smelling this, I liked it. But when using only a bit on hand and cuticles, I could not tolerate the smell. I&#x27;m so bummed, as it has beneficial ingredients for the skin. I would NEVER use this on a child&#x27;s body. The smell is just too much. What causes the smell if all the ingredients are natural? I really wanted to like this, as I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for an all-natural lotion with antioxidants and oils. Any suggestions? Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> Superb lotion!  No junk in the ingredient list.  Very smooth and smells pretty.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t worth the price.</li>

It seems that the thickness of the lotion has something to do with both issues. Overall, the smell and quality of the product is worth the slightly irritating dispenser issues.</li>
            <li> My family loves this lotion! I use this for my 19 month old and he just smells so fresh and clean :) Ive also started using it and it makes my skin so nice and soft!</li>
            <li> I ordered this after it was recommended by a friend, I was told it was unscented...needless to say it is not. It didn&#x27;t meet my needs as I wanted an unscented lotion but that&#x27;s my fault for not reading description &amp; listening to a friend &amp; one-click ordering! It feels great &amp; scent is pretty and pretty strong...which is fine just not exactly head to toe as described in my opinion ~ I wanted it for my face &amp; it&#x27;s super perfumy ~ still gave it 5* cuz I didn&#x27;t read description or reviews &amp; that&#x27;s not their fault ~ but I never leave reviews so I wanted to just in case others read them ~ to summarize: 1) it&#x27;s scented, prettily but definitely scented. 2) feels super soft 3) a little goes a long way 4) I ordered their unscented &amp; love it ~ gave this one to my teenager and she described as a sporty yet sweet scent :)</li>
            <li> I use this on my son&#x27;s skin after baths and in his cloth diaper wipe solution. Haven&#x27;t seen any adverse reactions. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Excellent, thank-you.</li>
            <li> My baby&#x27;s arms and legs felt rough like shark skin for the first 9 months.

            <li> This is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used on my baby. He gets severely dry skin espiecially during the winter months. It even protects his skin from diaper rash. I love it so much, I began using it myself. It also smells incredible</li>
            <li> This is great-- smells and feels good !!&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY it from this dealer !!&lt;br /&gt;BUY it from Bed Bath and Beyond/Harmon for only $9.99 ONLY !!</li>
            <li> Silky smooth with a delightful light fragrance. Very nice lotion for this 50+ sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> the absolute best lotion for anyone. My 5 year old has dry skin and eczema in the winter and every night I lather her in the lotion and she stays for moisturized. I use it too! Smells great!</li>

            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell. My son skin didn&#x27;t like it at all. Had to return it.</li>
            <li> Not only does this smell amazing. It works great! Not just for babies, I use this myself. I highly recommend if you&#x27;re looking for a good lotion with out all those yucky chemicals.</li>
            <li> My infants skin is on the dry side we started out using The Honest Company when she was born but even with everyday use it her skin remained dry. I picked this up on a whim in Target and love it, not only does my baby use it but so does my 7 year old. Very moisturizing and smells amazing! There are lower prices out there I try to buy it when it&#x27;s on sale at the drug stores.</li>
            <li> I still have no idea what this product is like. Unfortunately, the moisturizer for my infant&#x27;s peeling skin came days later than it was supposed to, and when I received it the pump was cracked off. We contacted the company; they told us that we would have to ship it back, and if we wanted a new one, we&#x27;d have to order it again. They weren&#x27;t even going to immediately ship us a new one for their defected product!&lt;br /&gt;This is an infant we are talking about, who needs the moisturizer now, not next week, when the next bottle comes...&lt;br /&gt;I am beyond annoyed, and as a new mom, I don&#x27;t have the time nor the strength to be running to the pharmacy for every need.&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely upset by this situation and would not recommend ordering this product from this seller.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 of these. One was super runny (not typical) &amp; the other was the thick cream (normal).</li>
