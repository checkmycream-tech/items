            <li>This cream feels so good on my face</li>
            <li>Also, it was fascinating to learn how the venom is extracted from bees without harming them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I am delighted to say this is a product that delivers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anything that boosts circulation is a good thing.</li>
            <li>surprisingly works</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Very nice packaging - my wife made it a point to state that it was as nice as high-end cosmetics</li>
            <li>venom is also very interesting.</li>
            <li>venom is also very interesting.</li>
            <li>I tried a sample (which I received from the manufacturer in exchange for a fair and honest review).  </li>
            <li>Scientists are now studying it more closely because it seems to be working to treat antibiotic-resistant infections like MRSA because it inhibits the growth of bacteria!</li>
            <li>my wife and I tried out this Beenigma (Love that name!)</li>
            <li>My skin was in pretty good shape anyway, but the velvety softness this product added to my skin was incredible.  </li>
            <li>Any fine lines I had around my eyes are gone and some of my cheek creases are gone or greatly diminished.</li>
            <li>My neck feels ever so slightly warm, almost as though it&#x27;s about to feel irritated, but then doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I was offered a chance to test out the Bee Venom Cream Mask to provide an honest review.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m delighted to recommend this face cream and plan to buy more when this is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I hadn&#x27;t seen it with my own eyes (and felt it, too . .</li>
            <li>and I am loving it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sure it works, and it comes in a gift-quality bottle with nice presentation, but like all products of this kind its effects are temporary.</li>

            <li>--I have a jar of Manuka Honey and it tastes so good, you could easily use it as a spread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so good, you could easily use it as a spread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice looking jar, that can sit on your bathroom counter top without screaming &amp;#34;wrinkle cream&amp;#34; to any guests who may use the restroom.</li>
            <li>It also brightens the skin, gives it a nice healthy glow.</li>
            <li>I am still LOVING this product and what it continues to do for me :) and I already ordered another jar.s</li>
            <li>I am still LOVING this product and what it continues to do for me :) and I already ordered another jar.</li>
            <li>It does include Manuka honey, and I am aware that that is a great product, but bee venom?</li>
            <li>The first application gives you a sting, which I thought was great.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s mentioned that it contains Shea Butter (which I love).</li>
            <li>two weeks, I&#x27;ve seen my skin texture improve more than with any drug store moisturizer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>for many, many years.</li>
            <li>product has a lovely scent, a creamy honey smell that lingers for a bit but never bothered me.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s okay with me.</li>
            <li>In any case, my wife is extremely pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>both things you should be sure of before using this</li>
            <li>I can say is that it has made my skin look and feel better.</li>
            <li>It has made my skin more supple.</li>
            <li>These are questions that I am sure inquiring minds wish to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make sure that you are not allergic to bee and/or wasp venom.</li>
            <li>you are in the market for a high-quality beauty cream that does more than make your skin greasy, smell like a florist shop, and does more than layer chemicals onto your face with no noticeable improvement, Beenigma is a godsend.</li>
            <li>I did have a reaction, so be sure to test before applying.  </li>
            <li>She also tested to make sure she had no reactions before we started, and didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a free bottle of Bee-Venom-Cream-Mask for an honest review.</li>
            <li>I use it in the morning and it makes my skin look healthy.</li>
            <li>my face looks tigher, more toned.  </li>
            <li>Too many products boast about \\&quot;visible\\&quot; results that need a magnifying glass to see.  </li>

            <li>Five rejuvenated stars for a skin care product that&#x27;s more than hope in a jar.</li>
            <li>I have frown and forehead lines that are more more substantial than I would like.</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of touching my eyes after applying the cream and I will never do it again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Many companies use parabens as a preservative, to give the product a longer shelf life.  </li>
            <li>It also says it is a CUMULATIVE product, which means the longer you use it, the more benefits you suck up through your skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was so impressed by this product, that I took the extra time to provide you with some research and a lot of information.  </li>

            <li>I am just fooling myself but to be able to find another cream that will work one has to try and trying is what I do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll start with the knowledge that my skin is usually pretty good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s especially good around the eyes, where it also helps with minor puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>have to say that even though this jar was provided for me to test out, I would be happy to purchase new jars to continue the benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>But really, after using this for just about a month now, I can honestly say that my skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li>But we&#x27;re not so lucky and the price is prohibitive for us to keep up with Beenigma, no matter how effective it</li>

            <li>If you give me the chance to safely rub bee venom all over my face, I&#x27;m going to take it--I&#x27;ve also drank liquor filled with scorpions and venomous snakes.</li>
            <li>It absorbs very quickly</li>
            <li>I have used Oil of Olay before, and while it moisturizes and applies easily, there was always a lingering greasiness on my fingers and face.</li>
            <li>It has strong fragrance that I can&#x27;t quite describe.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more even and the lines on my face are minimizing right before my eyes!</li>
            <li>It could be the best cream in the world, but risking anaphylactic shock is not worth your beauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>first, I washed off the mask after thirty minutes, but I discovered that it had the best effect when I applied it as a night cream and left it on overnight.</li>

            <li>/&gt;Beenigma, as I mentioned above, is a great cream.</li>
            <li>It does smooth your skin and help to make it tauter.&lt;br</li>

            <li>Since it is so dense, it does not glide on smoothly but it disappears quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Without drying my face, I applied a light coating of Bee Nigma, massaging it into my face and neck.</li>
            <li>Some kinds of honey may be 100 times more powerful than others.  </li>
            <li>My skin tingles very slightly and feels wonderful.</li>
            <li>It may not be The New Botox, but it&#x27;s one of the best topical skin care products I&#x27;ve tried and it does appear to minimize fine lines, skin discolorations and even some light scars.  </li>
            <li>It spreads easily on the face and is absorbed easily as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very mild though and dissipates quickly, so</li>
            <li>My wife has never had a significant number of wrinkles her face</li>
            <li>I watched it disappear mostly over the first two weeks of use.</li>
            <li>; given the small size of the container and the cost of the product, I think that the conservative application is the best</li>
            <li>/&gt;Beenigma, in short, is an excellent beauty cream that definitely excels in making your face feel smoother, sexier, and confident.</li>
            <li>I was excited and thankful to be asked to review this cream.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with this product and it has far exceeded my expectations!  </li>
            <li>I am thrilled with this product and it has far exceeded my expectations!  </li>
            <li>If I felt that it had changed for the better, then it probably had, even if the results were not dramatic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been paying special attention to them with this [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>So I was delighted to receive a sample of Beenigma directly from the manufacturer in exchange for an honest review - I would have never bought this for myself, especially when almost every anti-aging product out there is snake oil.</li>
            <li>It smells like the manuka honey it contains, which is a nice, natural scent and not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve thrown out perfectly good jars of face cream that left an oily or sticky feeling on my face, but this product does neither.</li>
            <li>Spending this kind of money on a beauty treatment is a considerable investment.</li>
            <li>I have been fairly dedicated to applying this cream, and I think it could potentially work for others.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been fairly dedicated to applying this cream, and I think it could potentially work for others.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I admit to wanting to try this out because it sounded so cool.</li>
            <li>Me, not so lucky--</li>
            <li>Now, after about ten days of using Beenigma twice a day, she is very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>More nutrients and more oxygen mean that even older skin has what it needs to produce stronger cells and, most important, stronger and more limber collagen and elastin.</li>
            <li>During our thirty years of marriage, I&#x27;ve seen thousands of dollars worth of cosmetics come into our bathroom, and most of them got tossed out eventually to make room for a new crop of creams and lotions that promised to be the Fountain of Youth (they weren&#x27;t).</li>
            <li>After four days of this, she said there was a noticeable improvement in her \\&quot;smile line\\&quot; and acne scars.</li>
            <li>sister-in-law, who lives with us and is 60 years old, asked if she could try it and that would allow me to see how it worked on someone and be able to review it.</li>
            <li>I inherited deep crow&#x27;s feet from my father, and all of my brothers have the kind of eyes you could run rivers through.</li>
            <li>Many products claim fast results, but don&#x27;t really deliver as we hope.  </li>
            <li>I noticed how much more ALIVE</li>

            <li>wife said that the first couple of times, she felt a mild tingling, presumably from the bee venom in Beenigma, but after that, she didn&#x27;t notice it anymore.</li>
            <li>And, when you see an unexplained bright light coming from across a dimly lit room, it is probably just the glow coming from someone&#x27;s skin--someone who is using BEE NIGMA!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>

            <li>You heard me right.  </li>
            <li>This is due to a high concentration of Mellitan, a very powerful anti-inflammatory, about 100 times more potent than hydrocortisone.  </li>

            <li>cream is expensive and comes packaged appropriately - a lovely box and a beautiful jar.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re even slightly interested in the product, it&#x27;s worth a trip to the company&#x27;s website to learn how the bee venom and Manuka honey are believed to work in the skin.</li>
            <li>I use a little more of it around my eyes, where I have the most signs of aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cream disappears quickly and really seems to hydrate without leaving any greasy feel.</li>
            <li>When I showed her the backs of my hands and asked her to choose which hand looked better, she unhesitatingly chose the hand I&#x27;ve been using the cream on as looking much younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is gentle and not unpleasant and the cream leaves no greasy feel.  </li>
            <li>But as I entered into my 49th year, I was gifted with my first brown age spot, right in the middle of my cheek.</li>
            <li>Nigma&#x27;s website explains the use of the bees from New Zealand that are producing the Manuka Honey from the Manuka Plant, which grows in New Zealand (more about Manuka Honey follows).  </li>
            <li>No, not a twenty year old, but her skin looks healthy and vibrant.  </li>
            <li>It may be the honey, which is not only an exceptional moisturizer, but also a natural antibacterial, so it fights inflammations, acne and infections.</li>
            <li>&quot; At first, I scoffed at him.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I noticed just the tiniest of tingles</li>
            <li>or so I apply my regular moisturizer over the top.</li>
            <li>I first applied the product under my chin to test for an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li>I did not encounter the itchiness or the tingling from the first day.</li>
            <li>I only use the St. Ives product once a day, but once it was introduced, the frown lines began to diminish more rapidly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is NOT one of those jars with a smaller jar inside like some products do to make you think you are getting more of a product.  </li>
            <li>Rubbing just the right quantity of bee venom stimulates your skin and sort of \\&quot;exercises it\\&quot; to fill in the wrinkles with nice, fresh collagen and put a little more life back into your sagging flesh.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not exactly what I&#x27;d call a floral scent, but more of a clean soap smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She really enjoys the natural fragrance (a bit like honey, but not as strong) and the tingling sensation she experiences when it is on her face.</li>
            <li>It certainly agrees with my skin and makes it feel and look better which is ultimately all I care</li>
            <li>Just be certain the first time you use it, to try it out before you have to go out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample of Beenigma for reviewing purposes, but no promise for a positive review was made or implied.</li>
            <li>While I can&#x27;t claim that this is all true, but so far the results seem to positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so i&#x27;m able to apply my foundation and other makeup right away.</li>

            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used it less than two weeks and am thrilled with my results.</li>
            <li>, I certainly would not wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that my facial skin has a smoother texture, and the fine lines around my mouth have plumped up a bit.</li>

            <li>I wonder if this product really works for my age being thirty with acne</li>
            <li>Since these go much deeper than the skin layers they have not gone away</li>
            <li>The question is: Does it really work?&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;In week three, I started to use St. Ives Blemish &amp; Blackhead Control Apricot Scrub, 6 oz in conjunction with this product and that is when I really started to begin noticing an impact on my skin.</li>

            <li>And we want to see results fast.  </li>

            <li>Conversely, the smooth coverage of the Beenigma cream was wonderful: a little swatch goes a long way, there is no strong odor, and I could snap my fingers with no issues.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see spending money on beauty products when we have so many other expenses and obligations.</li>
            <li>After not noticing any significant reaction, I proceeded to use the product the next day all over my face.</li>
            <li>had also read the other reviews and was aware that some people thought it had a strong scent.</li>

            <li>The bee venom in Beenigma is supposed to stimulate the skin into producing collagen and elastin - two proteins our young faces produce but our older faces lack.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fragrance: I was surprised to read in a few reviews that some people didn&#x27;t like the fragrance, because I really love it.</li>
            <li>The sensation of tightness did come back, but it was not uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>I was pretty skeptical about the effectivity of this; almost every \\&quot;miracle ingredient\\&quot; turns out to be more mundane than magic.</li>
            <li>Beenigma, on the other hand, lasted a full twelve hours.</li>
            <li>Over the next week, I experienced the occasional tingling -- the kind you&#x27;d get from an astringent -- and a few quick stabs near my temple, but nothing unpleasant enough to make me stop.</li>
            <li>Her skin was more supple, the lines were not as deep, and the old acne scars were less pronounced.</li>
            <li>Still, just to be certain that I wasn&#x27;t falling for the placebo effect, I took before, during, and two-weeks-in photographs using the same, lip-parted, smile-less, and, yes, unflattering shot after washing my face in the morning.</li>

            <li>It is made in New Zealand, with the active ingredients (in this order) of New Zealand Bee Venom and Manuka Honey.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;According to the product description (as well as the literature contained with the product packaging), Beenigma takes advantage of New Zealand bee venom, Manuka honey, shea butter, and a few other chemical tongue-twisters in their facial lotion to smooth skin and eliminate wrinkles.</li>
            <li>My neck is less crepey, my face is more plumped and youthful looking, and definitely my eye bags and crows feet are less noticeable.</li>

            <li> both things you should be sure of before using this</li>
            <li> I can say is that it has made my skin look and feel better.</li>
            <li> It has made my skin more supple.</li>
            <li> These are questions that I am sure inquiring minds wish to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Make sure that you are not allergic to bee and/or wasp venom.</li>
            <li> you are in the market for a high-quality beauty cream that does more than make your skin greasy, smell like a florist shop, and does more than layer chemicals onto your face with no noticeable improvement, Beenigma is a godsend.</li>
            <li> I did have a reaction, so be sure to test before applying.  </li>
            <li> She also tested to make sure she had no reactions before we started, and didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a free bottle of Bee-Venom-Cream-Mask for an honest review.</li>
            <li> I use it in the morning and it makes my skin look healthy.</li>

            <li> I have frown and forehead lines that are more more substantial than I would like.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of touching my eyes after applying the cream and I will never do it again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Many companies use parabens as a preservative, to give the product a longer shelf life.  </li>
            <li> It also says it is a CUMULATIVE product, which means the longer you use it, the more benefits you suck up through your skin.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ll start with the knowledge that my skin is usually pretty good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s especially good around the eyes, where it also helps with minor puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> have to say that even though this jar was provided for me to test out, I would be happy to purchase new jars to continue the benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> If you give me the chance to safely rub bee venom all over my face, I&#x27;m going to take it--I&#x27;ve also drank liquor filled with scorpions and venomous snakes.</li>
            <li> It absorbs very quickly</li>
            <li> I have used Oil of Olay before, and while it moisturizes and applies easily, there was always a lingering greasiness on my fingers and face.</li>
            <li> It has strong fragrance that I can&#x27;t quite describe.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more even and the lines on my face are minimizing right before my eyes!</li>
            <li> It could be the best cream in the world, but risking anaphylactic shock is not worth your beauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> first, I washed off the mask after thirty minutes, but I discovered that it had the best effect when I applied it as a night cream and left it on overnight.</li>

            <li> Without drying my face, I applied a light coating of Bee Nigma, massaging it into my face and neck.</li>
            <li> Some kinds of honey may be 100 times more powerful than others.  </li>
            <li> My skin tingles very slightly and feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> It may not be The New Botox, but it&#x27;s one of the best topical skin care products I&#x27;ve tried and it does appear to minimize fine lines, skin discolorations and even some light scars.  </li>
            <li> It spreads easily on the face and is absorbed easily as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very mild though and dissipates quickly, so</li>

            <li> I watched it disappear mostly over the first two weeks of use.</li>
            <li> ; given the small size of the container and the cost of the product, I think that the conservative application is the best</li>
            <li> /&gt;Beenigma, in short, is an excellent beauty cream that definitely excels in making your face feel smoother, sexier, and confident.</li>
            <li> I was excited and thankful to be asked to review this cream.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with this product and it has far exceeded my expectations!  </li>
            <li> I am thrilled with this product and it has far exceeded my expectations!  </li>
            <li> If I felt that it had changed for the better, then it probably had, even if the results were not dramatic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been paying special attention to them with this [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> So I was delighted to receive a sample of Beenigma directly from the manufacturer in exchange for an honest review - I would have never bought this for myself, especially when almost every anti-aging product out there is snake oil.</li>
            <li> It smells like the manuka honey it contains, which is a nice, natural scent and not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve thrown out perfectly good jars of face cream that left an oily or sticky feeling on my face, but this product does neither.</li>
            <li> Spending this kind of money on a beauty treatment is a considerable investment.</li>
            <li> I have been fairly dedicated to applying this cream, and I think it could potentially work for others.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I admit to wanting to try this out because it sounded so cool.</li>
            <li> Me, not so lucky--</li>
            <li> Now, after about ten days of using Beenigma twice a day, she is very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> More nutrients and more oxygen mean that even older skin has what it needs to produce stronger cells and, most important, stronger and more limber collagen and elastin.</li>
            <li> During our thirty years of marriage, I&#x27;ve seen thousands of dollars worth of cosmetics come into our bathroom, and most of them got tossed out eventually to make room for a new crop of creams and lotions that promised to be the Fountain of Youth (they weren&#x27;t).</li>
            <li> After four days of this, she said there was a noticeable improvement in her \\&quot;smile line\\&quot; and acne scars.</li>
            <li> sister-in-law, who lives with us and is 60 years old, asked if she could try it and that would allow me to see how it worked on someone and be able to review it.</li>
            <li> I inherited deep crow&#x27;s feet from my father, and all of my brothers have the kind of eyes you could run rivers through.</li>
            <li> Many products claim fast results, but don&#x27;t really deliver as we hope.  </li>
            <li> I noticed how much more ALIVE</li>

            <li> wife said that the first couple of times, she felt a mild tingling, presumably from the bee venom in Beenigma, but after that, she didn&#x27;t notice it anymore.</li>
            <li> And, when you see an unexplained bright light coming from across a dimly lit room, it is probably just the glow coming from someone&#x27;s skin--someone who is using BEE NIGMA!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>

            <li> After some thought, however, I realized that he was right in a way</li>
            <li> is that I can see a difference right away.  </li>
            <li> You heard me right.  </li>
            <li> This is due to a high concentration of Mellitan, a very powerful anti-inflammatory, about 100 times more potent than hydrocortisone.  </li>

            <li> I have seen noticeable positive results OVERNIGHT!  </li>

            <li> cream is expensive and comes packaged appropriately - a lovely box and a beautiful jar.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re even slightly interested in the product, it&#x27;s worth a trip to the company&#x27;s website to learn how the bee venom and Manuka honey are believed to work in the skin.</li>
            <li> I use a little more of it around my eyes, where I have the most signs of aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cream disappears quickly and really seems to hydrate without leaving any greasy feel.</li>
            <li> When I showed her the backs of my hands and asked her to choose which hand looked better, she unhesitatingly chose the hand I&#x27;ve been using the cream on as looking much younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is gentle and not unpleasant and the cream leaves no greasy feel.  </li>
            <li> But as I entered into my 49th year, I was gifted with my first brown age spot, right in the middle of my cheek.</li>
            <li> Nigma&#x27;s website explains the use of the bees from New Zealand that are producing the Manuka Honey from the Manuka Plant, which grows in New Zealand (more about Manuka Honey follows).  </li>
            <li> No, not a twenty year old, but her skin looks healthy and vibrant.  </li>
            <li> It may be the honey, which is not only an exceptional moisturizer, but also a natural antibacterial, so it fights inflammations, acne and infections.</li>
            <li> &quot; At first, I scoffed at him.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I noticed just the tiniest of tingles</li>
            <li> or so I apply my regular moisturizer over the top.</li>
            <li> I first applied the product under my chin to test for an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> I did not encounter the itchiness or the tingling from the first day.</li>
            <li> I only use the St. Ives product once a day, but once it was introduced, the frown lines began to diminish more rapidly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is NOT one of those jars with a smaller jar inside like some products do to make you think you are getting more of a product.  </li>
            <li> Rubbing just the right quantity of bee venom stimulates your skin and sort of \\&quot;exercises it\\&quot; to fill in the wrinkles with nice, fresh collagen and put a little more life back into your sagging flesh.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not exactly what I&#x27;d call a floral scent, but more of a clean soap smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She really enjoys the natural fragrance (a bit like honey, but not as strong) and the tingling sensation she experiences when it is on her face.</li>
            <li> It certainly agrees with my skin and makes it feel and look better which is ultimately all I care</li>
            <li> Just be certain the first time you use it, to try it out before you have to go out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample of Beenigma for reviewing purposes, but no promise for a positive review was made or implied.</li>
            <li> While I can&#x27;t claim that this is all true, but so far the results seem to positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;m able to apply my foundation and other makeup right away.</li>
            <li> To be considered potent enough to be therapeutic, Manuka honey needs a minimum rating of 10 UMF (Unique Manuka Factor - standard).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it less than two weeks and am thrilled with my results.</li>
            <li> , I certainly would not wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that my facial skin has a smoother texture, and the fine lines around my mouth have plumped up a bit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Very high quality ingredients - nothing about the product from fragrance, packaging, consistency, to results have any signs of being a gimmicky&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend doing a patch test first to check for sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wonder if this product really works for my age being thirty with acne</li>
            <li> Since these go much deeper than the skin layers they have not gone away</li>
            <li> The question is: Does it really work?&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;In week three, I started to use St. Ives Blemish &amp; Blackhead Control Apricot Scrub, 6 oz in conjunction with this product and that is when I really started to begin noticing an impact on my skin.</li>
            <li> Wash face and gently massage, a generous layer to your neck and face.</li>
            <li> And we want to see results fast.  </li>
            <li> Although I received this product as a free sample for potential review, I thoroughly intend to purchase it when my sample runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Conversely, the smooth coverage of the Beenigma cream was wonderful: a little swatch goes a long way, there is no strong odor, and I could snap my fingers with no issues.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see spending money on beauty products when we have so many other expenses and obligations.</li>
            <li> After not noticing any significant reaction, I proceeded to use the product the next day all over my face.</li>
            <li> had also read the other reviews and was aware that some people thought it had a strong scent.</li>

            <li> From the lack of a strong odor and how it is quickly absorbed by my skin are the least of the benefits gained when using Beenigma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> The bee venom in Beenigma is supposed to stimulate the skin into producing collagen and elastin - two proteins our young faces produce but our older faces lack.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fragrance: I was surprised to read in a few reviews that some people didn&#x27;t like the fragrance, because I really love it.</li>
            <li> The sensation of tightness did come back, but it was not uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical about the effectivity of this; almost every \\&quot;miracle ingredient\\&quot; turns out to be more mundane than magic.</li>
            <li> Beenigma, on the other hand, lasted a full twelve hours.</li>
            <li> Over the next week, I experienced the occasional tingling -- the kind you&#x27;d get from an astringent -- and a few quick stabs near my temple, but nothing unpleasant enough to make me stop.</li>
            <li> Her skin was more supple, the lines were not as deep, and the old acne scars were less pronounced.</li>
            <li> Still, just to be certain that I wasn&#x27;t falling for the placebo effect, I took before, during, and two-weeks-in photographs using the same, lip-parted, smile-less, and, yes, unflattering shot after washing my face in the morning.</li>

            <li> started using Beenigma several weeks ago, and as I saw the improvements day by day I started researching, reading reviews and having to admit that this bee venom thing really does work.</li>
            <li> I think it has a soft, almost baby powder like smell.</li>
            <li> As a skeptic, I was pretty critical in my expectations, especially for something with a price tag of more than 4 times what I usually spend on face</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t completely gone away but it is still getting lighter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a middle aged woman with the same complaints most women</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Melittin can absorb toxins, but it also soaks in oxygen, amino acids and hormones that can give your skin a natural rejuvenation.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t much of a \\&quot;mask,\\&quot; which implies to me some opaque treatment that you later wash off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been fighting against that with sunscreen and product and have so far maintained the fort.</li>

            <li> It has not really help with my forehead lines which are the biggest wrinkled areas, but my smile, nose and crows feet have improved significantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cause any redness and it makes a wonderful base for makeup to be applied over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The process is painstaking: One gram of venom from New Zealand, a major producer, is the equivalent of 10,000 bee stings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what mechanism is at work here, but apparently the bee venom stimulates growth of new skin cells or something like that.</li>

            <li> I was wary at first, expecting a red face, some kind of reaction, tingling or something that would bring the reality home that this cream contains bee venom.</li>
            <li> My face looked slightly (not a lot) smoother and tighter, whether because of the bee toxin or because of the effects of the honey cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s packaged like a high end facial cream.</li>
            <li> Rather than use this as a heavy mask, I&#x27;ve been applying it after cleaning my face every morning and night, paying special attention to those wrinkles at the corners of my mouth.  </li>

            <li> Since no cream offers eye-popping results, I&#x27;d say yes, if you are inclined to using high-end creams to improve elasticity and general tone.</li>

            <li> Bee venom is often found in the better lip plumpers because it makes them lips look fuller and softens the vertical lines that make a face look tired and old, and that make lipstick &#x27;bleed.&#x27;</li>

            <li> It remains on the skin surface feeling moist for a few minutes, then it absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;According to Paltrow, it also erases minor scars, even older ones.  </li>
            <li> cream gives my face a very slight tingle (but no redness) when I apply it, and soaks in quickly without leaving my face feeling greasy at all.</li>

            <li> And, while you will not have any ursine men lusting after you, I wouldn’t be surprised if a human or two made a pass.&lt;br</li>

            <li> It is made in New Zealand, with the active ingredients (in this order) of New Zealand Bee Venom and Manuka Honey.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;According to the product description (as well as the literature contained with the product packaging), Beenigma takes advantage of New Zealand bee venom, Manuka honey, shea butter, and a few other chemical tongue-twisters in their facial lotion to smooth skin and eliminate wrinkles.</li>
            <li> My neck is less crepey, my face is more plumped and youthful looking, and definitely my eye bags and crows feet are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> The immediate feeling upon the first application was a slight tingling and a tightness.</li>
            <li> the first application I did feel a slight tingle, but after continuous use that seems to fade away.</li>

            <li> My wife uses a very small amount, primarily around her eyes, each night before she goes to bed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bee Nigma states their Manuka Honey has a 20+ UMF rating, out of a possible 5 - 25 UMF rating standard developed by honey producers.  </li>
            <li> My dark spot is now very faded -- almost gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve barely dented the contents of my jar, so I expect the jar to last for a couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious to know: How quickly it would be before the deepness of my previous lines</li>
            <li> Both my wife and I are very pleased with the results, and far less skeptical about the effectivity of bee venom.</li>

            <li> the first day, she tried rubbing in a little Beenigma on a part of the left side of her face as a test.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way and bringing out a youthful glow makes Beenigma worth its weight in gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> The cream is thick and quickly absorbs into your skin.</li>
            <li> The cream is thick but easily applied; I used the stick to swipe streaks of cream under my eyes, across both cheeks, on the center of my forehead, and on my chin.</li>
            <li> In other words, it&#x27;s powerful stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since both of these main ingredients fight infection and inflammation - things that accelerate aging when chronically present in the body - it&#x27;s not surprising to me that it can have a visible impact on aging</li>

            <li> I was naturally nervous about applying it to my face, even though my arm had no redness or other effects beyond the initial stinging.</li>
            <li> The biggest question for consumers is cost: Are subtle effects worth the price?</li>

            <li> The only concern remains for her is the possible long term effect of placing bee venom on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s tried Mederna and countless other facial creams, but they were either too harsh, too drying, or largely ineffective.</li>
            <li> long will my results last?</li>
            <li> They jar is a generous amount that will last you a long time!</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about the bee venom and the honey; fortunately when I stepped outside I wasn’t mauled by a bear.</li>
            <li> Some of the other general ingredients include shea butter, honey and almond oil.  </li>
            <li> Well, three and a half weeks later and not a single break out!</li>
            <li> Because of hormonal problems when she was much younger, she has a number of facial scars from acne and other skin ailments.</li>
            <li> Would I break out in giant red spots due to an allergy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a middle aged mom whose beauty routine consists of washing my face with a bar of soap when I shower and maybe remembering to put some drug store cream on my face before bed.</li>
            <li> I am careful about sun exposure and always wear my sunscreen, but age and gravity are starting to show in the wrinkles and eye bags on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like any elastic that is constantly stretched, after a while the collagen and elastin fibers get saggy and baggy -- and so does our skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This means that if you have sensitve skin, lots of minor breakouts, or rough and scaly patches, Beenigma may be a big help.  </li>
            <li> There is a very slight smell, but it is a natural smell, NOT fragrance.  </li>
            <li> The texture and application of this cream is definitely neater than other, cheaper creams.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, Beenigma won&#x27;t erase those deep creases between the eybrows or on the forehead, or the Howdy Doody lines around the mouth.</li>
            <li> Only Botox or other fillers work on those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cream is thick and very slightly waxy, but not unpleasantly so.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel dry anymore.</li>
            <li> With the dry heat from running the furnace, my skin dries out and sometimes cracks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been battling acne in the nose area and around my nostrils for almost a year, and it has completely cleared up in the past couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> After about 3 weeks, I don&#x27;t really notice any \\&quot;permanent\\&quot; improvement of the sort you might expect from Botox, but there is a very obvious difference in those lines I hate so much, particularly for several hours after applying the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grandma</li>
            <li> Worth trying since even at $130 for a small jar, it&#x27;s less than the usual dermatological procedures needed to get rid of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> She told me that she did feel a little sting on her face, but nothing unbearable, and her face did get a tad red as well.</li>
            <li> These make up the tiny little connector fibers that hold your skin in place.  </li>
            <li> Nothing like a little physical sensation to show you that it is working.</li>
            <li> Botox also has no real therapeutic value.</li>
            <li> It makes a nice base for face make up.  </li>
            <li> Let me tell you, this cream works, plain and simple.</li>
            <li> (although I did in my younger years), I don&#x27;t use foundation or other heavy makeup either.</li>
            <li> She added that a little bit goes a long way, but she informed me that we will be purchasing another jar when this one runs out.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but willing to give it</li>
            <li> She also said that her skin pores appeared to be smaller, but without the excessive drying that other products had produced.</li>
            <li> Still, there are those few tiny crow&#x27;s feet, a couple of lines across my forehead, and most annoyingly, those inherited lines at the corners of my mouth that give me a \\&quot;hang</li>
            <li> I have oily skin so after I wash it, I usually use some sort of cream to give moisture back to the parts that aren&#x27;t oily.</li>
            <li> There is no stinging, burn, tingle, or other sensation when applying this</li>
            <li> Beenigma won&#x27;t take ten years off your face, but it will make the face you have look a little smoother, a little healthier.</li>

            <li> After applying them, they start to single a bit, causing circulation to increase and the lips to get a little fuller appearance.</li>
            <li> When a bee stings you it is the active component \\&quot;Melittin\\&quot; that causes the localized pain and inflammation at the injected part of your body.</li>
            <li> If it works on scars, it may also work on dark patches and sun damage.  </li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the effects are long term, but the cream, while expensive, costs a lot less than Botox which works extremely well on deep wrinkles caused by contracting muscles, but can&#x27;t help that quilted look</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Bee Venom Mask for a few weeks now, applying it at night before I go to sleep, then again in the morning after my shower.</li>

            <li> This process, however, always leaves part of my skin looking really dried out.</li>
            <li> Since using this product, my skin no longer has that dried out look in some parts.</li>
            <li> The itchiness set in after a few hours.</li>
            <li> At approximately two uses per day, I have used about a third of a jar.</li>
            <li> My face glows, it is extremely soft and a majority of the lines lines are faint.</li>
            <li> At first, my wife was very skeptical of Beenigma and thought that it was another in a long line of creams offering false promises.</li>
            <li> I have to say that the scent of this product, which is very slight, doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> It smells very slightly like honey.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Beenigma comes in a small glass container and includes a plastic applicator (there is a small indentation at one end that is akin to a spoon).</li>
            <li> I had no idea that expensive facial creams could reduce wrinkles AND discipline</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I got a recommendation for this moisturizer from a friend of mine that loves this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I have changed a lot of my personal care items and cleaning products for those that have ingredients that I can pronounce and know what they are, which is why Beenigma caught my attention.&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that Beenigma is the best moisturizer that I have ever used. It absorbs very quickly so i&#x27;m able to apply my foundation and other makeup right away. I noticed that it lifted my wrinkles and smoothed my skin after only couple days. My husband uses it too and loves it as well.</li>
            <li> At first, my wife was very skeptical of Beenigma and thought that it was another in a long line of creams offering false promises. After three weeks of use my wife has not only been won over, but she is recommending Beenigma to her friends. My wife has never had a significant number of wrinkles her face but now her skin is noticeably smoother. She really enjoys the natural fragrance (a bit like honey, but not as strong) and the tingling sensation she experiences when it is on her face. The only concern remains for her is the possible long term effect of placing bee venom on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beenigma claims that bee Venom is one of nature&#x27;s most powerful agents for producing collagen and elastin production. This helps to reduce wrinkles and reverse the signs of aging. While I can&#x27;t claim that this is all true, but so far the results seem to positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes/Directions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Can be used as a nightly/morning moisturizer or it can be used a face mask (3 nights a week for 20 minutes per usage). My wife uses a very small amount, primarily around her eyes, each night before she goes to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Do not use if you have any bee allergies&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Very nice packaging - my wife made it a point to state that it was as nice as high-end cosmetics&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- My wife has not had any type of skin reaction ...rash or otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- As a nightly moisturizer she preferred Beenigma to her typical regimen of Origins moisturizer... she also thinks that it compares favorably to Lancome (which is at a similar price point)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Very high quality ingredients - nothing about the product from fragrance, packaging, consistency, to results have any signs of being a gimmicky&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- You definitely will want to take a look at the Beenigma webpage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final verdict - After three weeks Beenigma turned a couple of skeptics into believers. In truth, when I was offered the product for reviewing purposes we almost didn&#x27;t accept.... we thought that at best it would be a wast of time.... or at worst we would have a strong reaction with our skin. In the three weeks she has been using the product her opinion has completely reversed and now she is recommending it to her friends and family. Highly Recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 Stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note we were provided a sample for reviewing purposesght that at best it would be a wast of time.... or at worst we would have a strong reaction with our skin.

            <li> I use this cream mainly for a noticeable crease/line in my neck. Somewhere along the way, I discovered this neck line and have using various creams and such to blend in back into my skin ever since. I&#x27;ve used the Bee Venom Mask for a few weeks now, applying it at night before I go to sleep, then again in the morning after my shower. It has strong fragrance that I can&#x27;t quite describe. It&#x27;s not exactly what I&#x27;d call a floral scent, but more of a clean soap smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When applying it to my neck, it does seem to have a tingling/warming feeling that starts up a few minutes after application. My neck feels ever so slightly warm, almost as though it&#x27;s about to feel irritated, but then doesn&#x27;t. This reminds me of some lip treatments/glosses I&#x27;ve used that were meant to be plumping. After applying them, they start to single a bit, causing circulation to increase and the lips to get a little fuller appearance. This feeling of this Bee Venom Mask reminds me of these and seems to have similar effects. Over time it seems the mask causes fullness of the skin, and starts to fill in the lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is thick and in the ingredients it&#x27;s mentioned that it contains Shea Butter (which I love). It comes packaged in a weighty frosted glass jar, with a shiny gold screw-top lid. It&#x27;s a nice looking jar, that can sit on your bathroom counter top without screaming &amp;#34;wrinkle cream&amp;#34; to any guests who may use the restroom. It&#x27;s packaged like a high end facial cream. Just be certain the first time you use it, to try it out before you have to go out. Since there is bee venom in it, you&#x27;ll want to test it out and check to see that if the venom causes any irritation of your skin before putting it on and heading out the door. That way if you find it causes any temporary irritation of your skin, you&#x27;ll know ahead of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample of the product was provided for reviewing purposes.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for only a couple weeks and can already see a noticeable difference in my skin! It&#x27;s more even and the lines on my face are minimizing right before my eyes! They jar is a generous amount that will last you a long time! I would highly recommend this to anyone- whether it&#x27;s for prevention or to help minimize lines and wrinkles that have already surfaced.</li>
            <li> I wonder if this product really works for my age being thirty with acne prone sensitive skin?</li>
            <li> When I asked my husband if he could see a difference in my Beenigma-tized skin , he answered, in his dodge-ball way, \\&quot;It doesn&#x27;t matter how you look, but how you feel.\\&quot; At first, I scoffed at him. After some thought, however, I realized that he was right in a way: I know my face and skin best. If I felt that it had changed for the better, then it probably had, even if the results were not dramatic. After all, did I really expect to look ten years younger after using this product? No. I had merely hoped for improvement. Still, just to be certain that I wasn&#x27;t falling for the placebo effect, I took before, during, and two-weeks-in photographs using the same, lip-parted, smile-less, and, yes, unflattering shot after washing my face in the morning. I zoomed in on each to see if there had been changes. And there WERE differences -- not in the deeper wrinkles but in the overall texture of my skin. My face looked slightly (not a lot) smoother and tighter, whether because of the bee toxin or because of the effects of the honey cream. Although I don&#x27;t look younger, I like what this product did to my skin. So, yes, I feel that Bee Nigma had an effect, albeit a subtle one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before beginning, I tested Bee Nigma on the underside of my forearm. About thirty seconds later, my arm actually felt as though it was being stung, and that sensation lasted for about five minutes. I was shocked. I was naturally nervous about applying it to my face, even though my arm had no redness or other effects beyond the initial stinging. The next day, I took the chance: no stinging sensation! Over the next week, I experienced the occasional tingling -- the kind you&#x27;d get from an astringent -- and a few quick stabs near my temple, but nothing unpleasant enough to make me stop. During the second week, I felt no sensations at all after I applied it. I don&#x27;t know whether my body simply got used to the toxins or if they are unevenly distributed in the cream. I highly recommend doing a patch test first to check for sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I washed off the mask after thirty minutes, but I discovered that it had the best effect when I applied it as a night cream and left it on overnight. The honey and emollients were enough to moisturize my skin, and I didn&#x27;t have to worry about applying sunscreen over it. I switched from short-term, twice a day application to long-term, once a day application, making a single jar last longer with better results on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The label says prominently that Beenigma is produced in New Zealand, although the small print on the back says that it is distributed by a Gauteng, South African company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though bee venom has been described as the \\&quot;poor man&#x27;s Botox,\\&quot; you will not get Botox-like paralysis from this product. I consider that a good thing. The biggest question for consumers is cost: Are subtle effects worth the price? Since no cream offers eye-popping results, I&#x27;d say yes, if you are inclined to using high-end creams to improve elasticity and general tone. Don&#x27;t buy this if you expect dramatic results; in that case, your best bet would be a respected plastic surgeon. Beenigma won&#x27;t work on deep wrinkles, and it won&#x27;t \\&quot;lift\\&quot; your face. All I have to do is run my hands down my face to *feel* my softer skin, even if my husband cannot see it.

            <li> I&#x27;m a middle aged mom whose beauty routine consists of washing my face with a bar of soap when I shower and maybe remembering to put some drug store cream on my face before bed. I am careful about sun exposure and always wear my sunscreen, but age and gravity are starting to show in the wrinkles and eye bags on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention that I don&#x27;t spend money on myself? I can&#x27;t see spending money on beauty products when we have so many other expenses and obligations. So I was delighted to receive a sample of Beenigma directly from the manufacturer in exchange for an honest review - I would have never bought this for myself, especially when almost every anti-aging product out there is snake oil. The bee venom in Beenigma is supposed to stimulate the skin into producing collagen and elastin - two proteins our young faces produce but our older faces lack. I was skeptical, but willing to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using Beenigma several weeks ago, and as I saw the improvements day by day I started researching, reading reviews and having to admit that this bee venom thing really does work. I am a convert!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream gives my face a very slight tingle (but no redness) when I apply it, and soaks in quickly without leaving my face feeling greasy at all. It smells like the manuka honey it contains, which is a nice, natural scent and not overpowering at all. I use it twice a day, massaging it sparingly on cheeks, forehead, neck and around my mouth. I use a little more of it around my eyes, where I have the most signs of aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In two weeks, I&#x27;ve seen my skin texture improve more than with any drug store moisturizer I&#x27;ve used. My neck is less crepey, my face is more plumped and youthful looking, and definitely my eye bags and crows feet are less noticeable. Even my husband says he can tell that my face looks smoother and younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say the improvement is cumulative, so I&#x27;ll continue using this cream and update my review as time goes by. But as of this writing, I am very impressed with Beenigma and all those bees who contributed to it.time goes by. But as of this writing, I am very impressed with Beenigma and all those bees who contributed to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Bee Nigma facial cream for about two weeks now. I know that it&#x27;s called a mask, but to me a mask is meant to be washed off. This cream feels so good on my face, I certainly would not wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging: It comes beautifully packaged in a lovely jar and attractive box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consistency: The cream is thick and creamy, so just a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance: I was surprised to read in a few reviews that some people didn&#x27;t like the fragrance, because I really love it. I think it has a soft, almost baby powder like smell. It&#x27;s very mild though and dissipates quickly, so if you don&#x27;t care for it for some reason, the smell doesn&#x27;t last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the skin: The cream feels light and smooth as it goes on and is easy to spread on the face and neck. I haven&#x27;t experienced any tingling at all. It remains on the skin surface feeling moist for a few minutes, then it absorbs quickly into the skin. It never feels oily or sticky. I&#x27;ve thrown out perfectly good jars of face cream that left an oily or sticky feeling on my face, but this product does neither. Hours later my skin still has a soft, velvety feel to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noticeable changes: I&#x27;ve noticed that my facial skin has a smoother texture, and the fine lines around my mouth have plumped up a bit. The pores around my nose seem to have reduced in size, and that makes my skin tone even out. The biggest improvement that I&#x27;ve noticed is that my recent onset of \\&quot;adult\\&quot; acne (I&#x27;m almost 60) has cleared up. I&#x27;ve been battling acne in the nose area and around my nostrils for almost a year, and it has completely cleared up in the past couple of weeks. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a coincidence or not, but I plan to keep using Bee Nigma and see if it stays away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer provided a sample for review.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time coming up with a review title that didn&#x27;t sound like an infomercial. But really, after using this for just about a month now, I can honestly say that my skin looks amazing. I&#x27;ll start with the knowledge that my skin is usually pretty good. I don&#x27;t smoke, I don&#x27;t spend a ton of time at the beach or in the sun (although I did in my younger years), I don&#x27;t use foundation or other heavy makeup either. But as I entered into my 49th year, I was gifted with my first brown age spot, right in the middle of my cheek. Every time I looked in the mirror, it stared back and me and said, &amp;#34;Face reality, you are getting older.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I was not going to give in. I am not a vain person but this age spot was driving me nuts as well as some of the face creases and thin lines. I was offered a chance to test out the Bee Venom Cream Mask to provide an honest review. As a skeptic, I was pretty critical in my expectations, especially for something with a price tag of more than 4 times what I usually spend on face cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I followed the instructions. I was wary at first, expecting a red face, some kind of reaction, tingling or something that would bring the reality home that this cream contains bee venom. But all I got was a very short lived slight redness and the amazing results of the product. My dark spot is now very faded -- almost gone. I watched it disappear mostly over the first two weeks of use. It hasn&#x27;t completely gone away but it is still getting lighter. Any fine lines I had around my eyes are gone and some of my cheek creases are gone or greatly diminished. I also have some deep &#x27;between the eyebrow&#x27; creases from squinting (or frowning...) for many, many years. Since these go much deeper than the skin layers they have not gone away but I didn&#x27;t expect them to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has a lovely scent, a creamy honey smell that lingers for a bit but never bothered me. The cream disappears quickly and really seems to hydrate without leaving any greasy feel. What little make-up I wear did not smear or smudge any more because of this cream. After using this for a month, I still have a little more than half the jar left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that even though this jar was provided for me to test out, I would be happy to purchase new jars to continue the benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went from skeptic to believer in a month.leaving any greasy feel.

            <li> When I asked my 60-year-old wife if she was interested in trying Beenigma, she was skeptical to say the least. Because of hormonal problems when she was much younger, she has a number of facial scars from acne and other skin ailments. She&#x27;s tried Mederna and countless other facial creams, but they were either too harsh, too drying, or largely ineffective. But after reading about Beenigma on the company&#x27;s website, she agreed to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the first day, she tried rubbing in a little Beenigma on a part of the left side of her face as a test. After four days of this, she said there was a noticeable improvement in her \\&quot;smile line\\&quot; and acne scars. Her skin was more supple, the lines were not as deep, and the old acne scars were less pronounced. She also said that her skin pores appeared to be smaller, but without the excessive drying that other products had produced. On the fifth day, she began applying Beenigma on her entire face and her neck. Now, after about ten days of using Beenigma twice a day, she is very pleased with the results. They&#x27;re noticeable, too - even I can see and feel the smoothing effects on her skin, and the acne scars that she hated are not as prominent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife said that the first couple of times, she felt a mild tingling, presumably from the bee venom in Beenigma, but after that, she didn&#x27;t notice it anymore. She added that a little bit goes a long way, but she informed me that we will be purchasing another jar when this one runs out. That&#x27;s okay with me. During our thirty years of marriage, I&#x27;ve seen thousands of dollars worth of cosmetics come into our bathroom, and most of them got tossed out eventually to make room for a new crop of creams and lotions that promised to be the Fountain of Youth (they weren&#x27;t). Beenigma isn&#x27;t the Fountain of Youth either, but the results have been so promising that my wife is very happy about it, and that makes me very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re even slightly interested in the product, it&#x27;s worth a trip to the company&#x27;s website to learn how the bee venom and Manuka honey are believed to work in the skin. Also, it was fascinating to learn how the venom is extracted from bees without harming them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Update (July 30, 2013): After using Beenigma for three weeks, the brown moles and skin tags on my wife&#x27;s face and neck are much less prominent. I don&#x27;t know what mechanism is at work here, but apparently the bee venom stimulates growth of new skin cells or something like that.

            <li> I&#x27;ve been lucky enough to inherit my Dad&#x27;s skin and my Mom&#x27;s hair, so even though I am well into my 60&#x27;s I am just starting to get wrinkles and my hair is still the color it was when I was 16.  Still, there are those few tiny crow&#x27;s feet, a couple of lines across my forehead, and most annoyingly, those inherited lines at the corners of my mouth that give me a \\&quot;hang dog\\&quot; look, make me always seem sad.  I don&#x27;t like those, so I&#x27;ve been paying special attention to them with this [[ASIN:B00DD94A4W Beenigma Bee Venom Cream Mask]] from New Zealand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer sent me a sample to try several weeks ago.  The first time I used it I noticed just the tiniest of tingles but I&#x27;ve never experienced that again.  Rather than use this as a heavy mask, I&#x27;ve been applying it after cleaning my face every morning and night, paying special attention to those wrinkles at the corners of my mouth.  After allowing it to soak in for 20 minutes or so I apply my regular moisturizer over the top. (When you&#x27;re my age you need all the moisturizing you can get!)  The smell is gentle and not unpleasant and the cream leaves no greasy feel.  After about 3 weeks, I don&#x27;t really notice any \\&quot;permanent\\&quot; improvement of the sort you might expect from Botox, but there is a very obvious difference in those lines I hate so much, particularly for several hours after applying the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grandma&#x27;s $0.02 - While not quite Botox, [[ASIN:B00DD94A4W Beenigma Bee Venom Cream Mask]] seems to work quite well.</li>
            <li> After so many years of over-priced department store creams that promise it all but deliver little results, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from Beenigma. It does include Manuka honey, and I am aware that that is a great product, but bee venom? Who knew?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I am delighted to say this is a product that delivers. I have had an ugly bag under my eye from tearing up repeatedly over the death of a beloved cat. Nothing worked to reduce it until Beenigma. Now it is disappearing, and not slowly at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it less than two weeks and am thrilled with my results. Flabby neck is going away. Baggy eye is almost gone. I couldn&#x27;t ask for more. So, I&#x27;m delighted to recommend this face cream and plan to buy more when this is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How long will my results last? That has yet to be determined, but, for now, I&#x27;ll keep on using it twice a day. I&#x27;ve barely dented the contents of my jar, so I expect the jar to last for a couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try. This one works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer provided a sample for my review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a middle aged woman with the same complaints most women my age have - thinner, less elastic skin that shows signs of aging. I do not have sensitive skin and I am not allergic to bee stings or honey - both things you should be sure of before using this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is expensive and comes packaged appropriately - a lovely box and a beautiful jar. The cream is thick and very slightly waxy, but not unpleasantly so. It smells faintly of orange blossoms to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for about 3 weeks now in the following manner - I exfoliate my face, neck and decolletage with a Buff Puff and then apply a thin coat of Beenigma. I&#x27;ve been doing this twice daily. My skin tingles very slightly and feels wonderful. It doesn&#x27;t cause any redness and it makes a wonderful base for makeup to be applied over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also been applying it on the back of only one hand twice daily so that I could better judge the effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very hard to be objective when looking for signs of improvement twice daily during application, but I feel the thin skin under my eyes and on my neck feels and looks firmer and younger. It also seems to be having a brightening effect on my skin tone - blotches seem to be fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter, who lives in another city and didn&#x27;t know I&#x27;ve been using this, commented to me yesterday that I was looking wonderful! When I told her that I have been using this cream, she looked closely and said she definitely thinks there has been an improvement. When I showed her the backs of my hands and asked her to choose which hand looked better, she unhesitatingly chose the hand I&#x27;ve been using the cream on as looking much younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is some interesting science behind this cream. Manuka honey has been used for years in the treatment of skin wounds and to enhance the immune system when taken internally. Scientists are now studying it more closely because it seems to be working to treat antibiotic-resistant infections like MRSA because it inhibits the growth of bacteria! It&#x27;s remarkable stuff. Google it and you&#x27;ll find a lot of information. The Manuka honey in this cream is 20+.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bee venom is also very interesting. It&#x27;s also being studied because scientists discovered this year that bee venom actually kills the HIV virus! (Google this, too.) In other words, it&#x27;s powerful stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since both of these main ingredients fight infection and inflammation - things that accelerate aging when chronically present in the body - it&#x27;s not surprising to me that it can have a visible impact on aging skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beenigma is not a miracle or a fountain of youth, but my skin is noticeably improved since using it and it makes my face feel lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample of Beenigma for reviewing purposes, but no promise for a positive review was made or implied.ant infections like MRSA because it inhibits the growth of bacteria!

            <li> So I&#x27;m never one to fall for these \\&quot;beauty in a bottle\\&quot; gimmicks. Given that fact, I was very, very skeptical by this product. But after having tried it, I have to say that I actually like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, has it noticeably reduced my wrinkles? Probably not. Maybe softened a line here or there? It&#x27;s so hard to judge these things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I can say is that it has made my skin look and feel better. I have oily skin so after I wash it, I usually use some sort of cream to give moisture back to the parts that aren&#x27;t oily. This process, however, always leaves part of my skin looking really dried out. Since using this product, my skin no longer has that dried out look in some parts. It has made my skin more supple. It doesn&#x27;t feel dry anymore. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the bee venom or the honey they use in the product. Whatever it is, it&#x27;s making my skin look and feel better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I was wary of is because I have oily skin that is very sensitive, I was worried I&#x27;ll start breaking out if I use this product. Well, three and a half weeks later and not a single break out! So obviously, this can be used on all skin types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had also read the other reviews and was aware that some people thought it had a strong scent. I buy everything unscented because I just can&#x27;t stand these funky scents in everything. I have to say that the scent of this product, which is very slight, doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. It smells very slightly like honey. You can smell it as you&#x27;re putting it on but the scent vanishes within minutes, so no problems there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a very good product. It certainly agrees with my skin and makes it feel and look better which is ultimately all I care about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample was sent to me for review.</li>
            <li> When the manufacturer contacted me to do a review of Beenigma and thus generate some buzz about it, I was intrigued. Would this facial cream tingle when applied? Would I break out in giant red spots due to an allergy (at the time I was unsure about whether I was allergic to bees)? Would I single-handedly increase the flower and honey sales in Pierre? These are questions that I am sure inquiring minds wish to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the product description (as well as the literature contained with the product packaging), Beenigma takes advantage of New Zealand bee venom, Manuka honey, shea butter, and a few other chemical tongue-twisters in their facial lotion to smooth skin and eliminate wrinkles. I was a bit skeptical about the bee venom and the honey; fortunately when I stepped outside I wasn’t mauled by a bear. After avoiding ursine attacks, I sat down to give a robust trial on a product that is very much out of my price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application &amp; Texture&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beenigma comes in a small glass container and includes a plastic applicator (there is a small indentation at one end that is akin to a spoon). The smell is decidedly neutral: it does not smell fruity, flowery, or of chemicals, which is a plus. The cream is thick but easily applied; I used the stick to swipe streaks of cream under my eyes, across both cheeks, on the center of my forehead, and on my chin. Rubbing it in felt silky, with no greasy residue. Note that you can also use this cream as a mask; given the small size of the container and the cost of the product, I think that the conservative application is the best option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beenigma, as I mentioned above, is a great cream. I have used Oil of Olay before, and while it moisturizes and applies easily, there was always a lingering greasiness on my fingers and face. Conversely, the smooth coverage of the Beenigma cream was wonderful: a little swatch goes a long way, there is no strong odor, and I could snap my fingers with no issues. What does this mean? If your kids are bugging you while you are in the bathroom, you don’t have to wash your hands before you click away your disapproval! I had no idea that expensive facial creams could reduce wrinkles AND discipline unruly children!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Silliness aside, the biggest question that everyone has about Beenigma is, of course, the efficacy of the product. Spending this kind of money on a beauty treatment is a considerable investment. Here is my analysis:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The texture and application of this cream is definitely neater than other, cheaper creams. From the lack of a strong odor and how it is quickly absorbed by my skin are the least of the benefits gained when using Beenigma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Make sure that you are not allergic to bee and/or wasp venom. It could be the best cream in the world, but risking anaphylactic shock is not worth your beauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) There is no stinging, burn, tingle, or other sensation when applying this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) It does smooth your skin and help to make it tauter.&lt;br /&gt;Beenigma, in short, is an excellent beauty cream that definitely excels in making your face feel smoother, sexier, and confident. I followed the instructions on the bottle: after washing my face I used the cream once in the morning and once at night. With the dry heat from running the furnace, my skin dries out and sometimes cracks. With other products that I have used, I would have to reapply them every few hours. Beenigma, on the other hand, lasted a full twelve hours. Within two days, the cracks were gone completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are in the market for a high-quality beauty cream that does more than make your skin greasy, smell like a florist shop, and does more than layer chemicals onto your face with no noticeable improvement, Beenigma is a godsend. From the delicate fragrance to a cream that stays where you smear it without slowly dripping down your face, Beenigma will be theproduct that will bring you compliments. And, while you will not have any ursine men lusting after you, I wouldn’t be surprised if a human or two made a pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have the money to spare and want to see a noticeable change without having to use multiple products, this is for you. A little bit goes a long way and bringing out a youthful glow makes Beenigma worth its weight in gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Disclaimer: This product was sent to me by the manufacturer at no cost to review.

            <li> I was excited and thankful to be asked to review this cream. At my age, I definitely am thankful for any help I can get with my skin. The day I received it,  I put a small amount on my face to test for reactions, unfortunately I was not able to  use it. I did have a reaction, so be sure to test before applying.  Now what to do? .I found a solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister-in-law, who lives with us and is 60 years old, asked if she could try it and that would allow me to see how it worked on someone and be able to review it. I was happy about that. She also tested to make sure she had no reactions before we started, and didn&#x27;t. So the next day she applied it as directed. She told me that she did feel a little sting on her face, but nothing unbearable, and her face did get a tad red as well. However, nothing too bothersome, so we continued on.. She had some brown marks by her one eye that she was hoping this cream would take care of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; By the third day we could see a difference in her skin. The brown marks were almost gone, amazing!  I was surprised, and her face had lost that saggy look that all women of this age absolutely hate, but always get. By the end of the week there was a drastic difference in her skin, tone, texture all seemed like a much younger woman. No, not a twenty year old, but her skin looks healthy and vibrant.  Yes, I was jealous. Let me tell you, this cream works, plain and simple. We were very impressed. I did try to take  pictures of the entire process, but she said if I put pictures up she would sue me, hummm, so I decided not to.  I will try and put an update on here  and let you know how her face is doing, but for now I have one happy sister-in-law!  Definitely a product that works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a free bottle of Bee-Venom-Cream-Mask for an honest review.</li>
            <li> Bee Venom is a traditional remedy that has been rediscovered.  The trend got hot when this new \\&quot;natural Botox\\&quot; was adopted by Kate Middleton as part of her skin care regimen before her wedding to Prince William. Gwyneth Paltrow is another big fan who is singing its praises.  The question is: Does it really work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The short answer is Yes.  I tried a sample (which I received from the manufacturer in exchange for a fair and honest review).  It may not be The New Botox, but it&#x27;s one of the best topical skin care products I&#x27;ve tried and it does appear to minimize fine lines, skin discolorations and even some light scars.  It&#x27;s especially good around the eyes, where it also helps with minor puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using Beenigma Bee Venom Cream for a week, my skin is noticably smoother.  It may be the honey, which is not only an exceptional moisturizer, but also a natural antibacterial, so it fights inflammations, acne and infections. It also brightens the skin, gives it a nice healthy glow. This is probably from the venom, which is said to stimulate circulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anything that boosts circulation is a good thing. More nutrients and more oxygen mean that even older skin has what it needs to produce stronger cells and, most important, stronger and more limber collagen and elastin. These make up the tiny little connector fibers that hold your skin in place.  Like any elastic that is constantly stretched, after a while the collagen and elastin fibers get saggy and baggy -- and so does our skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bee venom is an excellent healer for damaged skin.  This is due to a high concentration of Mellitan, a very powerful anti-inflammatory, about 100 times more potent than hydrocortisone.  This means that if you have sensitve skin, lots of minor breakouts, or rough and scaly patches, Beenigma may be a big help.  It might even help alleviate rosacea and eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I especially like about Beenigma is that I can see a difference right away.  I use it in the morning and it makes my skin look healthy. The little wrinkles around my eyes look smoother.  It also plumps up my complexion, so my face looks tigher, more toned.  I don&#x27;t know if the effects are long term, but the cream, while expensive, costs a lot less than Botox which works extremely well on deep wrinkles caused by contracting muscles, but can&#x27;t help that quilted look that&#x27;s a sign of older skin. Botox also has no real therapeutic value. Beenigma does. On the other hand, Beenigma won&#x27;t erase those deep creases between the eybrows or on the forehead, or the Howdy Doody lines around the mouth. Only Botox or other fillers work on those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to Paltrow, it also erases minor scars, even older ones.  If it works on scars, it may also work on dark patches and sun damage.  Worth trying since even at $130 for a small jar, it&#x27;s less than the usual dermatological procedures needed to get rid of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had one concern about the bee venom ingredient. It was my understanding that a bee dies after stinging and i wondered if collecting the venom resulted in the death of the bee. I&#x27;m not a big bee fan and run when one gets close, but they are becoming scarce and are essential to life on our planet. Killing them off for a face cream seems a little over the top.  However, in checking out venom suppliers, it turns out that the method of collection doesn&#x27;t harm the bee. The bees are trained to eject venom against glass. They release venom when they feel threatened, and the beekeepers use different smells that trigger the response in their bees. The venom is collected from the glass and the bees go back to regular bee life until they are needed for another donation.  The process is painstaking: One gram of venom from New Zealand, a major producer, is the equivalent of 10,000 bee stings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Beenigma in the morning because I just like the way it makes my skin look after application. It makes a nice base for face make up.  I alsouse it at night after cleansing.  If I can see that it&#x27;s working, I&#x27;m happy.  Too many products boast about \\&quot;visible\\&quot; results that need a magnifying glass to see.  Beenigma won&#x27;t take ten years off your face, but it will make the face you have look a little smoother, a little healthier. It helps with puffy eyes (but not those under-eye bags...they&#x27;re usually filled with fat, not water and need to be treated surgically), makes your complexion glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the cream on my lips as well. Bee venom is often found in the better lip plumpers because it makes them lips look fuller and softens the vertical lines that make a face look tired and old, and that make lipstick &#x27;bleed.&#x27; For me, Beenigma is a very effective facial cream, well worth the $130 pricetag, especially since a little of the product goes a very long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you want an instant quick fix for your complexion, if you want your skin to look younger and healthier, your wrinkles to look less entrenched, you might want to considr Beenigma.

            <li> I have frown and forehead lines that are more more substantial than I would like. I have been applying Beenigma twice a day for about a month. Over this time frame, I have noticed an impact on the frown lines but not such a noticeable result on the forehead lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began using the product in November. I first applied the product under my chin to test for an allergic reaction. I experienced about day of itching, but I did not have any redness. The immediate feeling upon the first application was a slight tingling and a tightness. The itchiness set in after a few hours. I noticed that the product had a floral scent that seemed to linger for about twenty minutes. After not noticing any significant reaction, I proceeded to use the product the next day all over my face. I did not encounter the itchiness or the tingling from the first day. The sensation of tightness did come back, but it was not uncomfortable. Throughout the weeks, subsequent applications have led to a feeling of tightness, but this sensation is often brief - maybe ten minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In week three, I started to use St. Ives Blemish &amp; Blackhead Control Apricot Scrub, 6 oz in conjunction with this product and that is when I really started to begin noticing an impact on my skin. I only use the St. Ives product once a day, but once it was introduced, the frown lines began to diminish more rapidly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As noted, I have used this product for about a month. At approximately two uses per day, I have used about a third of a jar. I anticipate that this jar will take me through January. I do not use a lot of product. It spreads easily on the face and is absorbed easily as well. It does not leave an overly shiny or greasy appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the next step would be abstaining from the product for a period of time to see what impact there is. I&#x27;m curious to know: How quickly it would be before the deepness of my previous lines returns? Could the product be used once a day to maintain results? Is there a point when the product would just be a maintenance tool and no more improvement would be seen?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I think that this product has had an impact on my lines. It was a great day when I woke up and truly noticed some results taking place. I want to emphasize that it was not an overnight process. I have been fairly dedicated to applying this cream, and I think it could potentially work for others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a jar of Beenigma to test prior to posting this review.results?

            <li> Back in 2011 Dr. Oz did some segments about bee venom being used in a variety of beauty products, facial creams and masks being the big sellers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bee stings causes puffiness and swelling which in turn increases the collagen and reduces the fine lines and wrinkles on your skin. Besides helping fill in lines, bee venom also help maintain skin tone and color. When a bee stings you it is the active component \\&quot;Melittin\\&quot; that causes the localized pain and inflammation at the injected part of your body. Melittin can absorb toxins, but it also soaks in oxygen, amino acids and hormones that can give your skin a natural rejuvenation. That is what Beenigma does without the actual bee sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon the first application I did feel a slight tingle, but after continuous use that seems to fade away. The cream is thick and quickly absorbs into your skin. Since it is so dense, it does not glide on smoothly but it disappears quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beenigma can be used as either a cream or a mask. Use as a cream: Wash face and apply morning and night. The nourishing formulation will absorb into the skin. Avoid contact with the eyes. I made the mistake of touching my eyes after applying the cream and I will never do it again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use as a mask: Up to 3 times a week. Wash face and gently massage, a generous layer to your neck and face. Leave on for at least 20 minutes. Wipe off the extra layer with a towel or facial tissue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soap is a neutralizer to the bee venom and the two products should not be used together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 4 weeks of continuous use I have seen a tremendous improvement in my skins overall tone and color. My face glows, it is extremely soft and a majority of the lines lines are faint. It has not really help with my forehead lines which are the biggest wrinkled areas, but my smile, nose and crows feet have improved significantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I admit to wanting to try this out because it sounded so cool. If you give me the chance to safely rub bee venom all over my face, I&#x27;m going to take it--I&#x27;ve also drank liquor filled with scorpions and venomous snakes. I was pretty skeptical about the effectivity of this; almost every \\&quot;miracle ingredient\\&quot; turns out to be more mundane than magic. But I wanted to give it a shot just to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It surprisingly works pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bee venom works on the principle that bee stings stimulate collagen and elastin, which is what causes them to \\&quot;puff up\\&quot; after you have been stung. Rubbing just the right quantity of bee venom stimulates your skin and sort of \\&quot;exercises it\\&quot; to fill in the wrinkles with nice, fresh collagen and put a little more life back into your sagging flesh. Additional ingredients include manuka honey--which is also hailed as a skin-boosting wonder, the ubiquitous shea butter, some almond oil, and a menagerie of chemicals that have never seen the inside of a plant but still work darn good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both my wife and I tried out this Beenigma (Love that name!) cream mask together. It isn&#x27;t much of a \\&quot;mask,\\&quot; which implies to me some opaque treatment that you later wash off. Instead this is just a cream that you massage into your face, then wait for 20 minutes. The first application gives you a sting, which I thought was great. Nothing like a little physical sensation to show you that it is working. After using it for a couple of weeks the sting has gone away, or we have just gotten used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results from the Beenigma impressed both of us. My wife is Asian, and blessed with that kind of skin that makes her look 20 years younger than she actually is. Me, not so lucky--I inherited deep crow&#x27;s feet from my father, and all of my brothers have the kind of eyes you could run rivers through. I&#x27;ve been fighting against that with sunscreen and product and have so far maintained the fort. The Beenigma did wonders for the lines I have. Both my wife and I are very pleased with the results, and far less skeptical about the effectivity of bee venom. Sting away, bees!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback I can see to Beenigma is the price--at a hundred-plus dollars a bottle, this is an extreme luxury item. Sure it works, and it comes in a gift-quality bottle with nice presentation, but like all products of this kind its effects are temporary. In order to keep them up, you have to keep a steady supply of Beenigma in your bathroom. I suppose wealth is all relative--to some people a hundred dollars is not a big layout of cash. But we&#x27;re not so lucky and the price is prohibitive for us to keep up with Beenigma, no matter how effective it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product for review purposes.ave.

            <li> If I hadn&#x27;t seen it with my own eyes (and felt it, too . . .)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is beyond absolutely amazing!  It is a 5 star +++ product!  Many products claim fast results, but don&#x27;t really deliver as we hope.  We are all looking for a skin product that helps with \\&quot;seasoned\\&quot; skin (I don&#x27;t like the word \\&quot;aging\\&quot;).  And we want to see results fast.  Guess what?  Here is your product!  I have seen noticeable positive results OVERNIGHT!  YES!  You heard me right.  OVERNIGHT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the evening of November 11, I began using this product.  I used a gentle microdermabrasion cream on my face to clean away any dead skin cells so the cream could penetrate, followed by cleansing with a gentle plant-based cleanser.  Without drying my face, I applied a light coating of Bee Nigma, massaging it into my face and neck. (Don&#x27;t forget your neck.  It holds your face up.)  I did not remove the product, but kept it on as a face cream.  Within about an hour, I could feel noticeably softer facial skin.  On the morning of November 12, approximately 8 hours later, I rinsed my face with cold water/wash cloth and reapplied Bee Nigma.  About an hour later, I was driving to work and all of a sudden I could feel my face tightening.  My skin was in pretty good shape anyway, but the velvety softness this product added to my skin was incredible.  I have now been using the product for 10 days and I am loving it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the little things I have noticed:&lt;br /&gt;-- I keep touching my face because I cannot believe this new-found velvety softness, including the dry spot I always USED TO HAVE on the left side of my forehead. (GONE)&lt;br /&gt;-- I noticed how a washcloth GLIDES over my face.&lt;br /&gt;-- I noticed how my face retains its moisture now.&lt;br /&gt;-- I noticed how much more ALIVE my skin looks now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the product as a cream, before bedtime and upon waking.  I leave it on my skin.  If I want to apply another face cream over it, I do so, but you don&#x27;t need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bee Nigma comes in a glass jar, about 2 3/8 inches in diameter and about 2 1/16 inches high.  It is NOT one of those jars with a smaller jar inside like some products do to make you think you are getting more of a product.  There is a very slight smell, but it is a natural smell, NOT fragrance.  It is made in New Zealand, with the active ingredients (in this order) of New Zealand Bee Venom and Manuka Honey.  Some of the other general ingredients include shea butter, honey and almond oil.  You can use it as a face mask, leaving on for at least 20 minutes, or you can use as a face cream and leave it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bee Nigma&#x27;s website explains the use of the bees from New Zealand that are producing the Manuka Honey from the Manuka Plant, which grows in New Zealand (more about Manuka Honey follows).  The bee venom is said to provide proteins, peptides, amino acvids and key enzymes.  The shea butter soothes and replenishes the skin, while the almond oil is fast penetrating, highly moisturizing and nourishing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All honey is not the same.  Some kinds of honey may be 100 times more powerful than others.  Manuka Honey is said to provide numerous health benefits, including benefits to skin care.  It is said to provide vitamins, minerals, amino acids, anti-oxidant/anti-bacterial/anti-inflammatory properties.  Manuka is said to improve skin texture and vitality, while it is hydrating.  Manuka is said to be helpful in fighting zits and acne, provides glucose to white blood cells (our immune system warriors) while it destroys bacteria, helps to heal wounds while improving cellular regeneration, promotes collagen production, helps with burns, arthritis, and eczema.  To be considered potent enough to be therapeutic, Manuka honey needs a minimum rating of 10 UMF (Unique Manuka Factor - standard).  Bee Nigma states their Manuka Honey has a 20+ UMF rating, out of a possible 5 - 25 UMF rating standard developed by honey producers.  BTW--I have a jar of Manuka Honey and it tastes so good, you could easily use it as a spread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of you may think this product is a little pricey.  I believe it is worth every penny.  As a bonus, you may find you can save money on some of the other skin products you no longer need.  It also contains NO parabens.  (According to my research, parabens are considered dangerous to our health, even in small amounts, because they accumulate, with cumulative effects.  Many companies use parabens as a preservative, to give the product a longer shelf life.  Parabens are said to be much less expensive.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bee Nigma comes with 100% guarantee.  If you are not satisfied, the website claims you can return it within 60 days.  It also says it is a CUMULATIVE product, which means the longer you use it, the more benefits you suck up through your skin.  It also claims to be anti-aging, rejuvenitive, and lifts, plumps, and reduces fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Making Bee Nigma does not harm the hard-working little bees that generously provide the primary ingredients of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, BTW - I am not a 25 year old with skin that hasn&#x27;t had time to season.  My skin has been 42 years old for the last 22 years.  I am thrilled with this product and it has far exceeded my expectations!  And, when you see an unexplained bright light coming from across a dimly lit room, it is probably just the glow coming from someone&#x27;s skin--someone who is using BEE NIGMA!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that I am not a health care professional.  These are my opinions based on my personal experience and research.  Also note that if you are allergic to bee pollen or bee stings, you probably are unable to use this product and should consult your doctor before considering it.  As a matter of fact, the label says not to use it if you have a known bee allergy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so impressed by this product, that I took the extra time to provide you with some research and a lot of information.  If you try it, I believe you will be every bit as impressed as I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW - Although I received this product as a free sample for potential review, I thoroughly intend to purchase it when my sample runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1/19/2014-My full-sized jar has just about run out, so, it has lasted me a little over 2 months. I am still LOVING this product and what it continues to do for me :) and I already ordered another jar.s so good, you could easily use it as a spread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of you may think this product is a little pricey.  I believe it is worth every penny.  As a bonus, you may find you can save money on some of the other skin products you no longer need.  It also contains NO parabens.  (According to my research, parabens are considered dangerous to our health, even in small amounts, because they accumulate, with cumulative effects.  Many companies use parabens as a preservative, to give the product a longer shelf life.  Parabens are said to be much less expensive.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bee Nigma comes with 100% guarantee.  If you are not satisfied, the website claims you can return it within 60 days.  It also says it is a CUMULATIVE product, which means the longer you use it, the more benefits you suck up through your skin.  It also claims to be anti-aging, rejuvenitive, and lifts, plumps, and reduces fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Making Bee Nigma does not harm the hard-working little bees that generously provide the primary ingredients of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, BTW - I am not a 25 year old with skin that hasn&#x27;t had time to season.  My skin has been 42 years old for the last 22 years.  I am thrilled with this product and it has far exceeded my expectations!

            <li> I am just fooling myself but to be able to find another cream that will work one has to try and trying is what I do. Cream is too drying on skin and Bee Venom ingredient is somewhere in the bottom of the list of ingredients. Need I say more!! So I am making my way back to my department store creme. $700.00 ouch but they work what can we do. 😳</li>
