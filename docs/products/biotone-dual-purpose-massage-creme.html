            <li> This is the best !  Is very comfortable on the skin not sticky or oily!  Highly recommend this product and is a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My massage therapist used this product on me to relieve some soreness in my muscles from physical activity, and most importantly the skin condition on my torso.  The arnica and ivy mix in this massage creme really did wonders calming my specific aches from physical exercise, and my skin inflammation caused by an auto immune disorder.  I use it every night on my torso.</li>
            <li> Awesome creme . Works wonders after surgery!&lt;br /&gt;Arrived on schedule</li>
            <li> Great lotion that I can&#x27;t find locally. I&#x27;ll have to see if I like the larger size. Like the arnica in it.</li>
            <li> This massage creme is fabulous.  It has a long &amp;#34;work time&amp;#34;, is not greasy, and just an overall great creme.  It was recommended to me by my massage therapist and so thankful she did.  Definitely worth the price - you won&#x27;t regret this purchase!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  It doesn&#x27;t clog your pores or leave your skin feeling all greased up. It helps to really get into the sore muscles without using a lot of pressure because your fingers just slide over the skin. On a side note: due to headache allergies,  I am unable to be around many aromas. This product has a nice subtle smell.</li>
            <li> tis is a great size to use at home for personal use I only have a few clients on the side so it will last a long time I use this at work and I will never change cream I have tried a few but this cream is the best by far.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product!!!!!!! use it everyday for general and deep tissue massage!</li>
            <li> My massage therapist uses this cream and I had to buy my own supply to use every day!&lt;br /&gt;I love the way it makes my skin feel, especially during the dry, winter months!</li>
            <li> My Physical Therapist recommended this cream.  I have found it to be effective treating the neuropathy in my feet.  It contains Arnica and Ivy extracts, but is odorless.</li>
            <li> The Best massage cream that i have used.</li>
            <li> best massage cream !!!</li>
            <li> This massage cream has great consistency, not greasy. No heavy scent and absorbs evenly without a residue left on skin.</li>
            <li> I had major surgery in april and have a huge scar across my belly from the incision.  i&#x27;m not in physical therapy and the the physical therapist recommended it to help with my scar as it&#x27;s what they use and it&#x27;s very inexpensive compared to the scar creams that are overpriced and don&#x27;t work that good.  definitely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion to work with. It hydrates skin &amp; carries well and doesnt leave my massage clients feeling greasy. Really does glide like an oil with the feel of a lotion. Great stufff for professional or personal massage.</li>
            <li> Love this massage cream. It is the best.</li>
            <li> My 95 y.o. mother has back problems and gets nightly messages to reduce the pain--she loves this, It  It has arnica as the top ingredient and her occupational therapist says that it the best topical arthritis pain reliever,</li>
            <li> Perfect for sensual or therapeutic massage!</li>
            <li> Love this. Used in P T where I went</li>
            <li> Bought because I have very dry skin.  Works great as a creme.  Soaks in well and stays.  Has no odor.</li>
            <li> Nice consistency and easy to use. The product is not greasy and doesn&#x27;t stain the sheets.&lt;br /&gt;Has a nice glide and feel to it.</li>
            <li> The arnica and ivy really does condition and lift sagging skin and smells fresh. I saw the transformation of my decolletage and know for sure it works!</li>
            <li> The crème soaks in completely after a period of time, allowing the massage to work on the muscle without friction. No sticking!</li>
            <li> Great for massage, no oil on sheets.</li>
            <li> As a massage therapist, my clients love this creme.</li>
            <li> Smooths out easily and makes massage enjoyable and refreshing. Love this product plus the arnica also helps with any discomfort.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years, in my opinion is the best massage product I have used. Not greasy, smells great, all my clients love it.</li>
            <li> I had my first professional massage.. and got interested in doing better so went to amazon sorted by customer review, and it paid off again.  This stuff is awesome.. just as described, it&#x27;s sort of just like a nice body lotion, except it lubricates like an oil without being oily.  Will surely never run out of this stuff.. great product!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!  I had a total knee replacement and my physical therapist used this creme for my deep tissue massage.  I felt so good after my PT that I decided to see if I could purchase it for myself.  I use this cream on my scar and knee every day at least 20 or more times a day.  It has helped with pain and also with the scar.  I gave some to a friend of the family and also to my son and daughter-in-law.  The both loved it also.  I have ordered a jar for my son and daughter-in-law for them to use.  I have praised this creme to a lot of people.  WONDERFUL STUFF THAT WORKS!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used this for years on aching muscles, sprains and tender spots...works like a champ!!</li>
            <li> I am allergic to olive oil and my wife is allergic to soy, so this was a wonderful discovery. It soaks in well, is not greasy and really nourishes the skim, while being a great message medium.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. I use it as my nightly cream all over my body before bed. I wake up to smooth, healthy skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a LMT and I use Biotone products ONLY!&lt;br /&gt;This is the lowest price for this product I have found!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> Best product ever. Not greasy, easy to work with.&lt;br /&gt;Even my boyfriend likes it the most, even though he does not like creams.</li>
            <li> Luxuriously deliciously awesome! I love how soft it makes my skin feel.</li>
