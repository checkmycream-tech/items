            <li> Beautiful wig, but the cap was just too small for my Gina Waters sized head :(</li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> I have had it for a long while, and its never let me down.</li>
            <li> This is my first wig from Motown Tress and I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> I also do hair but cant anymore due to this pregnancy.  </li>
            <li> I have ordered the jet black and the off black.</li>

            <li> I like the wig I may cut the sides down a little</li>
            <li> I will probably not purchase another Motown Tress Wig because of that little malfunction.</li>
            <li> the only thing she was a little disappointed about was the bangs need thinning which I saw in the reviews so not a big deal</li>
            <li> The wigs I usually buy when I&#x27;m trying to make ends meet are freetress wigs..</li>
            <li> My forehead is kinda small</li>
            <li> I was thinking of cutting the bangs a little because I don&#x27;t like a lot of hair in my face.</li>
            <li> The front is too thick...looks like a bad toupee.</li>
            <li> Very Disappointed!!!</li>

            <li> I wanted to like this wig but I never got a chance to. I tried it on once and I took it off lo and behold the strap broke... I just got it! Idk.. I&#x27;m sure it was just a malfunction and it probably won&#x27;t happen to you if you purchase... Just my luck I was planning on wearing this for the holidays because I couldn&#x27;t get in with my hairdresser.. As far as the style... It is a cute wig. Before the strap broke on me I was thinking of cutting the bangs a little because I don&#x27;t like a lot of hair in my face. There are no combs in this unit which is fine with me since I do not like combs because they pull and get tangled in my own hair. This wig did not look that cute on me lol like it did on some of the other people I&#x27;ve seen with this wig via youtube. I&#x27;m guessing because this hairstyle might not go with my face shape? Idk... I would recommend looking this wig up on youtube and seeing how it looks on others... When I saw how good it looked on them I had to purchase it.. However, it wasn&#x27;t that \\&quot;hot\\&quot; as what I thought it was going to be on me per say. The cool thing is that it&#x27;s real hair which I love because you can dye it, curl it, flat iron it... Whatever. This wig looked believable to me... I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t since it&#x27;s not lace but to my surprise it looks like my real hair. I was going to flat iron her until the strap broke.. Im so pissed. This is my first wig from Motown Tress and I am not impressed. I will probably not purchase another Motown Tress Wig because of that little malfunction. The wigs I usually buy when I&#x27;m trying to make ends meet are freetress wigs.. They are pretty darn sturdy hold up extremely well for the price. Cute wig if you have like a big forehead I think... Most people in those youtube videos have big foreheads so it looks good on them.. My forehead is kinda small so.. Im guessing that&#x27;s why it did not look good on me ; ( as far as the shipping the wig came a day before the estimated delivery date... That made me happy- however the shipper makes you sign before you can receive the package and lol I don&#x27;t like that bc... I was relaxing in bed + enjoying being able to sleep in and I get a knock on the door.. lol.. I&#x27;d much rather just have them leave it on my porch.  I had to run to the door in almost nothing because the mail guy was about to leave... And I wasn&#x27;t about to wait another day to give my wig.shipper makes you sign before you can receive the package and lol I don&#x27;t like that bc...

            <li> I love this wig. I&#x27;ve received so many compliments when I wear this hair.</li>
            <li> I love my new hair!!! This is by far the absolute best wig I have ever owned. I love changing hair styles frequently, but I think this is going to be my protective and classy style to last me throughout the rest of the year. I&#x27;ve already ordered my second one. No color needed. And I will probably order more. This is a well-made wig. No issues with it at all. Lots of compliments from people male and female. I would recommend to ANYONE!!!! This is a one-of-a-kind wig of mine! Lol. Thanks H. Volta!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I added a photo for you to see how natural it looks!!! I&#x27;ve ordered so many since my 1st review, I lost count lol!</li>
            <li> Sleek and stylush.  I live it.I am thinking about ordetingit in more colors.  Its really cute.  Good buy. Try it.</li>
            <li> It was not the same wig I have ordered elsewhere. It had to much shine and looked like synthetic. The texture was not like the wig I am wearing now. The wig I am wearing now is more like african american hair after being straighten.I have had several wigs by this company and this is not the same.</li>
            <li> I love my H. Volta Jet Black Human Hair Wig. This wig offers a sleek look at a reasonable price. Adding this piece to my collection has provided me with an easy out the door in no time mindset. You don&#x27;t have to shape up the wig at all. It comes fully contoured with a character of its own.</li>
            <li> Does not look like the picture. The front is too thick...looks like a bad toupee. I had to take it to a salon and get the front and sides thinned out. Then it looked better than the picture.</li>
            <li> love it love it it makes for a great do in seconds when I&#x27;m in between my hair salon visits or bad hair days</li>
            <li> It looks so natural that I&#x27;ve been told it looks like my real hair. I don&#x27;t have to fuss with curling my hair after a sweaty work-out. The only problem I have is with it riding up in the back.</li>
            <li> I bought this wig for my mother everything is good she loves it the only thing she was a little disappointed about was the bangs need thinning which I saw in the reviews so not a big deal</li>
            <li> Thinned out compared to the first one but in a good way. Love this style. Super cute!!</li>
            <li> Love love love I have 1 of considering buying another. 1..I get so many compliments ..This was my first wig purchase ever and I made a good decision for my first wig will be ordering again</li>
            <li> This wig is exactly as it appears on the model in the photograph.  I love this wig it&#x27;s adjustable and fashionalble.  I was very worried that this wig would make me look like a &amp;#34;grandmother&amp;#34; but I must say I&#x27;m impressed and I will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> Love love love this wig!!!&lt;br /&gt; Nice texture doesn&#x27;t irritate the scalp or forehead..  Thanks</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful wig. I absolutely love it!! Very manageable and styleable. As expected. I love Motown wigs anyway, but this one is really lovely.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful &amp; long lasting wig...</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my mom. She loved it. hers was older and she has had it a while. I decided she needed something newer, but she didn&#x27;t want to go to the store shopping, so i ordered this. She styled it a bit but she wore it straight out the box for a while so it works either way.</li>
            <li> Love it fit just fine esp for a quick change to a short style.</li>
            <li> I got this wig for my mom and she love it, she wears it most of the time and gets a lot of compliments.&lt;br /&gt;Her friends want it to.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best wigs I have ever own.  It feel and looks so natural.  Great buy, I would recommend this to anyone, and will purchase this again in the future!</li>
            <li> this wig is cute and stylish and very easy to manage. I have recieved lots of compliments and it frames my face very nicely.</li>
            <li> I like the wig I may cut the sides down a little but overall I like it.</li>
            <li> When I took it out of the package I knew it wasn&#x27;t going to be pretty. It was mishappen and it had really short sprigs of hair sticking up at the very top and one of the tracks in the back was torn. I tried it on anyway thinking I might love it enough to fix it and keep it but that was a mistake. Maybe if it were in better condition when I recieved it, I could have worked with it. The texture however, was very nice. It looked and felt like relaxed African American hair.</li>
            <li> Love this wig... I have had it for a long while, and its never let me down. A coworker admired it so much, that she insisted I buy her one.. which I did (but decided to keep it for future back-upüòä ). All in all, you won&#x27;t regret buying this wig, its very classy without too much fuss‚ÄºÔ∏è</li>
            <li> This wig is so adorable! I&#x27;m in love with it! I thought it was going to be too short for my taste but I tried it anyway and I&#x27;m so glad I did! It looks awesome on.</li>
            <li> I love it!  Im 14 weeks pregnant with TWINS and have a 2 year old daughter.  Im high risk and always dizzy or bout to pass out and I have a blood clot. I also do hair but cant anymore due to this pregnancy.  I always loved wigs and I thankful for Amazon saved my life I cant get up to get a ride and its a blessing to order off line I give it 10 star bc I love the way it looks on me it is so sexy buy it</li>
            <li> Very Disappointed!!! Brushed the hair and strands of hair was coming out in the come!!! Never again !!!</li>

            <li> Beautiful wig, but the cap was just too small for my Gina Waters sized head :(</li>
            <li> I order this product for my girlfriend who lives oversea and in less than 2 days I received it.&lt;br /&gt;I would like to thank the merchant for taking care of my order in a short period of time</li>
