            <li>And it smells awesome!</li>
            <li>This smells great coming out of the bottle but an hour or so after bath time, my baby&#x27;s hair smells musty.</li>
            <li>Great body wash as well.</li>

            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I did</li>
            <li>I thought maybe he needed a more moisturizing product</li>
            <li>I had tried many brands and never came across one</li>
            <li>I love all of the Earth</li>
            <li>I love lavender anything.</li>
            <li>I gave it 3 stars because I still feel it&#x27;s a safe product.</li>
            <li>Love all earth mama products.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and my daughter loves it too.</li>

            <li>I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love Earth Mama Angel Baby.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways, love this soap and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>I love everything about this product.  </li>
            <li>It also suds better in the bath for bubbles.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells good and is also very gentle.  </li>
            <li>It is great for those who are reducing chemicals in their life or are sensitive.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, lathers up so nicely, and my kiddo&#x27;s hair feels soft as ever.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Washes away easily.</li>
            <li>me, until this point, I always equated baby shampoo &#x3D; tear free formula.</li>
            <li>It dosen&#x27;t take much and lathers nicely.</li>
            <li>Mama Angel Baby products and was excited to try this one.</li>
            <li>Smells great and the smell lingers in the hair for a long time- not overpowering tho.  </li>
            <li>It smells very clean and the light lavender scent is very relaxing for both you and baby during bathtub.</li>
            <li>I was pregnant and I will continue to do so afterwards, the fact that it is chemical free makes the cost worth it.</li>
            <li>And leave baby smelling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>super well.  </li>
            <li>I say this to let you know that EMAB is the more gently and pure product out there.  </li>
            <li>The soaps are so gentle for baby and the smells are soooo fantastic.</li>
            <li>Soo natural and safe for my family.</li>
            <li>I have to use many pumps just to get a baby clean, but then doesn&#x27;t really feel clean since it feels so dry after a wash</li>
            <li>I massaged it very gently and then rinsed.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle soap.</li>
            <li>My two-year-old granddaughter thinks it&#x27;s absolutely hoot to use a foaming bath soap!</li>
            <li>I am in my 3rd bottle and love it</li>
            <li>think it&#x27;s funny people are upset that it will sting your eyes.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the ewg.org, which is where I learned about the product to begin with!</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: At 2.5 years, my son now doesn&#x27;t like this soap as he&#x27;s now aware that it stings his eyes.</li>
            <li>I even tried it out first</li>
            <li>Some probably love it, but it was a little strong for my preference.</li>
            <li>that wasn&#x27;t tear free.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, fun because of the foaming (but useless, because I can&#x27;t give this to her to play yet), really nice smell, and probably cleans really well like any castille soap does, but how can you make a baby shampoo that isn&#x27;t tear free?!?!</li>
            <li>We loved this and when it ran out we bought the much larger bottle of the same thing.  </li>
            <li>My baby&#x27;s skin is very delicate and I&#x27;m still to see if this soap will help , but it does not smell good at all and doesn&#x27;t feel like my baby is clean</li>
            <li>It does wash away w/ a splash of water; not sure if its a good thing?</li>
            <li>Gentle scent and leaves her so soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>It comes out if a foam - which is nice and helps you use less.</li>
            <li>The way I do this is, instead of rinsing with splashing water when cleaning her hair, I  like to use a wet wash cloth to wipe off  the soap since I get more control that way.</li>
            <li>Smells very...</li>
            <li>and this is so gentle and leaves the softest scent-</li>
            <li>I would prefer that over the straight lavender - even with the dispenser issues.</li>
            <li>I thought would be gentle</li>
            <li>(after hearing my baby cry in pain, I tried several different products in my own eyes and CB truly does not burn at all)</li>
            <li>I love the fact that their is people concerned enough about making a natural product out there.</li>
            <li>I love that it is scented with essential oils and I can completely trust that I&#x27;m not putting anything harmful onto my babys skin.</li>
            <li>(the bottle is not heavy enough, so it falls over if you push on the top one-handed, which is an issue if you are holding a baby)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to dispense and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>&amp; it doesn&#x27;t make my baby&#x27;s hair feel soft at all, more dry feeling to it.</li>
            <li>I love how there is no synthetic fragrance, only organic essential oils...</li>
            <li>I have been very concerned about the chemicals in many of our everyday products.</li>
            <li>I spent HOURS researching products before I had my son and I landed on EMAB because it is pure and clean of chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Pure, natural and smells like a spa.</li>
            <li>Hair is soft and it is gentle.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using this shampoo/body wash since we brought our baby girl home from the hospital and every time we bathe our daughter, the scent of this just reminds us of our sweet little baby and her first months home.</li>
            <li>I still have some left in my first bottle</li>
            <li>The scent is not strong but it&#x27;s just enough to make you feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Organic and natural -</li>
            <li>I really wish I had gone through the reviews, or read the back before using this.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Also, once it was gone (it lasted a pretty long time too), we removed the label and now use as a foaming soap dispenser in the kids bathroom.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I use this particular bottle (lavender) for myself in the shower.</li>
            <li>For most of that time we used the unscented variety and have been using the Lavender Vanilla for the past several months, which we prefer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the ingredient list but because it burned my sweet little angel&#x27;s eyes, we stopped using it as a shampoo.  </li>
            <li>More than half of the bottle is empty.</li>
            <li>The suds issue is only a problem now that my son is old enough to want &amp;#34;bubbles&amp;#34; in his bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the bottle clearly warns that it is NOT a no-tears formula, my son has never complained of soap in his eyes and we use this as soap and shampoo for him.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been using it daily for my 5 month old.</li>
            <li>w/ your bare hands.</li>
            <li>He is almost 4 months old and this one bottle is still almost half full, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I always try to buy chemical-free, safer products for my little ones.&lt;br /&gt;Comes out as a foam, doesn&#x27;t really suds</li>

            <li> I always try to buy chemical-free, safer products for my little ones.&lt;br /&gt;Comes out as a foam, doesn&#x27;t really suds</li>
            <li> It will last for a long time and won&#x27;t hurt my children.</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling sticky and dry.</li>
            <li> And the stinging doesn&#x27;t stop for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;To</li>
            <li> It leaves his skin soft and not over dried.</li>
            <li> Since this is castile, you have to be a little careful not to get the soap near the baby&#x27;s eyes...</li>
            <li> and it does make your skin feel so dry afterwards.</li>
            <li> I generally use 4-6 pumps per bathing as a minimum and a single bottle lasts us for a few months with ~3 bathings per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I really don&#x27;t like the rubbery texture of the skin that Castile soap leaves behind.</li>
            <li> Performance is not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Every natural brand of baby soap is not sting-free, because those ingredients are not good for your babies eyes or body.</li>
            <li> I know it warns about this on the label but what small child cooperates all the time and keeps their head back?  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s extremely drying to the skin</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars because occasionally the push-dispenser is hard to push down to get soap.</li>

            <li> Organic and natural - no worries about what is going on AND in your baby&#x27;s skin.  Also use it to make homemade baby wipe solution.  One bottle lasts us 5 months!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. My two-year-old granddaughter thinks it&#x27;s absolutely hoot to use a foaming bath soap! This product has a wonderful light scent and is fun for her to use</li>
            <li> Oh.my.gosh...does this smells heavenly!! We&#x27;ve been using this shampoo/body wash since we brought our baby girl home from the hospital and every time we bathe our daughter, the scent of this just reminds us of our sweet little baby and her first months home. I love how there is no synthetic fragrance, only organic essential oils...the lavender and vanilla is so relaxing and calming. Since this is castile, you have to be a little careful not to get the soap near the baby&#x27;s eyes...The way I do this is, instead of rinsing with splashing water when cleaning her hair, I  like to use a wet wash cloth to wipe off  the soap since I get more control that way. When washing her face and eyes, I just use the bath water that has a very small amount of soap in it. This is definitely a must buy! Earth Mama Angel Baby never disappoints! :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this soap after seeing it was well ranked by the EWG. It is great for those who are reducing chemicals in their life or are sensitive. It takes some getting used to, as it doesn&#x27;t lather well. Also, since it doesn&#x27;t have the chemical in it(as others do) that numbs the eyes, it will burn the eyes if it gets in them. I haven&#x27;t had this issues though. I am in my 3rd bottle and love it</li>
            <li> This stuff smells good and is also very gentle.  I use it for my toddler but also sometimes for myself.</li>
            <li> The lavender scent is calming, especially for baths before bedtime.  It&#x27;s easy to dispense and lasts a long time.  I still have some left in my first bottle and I&#x27;ve been using it daily for my 5 month old.</li>
            <li> I love all Earth Mama products.  I had the Orange/Vanilla body wash but wanted a lavender one too for flaming nighttime baths.  I love it.  Gentle scent and leaves her so soft and clean.  Hair is soft and it is gentle.  Very happY!</li>
            <li> We LOVE our Earth Mama!  I spent HOURS researching products before I had my son and I landed on EMAB because it is pure and clean of chemicals.  I&#x27;m glad that I did and here is why...  I was told, by a friend, to use Aveeno.  After 4 months, my son had an issue with his head getting flaky.  I thought maybe he needed a more moisturizing product so I pulled out a bottle of Aveeno and used it specifically on his scalp to wash his head.  I massaged it very gently and then rinsed.  The next morning, he had blisters on his poor little head.  I say this to let you know that EMAB is the more gently and pure product out there.  I will never use anything else again.</li>
            <li> I really wish I had gone through the reviews, or read the back before using this. I had been using it for 2 days, wondering why my daughter kept crying the bath, before figuring out that this is made of castille soap, and therefore hurts like a B when it gets in your eyes. And the stinging doesn&#x27;t stop for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;To me, until this point, I always equated baby shampoo &#x3D; tear free formula. I had tried many brands and never came across one that wasn&#x27;t tear free.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, fun because of the foaming (but useless, because I can&#x27;t give this to her to play yet), really nice smell, and probably cleans really well like any castille soap does, but how can you make a baby shampoo that isn&#x27;t tear free?!?!</li>
            <li> I love all of the Earth Mama Angel Baby products and was excited to try this one. I love lavender anything. This smells great coming out of the bottle but an hour or so after bath time, my baby&#x27;s hair smells musty. The scent lasts a day. Disappointed in this product. I gave it 3 stars because I still feel it&#x27;s a safe product.</li>
            <li> Smell great and is very gentle. But I really don&#x27;t like the rubbery texture of the skin that Castile soap leaves behind. I felt like It just leaves a film over the skin instead of cleaning it. It may be just me and my preference but I didn&#x27;t like this for my son. It wasn&#x27;t so bad where I had to stop using it. I finished the bottle and went on to another brand.</li>
            <li> I like the ingredient list but because it burned my sweet little angel&#x27;s eyes, we stopped using it as a shampoo.  I know it warns about this on the label but what small child cooperates all the time and keeps their head back?  We have since moved on to using California baby shampoo since it doesn&#x27;t burn if it accidentally gets in the eyes. (after hearing my baby cry in pain, I tried several different products in my own eyes and CB truly does not burn at all)</li>
            <li> Love all earth mama products. Soo natural and safe for my family. Love the smell and my daughter loves it too.</li>
            <li> Love the ingredients, love the brand.  The brand is very open about their ingredients. I always try to buy chemical-free, safer products for my little ones.&lt;br /&gt;Comes out as a foam, doesn&#x27;t really suds though.&lt;br /&gt;I only have 1 complaint and that is actually the scent.  It is lavender, but it is a very strong lavender, and lingers in the hair after a bath.  Some probably love it, but it was a little strong for my preference.</li>
            <li> The packages was leaking when arrived. More than half of the bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> Awesome baby soap/shampoo! Smells very...lavendery (made up word?), which I love and I feel good about using it on my baby. In fact, he hasn&#x27;t ever used anything but this soap. He is almost 4 months old and this one bottle is still almost half full, a little goes a long way. I definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> Buen producto, le sirve a mi bebe, no le hizo ninguna reacción alérgica, muy fácil de usar por ser espuma... Contenta con la compra.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that their is people concerned enough about making a natural product out there. I have been very concerned about the chemicals in many of our everyday products. I got rid of the Johnson and Johnson shampoo I had and ordered this. I am so glad I did. It dosen&#x27;t take much and lathers nicely. It will last for a long time and won&#x27;t hurt my children. It smells great too!</li>
            <li> Pure, natural and smells like a spa. The scent is not strong but it&#x27;s just enough to make you feel clean and fresh. I&#x27;ve been using this since I found out I was pregnant and I will continue to do so afterwards, the fact that it is chemical free makes the cost worth it. This bottle lasts forever too--- honesty I use about 2 pumps a day and it lasted me 6 months.</li>
            <li> The smell is awful. I had to give my daughter another bath later because I just couldn&#x27;t handle the smell. Doesn&#x27;t smell at all like lavender.</li>
            <li> I love Earth Mama Angel Baby. The soaps are so gentle for baby and the smells are soooo fantastic. I love that it is scented with essential oils and I can completely trust that I&#x27;m not putting anything harmful onto my babys skin. Personally, I use this particular bottle (lavender) for myself in the shower. I have really sensitive skin and this is so gentle and leaves the softest scent- it&#x27;s not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> Smells great and the smell lingers in the hair for a long time- not overpowering tho.  Great body wash as well.</li>
            <li> EMAB has never let me down and this is no different. It smells amazing, lathers up so nicely, and my kiddo&#x27;s hair feels soft as ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s funny people are upset that it will sting your eyes. Every natural brand of baby soap is not sting-free, because those ingredients are not good for your babies eyes or body. I&#x27;ve never used tear-free soap on my kids, and it&#x27;s never been an issue. This soap is actually easier to keep out of their eyes because it&#x27;s a foaming pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, love this soap and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, environmentally safe product and good for the skin. It comes out if a foam - which is nice and helps you use less. I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars because occasionally the push-dispenser is hard to push down to get soap. I wish they made a vanilla-lavender scent soap. I would prefer that over the straight lavender - even with the dispenser issues.</li>
            <li> Although I wasn&#x27;t as fond of the scent as I thought I would be, the shampoo/body wash is great for my son. It leaves his skin soft and not over dried.</li>
            <li> We loved this and when it ran out we bought the much larger bottle of the same thing.  Also, once it was gone (it lasted a pretty long time too), we removed the label and now use as a foaming soap dispenser in the kids bathroom.  I love everything about this product.  Thanks to the ewg.org, which is where I learned about the product to begin with!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product at all. It left my hair feeling sticky and dry. Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. It might have just been my hair type.</li>
            <li> My baby&#x27;s skin is very delicate and I&#x27;m still to see if this soap will help , but it does not smell good at all and doesn&#x27;t feel like my baby is clean</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful! I&#x27;ve used it from day 1 with our 4th child along with the oil and lotion from this company. Her skin is flawless and beautiful! And it smells awesome! It smells very clean and the light lavender scent is very relaxing for both you and baby during bathtub. Our 11 yo son even steals it to shower with, its that good. I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else for babies, the ingredients will leave you with peace of mind. No chemicals! And leave baby smelling clean and fresh. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> We have used the EMAB shampoo and body wash off and on for the past 2 years.  For most of that time we used the unscented variety and have been using the Lavender Vanilla for the past several months, which we prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros: no toxins, nice scent (not overpowering but lasts longer than California Baby&#x27;s lavender scent), allergy-friendly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons are that the pump can&#x27;t be used with one hand (the bottle is not heavy enough, so it falls over if you push on the top one-handed, which is an issue if you are holding a baby), my toddler can&#x27;t do it on his own, and it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;suds&amp;#34; super well.  The suds issue is only a problem now that my son is old enough to want &amp;#34;bubbles&amp;#34; in his bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the bottle clearly warns that it is NOT a no-tears formula, my son has never complained of soap in his eyes and we use this as soap and shampoo for him.  I generally use 4-6 pumps per bathing as a minimum and a single bottle lasts us for a few months with ~3 bathings per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: At 2.5 years, my son now doesn&#x27;t like this soap as he&#x27;s now aware that it stings his eyes. He prefers the EO lavender every kids soap. It also suds better in the bath for bubbles.</li>
            <li> This soap is very natural and has a great lavender smell! Good foaming. Very gentle soap. Washes away easily. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product since there seems to be great reviews but I just couldn&#x27;t like it. Performance is not what I expected. I have to use many pumps just to get a baby clean, but then doesn&#x27;t really feel clean since it feels so dry after a wash &amp; it doesn&#x27;t make my baby&#x27;s hair feel soft at all, more dry feeling to it. Does not form bubbles w/ a wash cloth so you have to rub the foam soap all over your baby&#x27;s body w/ your bare hands. It does wash away w/ a splash of water; not sure if its a good thing? I even tried it out first and it does make your skin feel so dry afterwards. Maybe it&#x27;s just the way they make their soap. Will use it since I can&#x27;t return it &amp; has organic stuff &amp; nontoxic for baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> Smells great, bought bc I thought would be gentle but it&#x27;s extremely drying to the skin makes eczema conditions worse!</li>
