            <li>my beloved makeup that ive used for years has been fazed out, the company no longer makes it.</li>
            <li>It came quickly and in great condition!</li>
            <li>Even with primer, some of this foundation slid off my face, and no matter how lightly I applied it, it was incredibly cake-y/thick.</li>
            <li>Delivery and transaction was very smooth though!</li>
            <li>Love Dinair foundation!</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It flows through my airbrush well even though it&#x27;s made by another popular airbrush company.</li>
            <li>The bottle itself was also very prone to leaking or squirting out an incredible amount of makeup with the slightest provocation.</li>
            <li>- Vanilla is for a very light complexion.</li>
            <li>I love the Vanilla foundation by dianir</li>
            <li>Recommended by Kandee Johnson, this is my favorite foundation.</li>

            <li>Color chart runs true to what you see and all foundations are a nice matt leaving any glow up to you to apply separately if you wish.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;-I bought the Vanilla, and it&#x27;s very true to the color that it&#x27;s represented as online.</li>
            <li>I was very happy with the quick delivery of this makeup and low cost.  </li>
            <li>The Dinair airbrush makeup goes on smooth with the right amount of&lt;br /&gt;coverage for a flawless look, the Vanilla color can be mixed with other&lt;br /&gt;colors easily.</li>
            <li>This is a huge let-down.</li>
            <li>Packaging was secure for me, it came in one piece with no leaks.</li>
            <li>I tried everything to get it to stop, and even had my more even handed friend try and dole out a reasonable amount of makeup.</li>
            <li>The shade was perfect, it provides great coverage without being cake-y, has a very nice matte photo finish, and my foundation looks far more like what I expected (but was previously disappointed not to get) from airbrush foundation.  </li>
            <li>Great product, long time repeat customer due to quick delivery and good quality.</li>
            <li>This color of this makeup is accurate and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>They were right on with color</li>
            <li>first time I tried Dinair (today), I was amazed.  </li>
            <li>I really adore this makeup!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described, fast shipping!</li>

            <li>i&#x27;m VERY light skinned with pink undertones.</li>
            <li>I did so much research before buying the DINAIR system and boy was</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, as much as I wanted to like this product, I could not.</li>
            <li>i just wish it had more beige undertones, it brings out the pink undertones in my skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much lighter, covers better, and lasts longer than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Tried several clean brushes as well as a beauty blender for application before having to settle on fingers.  </li>
            <li>Dinair foundation gives more product for less money and the colors are void of the dreaded orange.</li>

            <li>Too thick compared to luminess air foindation but better coverage.</li>
            <li>There are lots of tricks you can use to get the look you want, especially if you have problem areas to cover, or if you have mature</li>
            <li>The color was too dark, but it isn&#x27;t really dinair&#x27;s fault that I am borderline albino.</li>

            <li> Given all of the issues I had with this product, and the fact that the bottle didn&#x27;t last me nearly as long as any other of the similarly sized foundation I&#x27;ve tried, the price was exorbitant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s laughable that someone could give this advice and still be credible--</li>
            <li> When mixing foundations in the cup, I feel like I lose half of the foundation just because it doesn&#x27;t actually dispense properly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried two other brands in various colors/foundations and none of them have done this except Dinair.</li>
            <li> And I have dry skin even.  </li>
            <li> so i was forced to find something new.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not even getting into the fact that Dinair sells 1.15 ounces for less than Luminess charges for only .55 ounces...</li>
            <li> I now mix this one with another brand that&#x27;s a little thicker to minimize this sticking.&lt;br /&gt;-Could be just me, but my face seems extra oily with this stuff.</li>
            <li> After reading many other reviews, I decided to try Dinair because I was VERY unhappy with Luminess Air&#x27;s finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Extremely watered down.  </li>
            <li> I purchased Vanilla to add to the honey beige that was a bit too dark for my skin</li>
            <li> I ordered a slightly darker shade this time but for the price and size of the bottle</li>
            <li> Requires less makeup to cover though.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your moolah girls (or guys).</li>
            <li> Just feels too heavy on face.</li>
            <li> The minute you get it on your skin in dries in a spot and spreading it evenly with a foundation brush or fingertips is close to impossible and leaves an uneven blend on skin.</li>
            <li> I used Luminesse, but hated the orange tint and needed a lot for coverage making it pricey for everyday.</li>
            <li> This makeup also caused me to break out incredibly badly, which caused me to need a heavier coat, which made my skin even crankier...</li>
            <li> I will either never follow any advice from that youtuber again, or I&#x27;ll contact Dinair to see if I got a bad one.  </li>
            <li> I disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Had to swallow some makeup remover after to get the nasty taste out of my mouth.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I did so much research before buying the DINAIR system and boy was I disappointed.  This makeup did NOT stay on my face. And I have dry skin even.  I tried for almost three months with this makeup and finally gave up.  I emailed the company who informed me that the had a long lasting line (the I know for a fact was not out when I was doing my research).  Since I purchased it on Amazon and not through them the company would not stand by their product.  Don&#x27;t waste your moolah girls (or guys).</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the quick delivery of this makeup and low cost.  I would order again.  I&#x27;ve been using this make-up for a while and find that it is better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used in the past.</li>
            <li> I love the Vanilla foundation by dianir it goes on flawlessly! Happy with my purchase. It came quickly and in great condition!</li>
            <li> Great product, long time repeat customer due to quick delivery and good quality.</li>
            <li> After reading many other reviews, I decided to try Dinair because I was VERY unhappy with Luminess Air&#x27;s finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried Dinair (today), I was amazed.  The shade was perfect, it provides great coverage without being cake-y, has a very nice matte photo finish, and my foundation looks far more like what I expected (but was previously disappointed not to get) from airbrush foundation.  It works perfectly with my Luminess Air Pro machine, too.  That&#x27;s not even getting into the fact that Dinair sells 1.15 ounces for less than Luminess charges for only .55 ounces...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you decide to try it, search YouTube for the great Dinair videos about airbrush makeup application.  There are lots of tricks you can use to get the look you want, especially if you have problem areas to cover, or if you have mature skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, goodbye Luminess Air.  I&#x27;m going to stick with Dinair from this point forward.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-I bought the Vanilla, and it&#x27;s very true to the color that it&#x27;s represented as online. As far as color match goes, you can go to Dinair&#x27;s website and send them a photo of yourself and they&#x27;ll help you match. I did this, but then ordered on Amazon because I had a gift card. They were right on with color matching.&lt;br /&gt;-It flows through my airbrush well even though it&#x27;s made by another popular airbrush company. No concerns with clogging.&lt;br /&gt;-This bottle is much bigger than you&#x27;d get for the money with some of the more expensive brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-I can&#x27;t get over how this leaves a film of makeup on the inside of my airbrush cup. I&#x27;ve tried two other brands in various colors/foundations and none of them have done this except Dinair. When mixing foundations in the cup, I feel like I lose half of the foundation just because it doesn&#x27;t actually dispense properly. I now mix this one with another brand that&#x27;s a little thicker to minimize this sticking.&lt;br /&gt;-Could be just me, but my face seems extra oily with this stuff. Maybe it&#x27;s extra drying and my face is trying to make up for it?&lt;br /&gt;-When I layer this foundation, you can definitely tell and it almost looks cakey.</li>
            <li> Recommended by Kandee Johnson, this is my favorite foundation. I use it with a foundation brush and it lasts longer than anything I&#x27;ve used.  Plus....it looks like you have perfect skin with no makeup on. GREAT!  I purchased Vanilla to add to the honey beige that was a bit too dark for my skin - Vanilla is for a very light complexion.</li>
            <li> The Dinair airbrush makeup goes on smooth with the right amount of&lt;br /&gt;coverage for a flawless look, the Vanilla color can be mixed with other&lt;br /&gt;colors easily.</li>
            <li> I really adore this makeup! It&#x27;s so much lighter, covers better, and lasts longer than other brands I&#x27;ve tried. Ordering my second bottle!</li>
            <li> The dinair makeup seems to be better than luminse. I ordered a slightly darker shade this time but for the price and size of the bottle it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, as much as I wanted to like this product, I could not. Even with primer, some of this foundation slid off my face, and no matter how lightly I applied it, it was incredibly cake-y/thick. This means that the coverage was good, but what didn&#x27;t slide off of my face cracked, making me look like a creepy porcelain doll. The color was too dark, but it isn&#x27;t really dinair&#x27;s fault that I am borderline albino. This makeup also caused me to break out incredibly badly, which caused me to need a heavier coat, which made my skin even crankier... You get the picture. The bottle itself was also very prone to leaking or squirting out an incredible amount of makeup with the slightest provocation. I tried everything to get it to stop, and even had my more even handed friend try and dole out a reasonable amount of makeup. Even her uber concentration and steady hands couldn&#x27;t get the bottle to stop throwing up its contents. Given all of the issues I had with this product, and the fact that the bottle didn&#x27;t last me nearly as long as any other of the similarly sized foundation I&#x27;ve tried, the price was exorbitant.</li>
            <li> Dinair liquid makeup goes on really good and has a good look to it, but the customer service is a joke, so if you have any problem, do not expect to get it resolved timely or professionally. If you have any problem expect to have to stay on top of it to get it resolved. Also I have found none of the shimmer makeup sprays well, but all of the glamour works really good. Since I don&#x27;t use alot of shimmer it is a good product for me, but for those of you that use shimmer, it does not spray well.</li>
            <li> I used Luminesse, but hated the orange tint and needed a lot for coverage making it pricey for everyday. I considered stopping using the compressor and everything all together. Also, even at my age the makeup tended to make me break out a little.&lt;br /&gt;The Dinair foundation gives more product for less money and the colors are void of the dreaded orange. Color chart runs true to what you see and all foundations are a nice matt leaving any glow up to you to apply separately if you wish.&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Love Dinair foundation! Lightweight with buildable coverage. Actually, helped my daughter&#x27;s acne prone skin! Would recommend this to anyone with an airbrush kit!</li>
            <li> I did not like this one bit.&lt;br /&gt;I used it without the airbrush kid and the color was way too fair - my fault. Based on youtube videos, I thought I could use this product w/out the airbrush machine. I did not like how it looked on me.</li>
            <li> This color of this makeup is accurate and the price is reasonable. I&#x27;ve been using Dinair for three years and I&#x27;m satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> Looks great on my girlfriends skin, and holds up throughout the day.  When she is out this is what she will be getting again</li>
            <li> This product is like water with tint. The minute you get it on your skin in dries in a spot and spreading it evenly with a foundation brush or fingertips is close to impossible and leaves an uneven blend on skin. Overpriced for its results. I do better with NYC foundation which is 3.99.</li>
            <li> Makeup does not taste like vanilla as stated. Had to swallow some makeup remover after to get the nasty taste out of my mouth. still 5 star</li>
            <li> my beloved makeup that ive used for years has been fazed out, the company no longer makes it. so i was forced to find something new. i&#x27;m VERY light skinned with pink undertones. this works for me but i had to add 1/2 teaspoon of cornstarch to it to thicken it a tiny bit. it works well with me airbrush. i just wish it had more beige undertones, it brings out the pink undertones in my skin and i&#x27;m not to fond of highlighting that area.</li>
            <li> Too thick compared to luminess air foindation but better coverage. Just feels too heavy on face. Requires less makeup to cover though. Would probably go back to luminess air foundation. Delivery and transaction was very smooth though!</li>
            <li> Extremely watered down.  Beads up on contact with the skin and must be rubbed in circles onto the skin for over 60 seconds in order for it to stop beading and set onto the skin.  When it&#x27;s finally setted, it looks unblended because there are marks where you were blending it into the skin.  Meant to be in an airbrush and I was told you could apply with a foundation brush.  It&#x27;s laughable that someone could give this advice and still be credible--I will either never follow any advice from that youtuber again, or I&#x27;ll contact Dinair to see if I got a bad one.  Tried several clean brushes as well as a beauty blender for application before having to settle on fingers.  Each method looked messy and unpassable for a good makeup look, in spite of my skills.  This is a huge let-down.</li>
            <li> This is my first time ordering Dinair makeup off amazon and so far it appears to be the real thing, quality is good and no funny smells or anything. Packaging was secure for me, it came in one piece with no leaks.</li>
