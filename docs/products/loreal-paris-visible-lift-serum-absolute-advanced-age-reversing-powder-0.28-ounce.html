            <li>wonderful product</li>
            <li>Has good coverage - looks great!</li>
            <li>hey I&#x27;m happy too.</li>
            <li>With the make-up it&#x27;s great and without the make-up it still great.  </li>
            <li>So glad I could get it from&lt;br /&gt;Amazon!!</li>
            <li>This was the perfect shade and is easy to apply using my brush.</li>
            <li>Great product and so cheap compared to stores!</li>
            <li>this powder is magic!</li>
            <li>but all around I think it&#x27;s a nice powder for the price.</li>
            <li>I liked it because it covers well and kinda smooths out and gets pearly accents on my skin like i glow.</li>
            <li>It covers nice.</li>
            <li>So, yes, it IS way too light, even for fair</li>
            <li>Great coverage, sets very well in place.</li>
            <li>Way to light for me but nice for someone else</li>
            <li>Love it for the price</li>
            <li>It stayed on most of the day even in the heat and humidity</li>
            <li>but thats ok:-)</li>
            <li>pressed powder looks like it would work for my skin type, but goes on much lighter and made me look like either a corpse or a Geisha - neither of which is a good look for me.  </li>
            <li>My exact color, love it!</li>
            <li>Light powder , easy to apply .  </li>
            <li>Great product for less.</li>
            <li>It does not look like my make up is layered just the right balance.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m just not liking it very much.</li>
            <li>Besides that I think if you are a big powder user you will love this.</li>
            <li>I just used this for the first time this morning</li>
            <li>could be lighter and stay longer, sits in your lines but better that some products out there, overall, dont regret it</li>
            <li>well, flat would be a better descriptor.</li>
            <li>I took a chance and ordered the Fair and figured if it is too light or doesn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;m only out a few bucks.  </li>
            <li>It made me look more aged and my skin felt drier which I never had too much of a problem with just using mineral makeup.  </li>
            <li>When it arrived I was impressed to see that the powder came crushed up and when I opened it all the powder came out and made a big mess.</li>
            <li>After still trying to use it for a few days, just to see if the coverage was there and that it might make the appearance of my skin look better</li>
            <li>so we could have a supply on hand while settling into a new house.</li>
            <li>A little too light</li>
            <li>Powder is only really go for setting foundation if you have oily skin.</li>
            <li>This make up really has helped my complextion and makes me feel younger and look younger.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> My exact color, love it!</li>
            <li> Has good coverage - looks great!</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift - actually nabbed 9 of these while the price was low ($2.26) so we could have a supply on hand while settling into a new house. The price was affordable and it seems this is the only product she will use, so hey I&#x27;m happy too.</li>
            <li> I only give one star to leave a review! My product was busted unusable! Shipping was too long!!</li>
            <li> I took a chance and ordered the Fair and figured if it is too light or doesn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;m only out a few bucks.  So, yes, it IS way too light, even for fair skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pressed powder looks like it would work for my skin type, but goes on much lighter and made me look like either a corpse or a Geisha - neither of which is a good look for me.  After still trying to use it for a few days, just to see if the coverage was there and that it might make the appearance of my skin look better (in case I was to try a darker shade) it did not.  It made me look more aged and my skin felt drier which I never had too much of a problem with just using mineral makeup.  So, although it sounded like it might work, it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Powder is only really go for setting foundation if you have oily skin. If you have dry skin I recommend not using ANY powder, unless you use a tinted moisturizer or foundation. Besides that I think if you are a big powder user you will love this. Great coverage, sets very well in place. Not sure if it will make a difference in my skin (wrinkles/lines) but all around I think it&#x27;s a nice powder for the price.</li>
            <li> Great product and so cheap compared to stores! Minor scratches on outside of plastic but no biggie, intact inside! üëç</li>
            <li> When it arrived I was impressed to see that the powder came crushed up and when I opened it all the powder came out and made a big mess. I got a replacement but either way it was not a good powder and wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like it, just blend well and it takes a few minutes before i look luminous, but im only 26 and dont have alot of lines. I liked it because it covers well and kinda smooths out and gets pearly accents on my skin like i glow.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have wrinkles and this settled into every crease nook and cranny! It clumped in clusters on my face and looked like I have flesh colored pancake batter on my face!! Never purchasing from Loreal againüò±!!</li>
            <li> I like the product but I do not like the applicator. I like the pad applicators. This comes with a little brush. It covers nice.</li>
            <li> Way to light for me but nice for someone else</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because I have been using this item for a long time.  Needless to say, it was taken off or discontinued from the stores and I was unable to find it.

            <li> Love it for the price</li>
            <li> I just used this for the first time this morning and I&#x27;m just not liking it very much. It feels sort of stiff on my face and as for luminous...well, flat would be a better descriptor. Not matte. Flat. I still have a little of the old version left. I guess I&#x27;ll ration it while I search for a replacement. Yet again I find myself wondering why cosmetic companies have to change things that work. (Sighing deeply.)</li>
            <li> Light powder , easy to apply .  It stayed on most of the day even in the heat and humidity</li>
            <li> could be lighter and stay longer, sits in your lines but better that some products out there, overall, dont regret it</li>
            <li> This was the perfect shade and is easy to apply using my brush. Its great over my base. It does not look like my make up is layered just the right balance.</li>
            <li> This make up really has helped my complextion and makes me feel younger and look younger.</li>
            <li> I wish the color matched my skin! It doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Came on time and works well. A little too light but thats ok:-)</li>
            <li> this powder is magic! wonderful product</li>
            <li> Great product for less. Keeps my face dry in which i need when working lots of hours</li>
