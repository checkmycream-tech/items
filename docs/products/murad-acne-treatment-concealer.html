            <li>It does not provide good coverage in fact it made my acne area look flaky after applying just don&#x27;t don&#x27;t buy and save money.</li>
            <li>Quality is good.</li>
            <li>Physician&#x27;s Formula has a good one I use now.   </li>
            <li>this is a good product, helps heal scars and while helping acme go away and helps conceal the acme while healing.</li>
            <li>-this works fairly well for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a creamy stick, and spreads fairly evenly over skin.</li>
            <li>i feel good about what makeup im putting on my acne when i have this on.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li>I think my wife bought this, and since she is beautiful and always looks gorgeous, I think I love it.</li>
            <li>works well covers nice</li>
            <li>It has a nice yellowundertone about it.   </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own).</li>
            <li>My skin is very fair, sensitive, oily, and scars easily - kind of a nightmare!  </li>
            <li>It is a great color, blends easily and stays put most of the day.</li>
            <li>It feels great, has the exactly right amount of coverage, and i can wear it without worrying that my make up is causing breakouts.</li>
            <li>blends so easily!</li>
            <li>Nice coverage and goes on nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>I love this concealer &amp; Amazon has the best price by far.</li>
            <li>It is one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li>I dont know how great it really works for acne, it seems it keeps everything under control.</li>
            <li>Stays on better than the solution cream for breakouts.  </li>
            <li>I have yet to find anything better.</li>
            <li>it was not for my combo skin and made it more irritated.  </li>
            <li>You can get it at target, Walgreens, and most drugstores.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Really love this concealer for my acne blemishes and scars.</li>
            <li>This works as well or better.</li>
            <li>most salicylic acne treatments, I don&#x27;t know</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it makes a phenomenal difference</li>
            <li>Love this product but ordering did not give me the color options.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and it draws more attention to it.</li>
            <li>One stick lasts me probably about 6 months and it is just fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love this product as both a blemish concealer and as a treatment for acne.</li>
            <li>It is a good product when the color is right.</li>
            <li>I keep this in my emergency make up bag in my purse because in a pinch it will work great for anything on face and having the solid stick formula is very appealing to me for travelling and heat/cold exposure.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for acne, but also great for other uses!  </li>
            <li>It covers light spots great but not darker spots so much.</li>
            <li>However, when I have gone make-up free and used or used a more potent acne treatment, my acne clears faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amazing concealar very thick, perfect for covering acne or pimples, In love with this Concealar!</li>
            <li>Very good coverage overall!</li>
            <li>good product and fast delivery</li>
            <li>Try as you might, you cannot blend it well with fingers or wash it off easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easily blendable.</li>
            <li>well while giving effective coverage (you can still see my problem areas if you look real close, but it&#x27;s better than going without.</li>
            <li>Does not cause skin irritation or breakouts and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this prduct because it is long-lasting and provides supperior coverage.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect shade for my extremely pale skin and stays on longer than most concealers.</li>
            <li>product is pretty easy to use and it covers the redness effectively.</li>
            <li>It seemed like a good buy though it was about 5 times the price of what I normally pay for this sort of thing.</li>
            <li>Feels light</li>
            <li>The result is that there are light toned patches all over your face.</li>
            <li>In order to make it smooth, I have to use make-up primer, defeating the purpose of me using this product in order to not wear makeup.</li>
            <li>I used to swear by a zit cream/concealer by Charles of the Ritz, which is no longer available.</li>
            <li>They sent me Light</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product when you have an especially red pimple (or post pimple scar) that there&#x27;s nothing you can do about and need to cover it up to go out.</li>
            <li>I have light to medium skin tone</li>
            <li>It blends with my skin color perfectly and can only be noticed if someone is looking really closely.</li>
            <li>I really do like this product!!!  </li>
            <li>The main reason I continue to use this product every once in a while is because it is medicated and does not cause me to break out; however, as a concealer, it is definitely not the best.</li>
            <li>This is the lightest color you can get, however, it is too dark for very fair skin like mine.</li>
            <li>I must say I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>you like it as much as I do! :)</li>
            <li>Love it, just wish i bought the medium at first.</li>
            <li>Overall its a good quality concealer.</li>
            <li>and this is nice because it does not irritate my already sensitive skin when applied.</li>
            <li>This concealer provides good coverage and is very solid but blendable.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s overall a good concealer.</li>
            <li>She really just has most of her breakouts on her forehead, but this makes it look like dots on her forehead.</li>
            <li>dry formula, light shade is very light, you might be better off with a medium if youre unsure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s great at actually getting rid of blemishes, but it is a great concealer</li>
            <li>I have tried many different make-ups and acne treatments that promise not to clog your pores and be healthy for your skin, but nothing comes close to the Murad concealer.</li>
            <li>It does rub in, but I think I would like this product more with a more extensive variety of shades.</li>
            <li>I am consistently pleased with Murad products and this one is just as good if not better than all of the others I have tried.</li>
            <li>For anyone that is self conscious or would like to treat acne without causing more, I suggest you give this a try.</li>
            <li>I completely switched all of my make up over a month ago, so I can&#x27;t tell whether it is this or the foundation, but my skin has never been better.</li>
            <li>Worth the money, lasts all day.</li>
            <li>THE WORST;&lt;br /&gt;ANAPHYLAXIS â€” a rare, life-threatening allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;Anaphylaxis requires an immediate trip to the emergency department and an injection of epinephrine.</li>
            <li>For this reason, I have to give it four stars, wouldn&#x27;t you say that is a rare find?</li>
            <li>However, as I played with it a little more, I grew to love it.  </li>
            <li>I had to use a concealer brush, and even then, it would smear (kind of) onto my face, dry, and then not want to move.</li>
            <li>this product is very good for dark spots, red spots and scars.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not thick, heavy or dry, so it goes on nicely and blends easily while giving nice coverage.</li>
            <li>really recommend this concealer!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty they are paied.</li>
            <li>Exactly like description.</li>
            <li>All three of my teen boys love it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only $5 or $6, and I like it better.</li>
            <li>My first stick of this lasted about 8 months.  </li>
            <li>It only costs about $10, but I use it way faster probably within two months and this murad product also provides better coverage.  </li>
            <li>This concealer does its job pretty well.</li>
            <li>I apply it to any occasional acne that I get or any scars that I may have and then apply my foundation on top of it.</li>
            <li>I have really oily skin, and have tried many different acne products.  </li>
            <li>As long as I use a light hand and don&#x27;t cake this on, I find that it works fantastically!  </li>
            <li>but it certainly doesn&#x27;t add to the problem and covers well</li>
            <li>This concealer is a good product because it is highly pigmented and covers thoroughly with very little product.  </li>
            <li>I have Murad acne treatment face wash that I really like.  </li>
            <li>I get very oily skin throughout the day</li>
            <li>I really like this concealer.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Thanks Mike</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really like this</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I have yet to really feel like the salicylic acid is working and getting rid of them sooner...</li>
            <li>highly recommended!</li>
            <li>This is an absolute must have product for me.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell that it&#x27;s helped her skin that much.</li>
            <li>I like this product a whole lot.  </li>
            <li>Generally I use this because while I do not believe it is necessarily treating my acne-it certainly isn&#x27;t causing it any more irritation.</li>
            <li>It may cover better if you pile it on or apply other products over it).</li>
            <li>but there are other products that offer similar medication and can cover better such as Clinique Acne Solution Clearing Concealer which works better for me.  </li>
            <li>They not only effectively conceal blemishes, but they clear them up in a  relatively short period of time.  </li>
            <li>I expected something that would apply easily and blend well with my skin tone.</li>
            <li>It contained SALICYLIC ACID which the main metabolite of ASPIRIN.</li>
            <li>I applied multiple layers on the spot but the cream seemed to disappear quickly.</li>
            <li>I put a little dab on my finger dip and tap it on top.</li>
            <li>so it spreads a little better on the infected area.</li>
            <li>The other thing I do appreciate about this product is how easy it can be used cuz the stick design.</li>
            <li>It seems like if I use this stuff the zit will clear up much faster than if I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>it seems, it&#x27;ll make any dry flaking on your face about ten times more visible, exfoliating and moisturizing beforehand be damned.</li>
            <li>Only problem is you have to reapply it often as it comes right off.</li>
            <li>Covers up breakouts while preventing new ones.</li>
            <li>I thought I would try this for extra help, but I don&#x27;t really think it does much for acne.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>For the price though, I was hoping that this concealer would prove better than its cheaper counterparts, but as I&#x27;ve should have learned by now, there are no magic wands when it comes to problem skin.</li>
            <li>It does blend very well, and I don&#x27;t have trouble matching this to most different types of foundations that I would</li>
            <li>but it is on the same level or better as other concealers in this price range.</li>
            <li>But it just stays on that greasy active boy skin longer for a more lasting effect.</li>
            <li>It did not provide adequate coverage that I had expected.  </li>
            <li>It was a little too light for my skin color</li>
            <li>They are far better than hard sticks like this one.</li>
            <li>Now I cannot attest to the effectiveness of the actual treatment in the concealer, I don&#x27;t know if it really helps clear up my acne, but that&#x27;s not the purpose I bought it for.  </li>
            <li>because it&#x27;s a concealer but also will help clear the blemishes.  </li>
            <li>It covers my red spots very well and also helps heal them acne.</li>
            <li>I would not waste my money on this.</li>
            <li>It stays better than any expensive concealers I&#x27;ve used and is fabulous at reducing the red.</li>
            <li>Although I am noticing a difference in my pimples, this product does not treat them completely.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a super light concealer, so if you&#x27;re very, very pale, i may be too dark.</li>
            <li>So, I am usually somewhat cheap when it comes to make up.</li>
            <li>My item was missing for some unknown reason and the seller was willing to reship one to me!!!</li>
            <li>Also, most importantly, this is one of few concealers you will find that actually HELPS acne instead of just making it a thousand times worse.</li>
            <li>My 15 year old son loves this and uses it daily.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s the only thing I can use directly on acne, for a pin point concealer.</li>
            <li>, I only use it directly on the acne spots.</li>
            <li>I find my skin actually clears up when I don&#x27;t wear makeup and let my skin be natural and breathe.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay not great for me though.</li>
            <li>I would like to start by saying I&#x27;m not certain this product really treats acne.  </li>
            <li>I use other Murad products though and really trust the line, so I don&#x27;t plan on changing to another concealer.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t looked too much into the ingredients, beyond the salicylic acid (which I know reduces inflammation and exfoliates, but I don&#x27;t know anything about the other ingredients).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how much it actually removes acne, but it definitely goes on to the skin really smoothly</li>
            <li>I could budge it a little with the brush, but other wise I had to press hard and irritate my bumps-</li>

            <li> Love this product but ordering did not give me the color options.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> and it draws more attention to it.</li>
            <li> One stick lasts me probably about 6 months and it is just fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love this product as both a blemish concealer and as a treatment for acne.</li>
            <li> It is a good product when the color is right.</li>
            <li> I keep this in my emergency make up bag in my purse because in a pinch it will work great for anything on face and having the solid stick formula is very appealing to me for travelling and heat/cold exposure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for acne, but also great for other uses!  </li>
            <li> It covers light spots great but not darker spots so much.</li>
            <li> However, when I have gone make-up free and used or used a more potent acne treatment, my acne clears faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Amazing concealar very thick, perfect for covering acne or pimples, In love with this Concealar!</li>
            <li> Very good coverage overall!</li>
            <li> good product and fast delivery</li>
            <li> Try as you might, you cannot blend it well with fingers or wash it off easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easily blendable.</li>
            <li> well while giving effective coverage (you can still see my problem areas if you look real close, but it&#x27;s better than going without.</li>
            <li> Does not cause skin irritation or breakouts and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this prduct because it is long-lasting and provides supperior coverage.</li>
            <li> It is the perfect shade for my extremely pale skin and stays on longer than most concealers.</li>
            <li> product is pretty easy to use and it covers the redness effectively.</li>
            <li> It seemed like a good buy though it was about 5 times the price of what I normally pay for this sort of thing.</li>
            <li> Feels light</li>
            <li> The result is that there are light toned patches all over your face.</li>
            <li> In order to make it smooth, I have to use make-up primer, defeating the purpose of me using this product in order to not wear makeup.</li>
            <li> I used to swear by a zit cream/concealer by Charles of the Ritz, which is no longer available.</li>
            <li> They sent me Light</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product when you have an especially red pimple (or post pimple scar) that there&#x27;s nothing you can do about and need to cover it up to go out.</li>
            <li> I have light to medium skin tone</li>
            <li> It blends with my skin color perfectly and can only be noticed if someone is looking really closely.</li>
            <li> I really do like this product!!!  </li>
            <li> The main reason I continue to use this product every once in a while is because it is medicated and does not cause me to break out; however, as a concealer, it is definitely not the best.</li>
            <li> This is the lightest color you can get, however, it is too dark for very fair skin like mine.</li>
            <li> I must say I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> you like it as much as I do! :)</li>
            <li> Love it, just wish i bought the medium at first.</li>
            <li> Overall its a good quality concealer.</li>
            <li> and this is nice because it does not irritate my already sensitive skin when applied.</li>
            <li> This concealer provides good coverage and is very solid but blendable.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s overall a good concealer.</li>
            <li> She really just has most of her breakouts on her forehead, but this makes it look like dots on her forehead.</li>
            <li> dry formula, light shade is very light, you might be better off with a medium if youre unsure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s great at actually getting rid of blemishes, but it is a great concealer</li>
            <li> I have tried many different make-ups and acne treatments that promise not to clog your pores and be healthy for your skin, but nothing comes close to the Murad concealer.</li>
            <li> It does rub in, but I think I would like this product more with a more extensive variety of shades.</li>
            <li> I am consistently pleased with Murad products and this one is just as good if not better than all of the others I have tried.</li>
            <li> For anyone that is self conscious or would like to treat acne without causing more, I suggest you give this a try.</li>
            <li> I completely switched all of my make up over a month ago, so I can&#x27;t tell whether it is this or the foundation, but my skin has never been better.</li>
            <li> Worth the money, lasts all day.</li>
            <li> THE WORST;&lt;br /&gt;ANAPHYLAXIS â€” a rare, life-threatening allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;Anaphylaxis requires an immediate trip to the emergency department and an injection of epinephrine.</li>
            <li> For this reason, I have to give it four stars, wouldn&#x27;t you say that is a rare find?</li>
            <li> However, as I played with it a little more, I grew to love it.  </li>
            <li> I had to use a concealer brush, and even then, it would smear (kind of) onto my face, dry, and then not want to move.</li>
            <li> this product is very good for dark spots, red spots and scars.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not thick, heavy or dry, so it goes on nicely and blends easily while giving nice coverage.</li>
            <li> really recommend this concealer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty they are paied.</li>
            <li> Exactly like description.</li>
            <li> All three of my teen boys love it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only $5 or $6, and I like it better.</li>
            <li> My first stick of this lasted about 8 months.  </li>
            <li> It only costs about $10, but I use it way faster probably within two months and this murad product also provides better coverage.  </li>
            <li> This concealer does its job pretty well.</li>
            <li> I apply it to any occasional acne that I get or any scars that I may have and then apply my foundation on top of it.</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin, and have tried many different acne products.  </li>
            <li> As long as I use a light hand and don&#x27;t cake this on, I find that it works fantastically!  </li>
            <li> but it certainly doesn&#x27;t add to the problem and covers well</li>
            <li> This concealer is a good product because it is highly pigmented and covers thoroughly with very little product.  </li>
            <li> I have Murad acne treatment face wash that I really like.  </li>
            <li> I get very oily skin throughout the day</li>
            <li> I really like this concealer.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Thanks Mike</li>
            <li> I really recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really like this</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I have yet to really feel like the salicylic acid is working and getting rid of them sooner...</li>
            <li> highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is an absolute must have product for me.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell that it&#x27;s helped her skin that much.</li>
            <li> I like this product a whole lot.  </li>
            <li> Generally I use this because while I do not believe it is necessarily treating my acne-it certainly isn&#x27;t causing it any more irritation.</li>
            <li> It may cover better if you pile it on or apply other products over it).</li>
            <li> but there are other products that offer similar medication and can cover better such as Clinique Acne Solution Clearing Concealer which works better for me.  </li>
            <li> They not only effectively conceal blemishes, but they clear them up in a  relatively short period of time.  </li>
            <li> I expected something that would apply easily and blend well with my skin tone.</li>
            <li> It contained SALICYLIC ACID which the main metabolite of ASPIRIN.</li>
            <li> I applied multiple layers on the spot but the cream seemed to disappear quickly.</li>
            <li> I put a little dab on my finger dip and tap it on top.</li>
            <li> so it spreads a little better on the infected area.</li>
            <li> The other thing I do appreciate about this product is how easy it can be used cuz the stick design.</li>
            <li> It seems like if I use this stuff the zit will clear up much faster than if I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> it seems, it&#x27;ll make any dry flaking on your face about ten times more visible, exfoliating and moisturizing beforehand be damned.</li>
            <li> Only problem is you have to reapply it often as it comes right off.</li>
            <li> Covers up breakouts while preventing new ones.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try this for extra help, but I don&#x27;t really think it does much for acne.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> For the price though, I was hoping that this concealer would prove better than its cheaper counterparts, but as I&#x27;ve should have learned by now, there are no magic wands when it comes to problem skin.</li>
            <li> It does blend very well, and I don&#x27;t have trouble matching this to most different types of foundations that I would</li>
            <li> but it is on the same level or better as other concealers in this price range.</li>
            <li> But it just stays on that greasy active boy skin longer for a more lasting effect.</li>
            <li> It did not provide adequate coverage that I had expected.  </li>
            <li> It was a little too light for my skin color</li>
            <li> They are far better than hard sticks like this one.</li>
            <li> Now I cannot attest to the effectiveness of the actual treatment in the concealer, I don&#x27;t know if it really helps clear up my acne, but that&#x27;s not the purpose I bought it for.  </li>
            <li> because it&#x27;s a concealer but also will help clear the blemishes.  </li>
            <li> It covers my red spots very well and also helps heal them acne.</li>
            <li> I would not waste my money on this.</li>
            <li> It stays better than any expensive concealers I&#x27;ve used and is fabulous at reducing the red.</li>
            <li> Although I am noticing a difference in my pimples, this product does not treat them completely.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a super light concealer, so if you&#x27;re very, very pale, i may be too dark.</li>
            <li> So, I am usually somewhat cheap when it comes to make up.</li>
            <li> My item was missing for some unknown reason and the seller was willing to reship one to me!!!</li>
            <li> Also, most importantly, this is one of few concealers you will find that actually HELPS acne instead of just making it a thousand times worse.</li>
            <li> My 15 year old son loves this and uses it daily.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s the only thing I can use directly on acne, for a pin point concealer.</li>
            <li> , I only use it directly on the acne spots.</li>
            <li> I find my skin actually clears up when I don&#x27;t wear makeup and let my skin be natural and breathe.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay not great for me though.</li>
            <li> I would like to start by saying I&#x27;m not certain this product really treats acne.  </li>
            <li> I use other Murad products though and really trust the line, so I don&#x27;t plan on changing to another concealer.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t looked too much into the ingredients, beyond the salicylic acid (which I know reduces inflammation and exfoliates, but I don&#x27;t know anything about the other ingredients).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much it actually removes acne, but it definitely goes on to the skin really smoothly</li>
            <li> I could budge it a little with the brush, but other wise I had to press hard and irritate my bumps-</li>
            <li> it works really well at covering up blemishes, even on my pale</li>
            <li> My skin is red, with little scars and breakouts on my chin area, is dry in the winter, has an oily t-zone in the winter and summer, blackheads on my nose year round, and my cheeks are pretty much normal, with some occasional whiteheads.</li>
            <li> I put this on and it usually either prevents the pimple from showing up entirely or shortens the stay and lessens appearance of one and it covers any signs of redness very well.</li>
            <li> My one complaint is that the color is a little more yellow/orange than I expected.</li>
            <li> I would definitely try it if you have breakouts or even minor blemishes.</li>
            <li> This product grew on me - when I first got it and applied it, I thought that the color match was way too orange and that the consistency was way too thick.  </li>
            <li> I was really disappointed, because I&#x27;ve used Murad moisturizers in the past and thought they were very good.</li>
            <li> thought i would have to buy a new stick every few months</li>
            <li> My acne scars have faded considerably and I have been breaking out less in the places where I have used this.  </li>
            <li> I feel like it made my skin very dry and flaky when I would use it but not every one has the same skin type.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t leave home now without it and will continue to use it for minor touch ups.</li>
            <li> Type: 20-something, acne prone, sensitive, semi-pigmented, few lines.</li>
            <li> When I take my makeup off at the end of the day my pimples are noticeably smaller and less red.</li>
            <li> The reason I won&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because if the pigment can cluster and cake if it begins to peel - not different from other heavier concelears in that regard.</li>
            <li> Blends well and hides well, but carries the same problem as any other concealer in any price range: if you have dry, acne-prone skin and use this, or any concealer</li>
            <li> The Salycidic Acid did nothing for the existing spots, and it made the spots I put it on dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dry and looks flaky on the skin.  </li>
            <li> While it covers up redness, it also magnifies dry skin spots.</li>
            <li> I will get blemishes at the worst possible times and this product does a great job of making them invisible.  </li>
            <li> Reactions generally occur within a few hours of putting the cream on.</li>
            <li> Also the color tone is too dark for my Asian skin.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like other concealers with acne medicine in it and stays put all day.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it does not last all day, probably around 6-7 hours and you need another application.</li>
            <li> I found this stick when my sister was looking for an acne clearing concealer a few years back.</li>
            <li> This works just as I expected it too.  </li>
            <li> Over the years I have tried a few different brands, and Murad and Proactiv are the two Concealers I like best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I literally received an empty box.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for making the blemish go away any faster, however it doesn&#x27;t make it any worse.</li>
            <li> I use this product religiously, and once I ordered it, it was shipped to my house in less than a week!</li>
            <li> I have had the same little tube for the past 8 months and there is still a little left with me using it almost daily.</li>
            <li> I still use it for under eye circles and as a bit of cover up whenever I go to the library or the gym (in other words, when I expect to not have to interact with others).</li>
            <li> I use it on pimples too if they are small enough to hide.</li>
            <li> but it does seem like it makes my pimples last longer than they usually would.</li>
            <li> I have other productions I can put on at night for that.  </li>
            <li> Yu can&#x27;t use this if you have an active whitedead or red bump because you will have to press hard to get this to go anywhere.</li>
            <li> but when I do, I get rather dark red spots that are hard to cover up.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily, is not greasy and does the job.&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure about the medicated aspect of the product, but for cosmetic purposes I would say it is a definite YES!</li>
            <li> Tried this a half a year ago.</li>
            <li> I bought this item at a Sephora store after reading the positive reviews on Amazon but the result I got was rather disappointing.</li>
            <li> Even at the end of the day it remains and doesn&#x27;t look caked on like other products have done to me in the past.</li>
            <li> I used this to try to cover the little spot and scars on my chin.</li>
            <li> I use it all the time on little cover ups that are needed.</li>
            <li> I would find another product to use as a spot treatment and continue to use this as an everyday canceler.</li>
            <li> I always use concealers that claim to treat your acne because I feel they are at least unlikely to cause new acne.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday!  </li>
            <li> I usually wear this over a moisturizer</li>
            <li> It was hard to find a concealer that was also a treatment.  </li>
            <li> While drying out a zit, it conceals it and is hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li> It is not meant for all over concealer--or at least it gets cakey if I use it like that</li>
            <li> It is a bit thick and sticky, but I&#x27;m getting used to it.</li>
            <li> When you apply it, there is a thick waxy deposit on the skin.</li>
            <li> Returned due to wrong item ordered.</li>
            <li> when put on my face, after 3 or 4 hours, my face problem become serious.</li>
            <li> Not fair....</li>
            <li> which made it even worse.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for Neutrogena skin clearing concealer which was irritating my skin and causing breakouts.</li>
            <li> I have combination-oily skin and never have to worry that covering up my zits will make them worse.</li>
            <li> simply because the makeup stick itself broke inside of the packaging (it is still usable, but the \\&quot;stick\\&quot; is no longer attached to the base of the makeup packaging, so</li>
            <li> bought this product as a part of Murad Adult Acne Treatment which I have terrible reactions to.</li>
            <li> The seller is no nice!!!</li>
            <li> She is unhappy with how it covers and how it blends.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t need to feel guilty for putting makeup on your breakouts!</li>
            <li> so, it is my lost. :(</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> When I bought the product I was not expecting good results at all! But definitively is a great product&lt;br /&gt;Great cover and you don&#x27;t even need powder! Feels light and I do feel that controls oils and breakouts!&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend this concealer!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get fooled by the good reviews I&#x27;m pretty they are paied. It does not provide good coverage in fact it made my acne area look flaky after applying just don&#x27;t don&#x27;t buy and save money.</li>
            <li> I have Murad acne treatment face wash that I really like.  I thought I would try this for extra help, but I don&#x27;t really think it does much for acne.  It is, however, a very nice concealer.  It&#x27;s not thick, heavy or dry, so it goes on nicely and blends easily while giving nice coverage.</li>
            <li> I have been using Murad concealer now for over a year. The great thing that  I like about it is it has salicylic acid for acne. If you have a blemish and you put just a dab of this on, it dries out the pimple and also conceals any redness or inflammation. I get very oily skin throughout the day and I have fairly larger pores. So, I need to wear make-up that will not clog my pores and create blemishes or blackheads. For anyone that is self conscious or would like to treat acne without causing more, I suggest you give this a try. I have tried many different make-ups and acne treatments that promise not to clog your pores and be healthy for your skin, but nothing comes close to the Murad concealer. It is one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li> I really like this concealer. I have been using it for a month and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like other concealers with acne medicine in it and stays put all day. Even at the end of the day it remains and doesn&#x27;t look caked on like other products have done to me in the past. I completely switched all of my make up over a month ago, so I can&#x27;t tell whether it is this or the foundation, but my skin has never been better. I don&#x27;t leave home now without it and will continue to use it for minor touch ups. I would definitely try it if you have breakouts or even minor blemishes.</li>
            <li> dry formula, light shade is very light, you might be better off with a medium if youre unsure.</li>
            <li> Worth the money, lasts all day. Not solving any acne problems but it certainly doesn&#x27;t add to the problem and covers well</li>
            <li> Awesome product!  Exactly like description.</li>
            <li> Quality is good. Nice coverage and goes on nice and smooth. I dont know how great it really works for acne, it seems it keeps everything under control. Overall its a good quality concealer. And like $8 bucks cheaper than buying at Sephora. This is the lightest color you can get, however, it is too dark for very fair skin like mine. It doesn&#x27;t look so noticeable until you go out in the sun. Shame they don&#x27;t make a lighter shade. I still wear it daily but if you don&#x27;t blend well it&#x27;s noticeable.</li>
            <li> Stays on better than the solution cream for breakouts.  All three of my teen boys love it.  THey rub it in enough to get rid of any sign of make up.  But it just stays on that greasy active boy skin longer for a more lasting effect.</li>
            <li> Great concealer and healer.</li>
            <li> The seller is no nice!!! My item was missing for some unknown reason and the seller was willing to reship one to me!!! So happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is pretty easy to use and it covers the redness effectively. I feel like I don&#x27;t need to make up since I have it.</li>
            <li> works well covers nice</li>
            <li> It was hard to find a concealer that was also a treatment.  This is what I was looking for!  It is a bit thick and sticky, but I&#x27;m getting used to it.</li>
            <li> My 15 year old son loves this and uses it daily.</li>
            <li> So, I am usually somewhat cheap when it comes to make up. I&#x27;ve recently had an epiphany to try quality over price. I don&#x27;t often get acne but when I do, I get rather dark red spots that are hard to cover up. After a bit of researching, I landed on the Murad product page. It seemed like a good buy though it was about 5 times the price of what I normally pay for this sort of thing. I must say I am not disappointed. It covers my red spots very well and also helps heal them acne. It&#x27;s the perfect color for my skin tone - I am very fair skinned. My only complaint is that it does not last all day, probably around 6-7 hours and you need another application. I have yet to find anything better.</li>
            <li> Tried this a half a year ago. I bought this assuming it would help my acne. It didn&#x27;t. My skin is red, with little scars and breakouts on my chin area, is dry in the winter, has an oily t-zone in the winter and summer, blackheads on my nose year round, and my cheeks are pretty much normal, with some occasional whiteheads. I used this to try to cover the little spot and scars on my chin. Yu can&#x27;t use this if you have an active whitedead or red bump because you will have to press hard to get this to go anywhere. I had to use a concealer brush, and even then, it would smear (kind of) onto my face, dry, and then not want to move. I could budge it a little with the brush, but other wise I had to press hard and irritate my bumps- which made it even worse. The Salycidic Acid did nothing for the existing spots, and it made the spots I put it on dry. The only pro to this for me and my skin is that it matched my tone well. It has a nice yellowundertone about it.   Please, if you have spots and/or acne, try a cream concealer. They are far better than hard sticks like this one. Physician&#x27;s Formula has a good one I use now.   Bottom line- it was not for my combo skin and made it more irritated.  Will not purchase the Murad Acne Treatment Concealer again. I am dissapointed that I shelled out 20 dollars ona tiny tube that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts and it has very good coverage. My one complaint is that the color is a little more yellow/orange than I expected. It does rub in, but I think I would like this product more with a more extensive variety of shades. I use other Murad products though and really trust the line, so I don&#x27;t plan on changing to another concealer.</li>
            <li> If you need a cover-up to hide blemishes over your make-up--then this is the one.  It goes on easily, is not greasy and does the job.&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure about the medicated aspect of the product, but for cosmetic purposes I would say it is a definite YES!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dry and looks flaky on the skin.  I prefer the &amp;#34;e.l.f.&amp;#34; brand &amp;#34;zit zapping concealer&amp;#34;.  You can get it at target, Walgreens, and most drugstores.  It&#x27;s only $5 or $6, and I like it better.</li>
            <li> this is a good product, helps heal scars and while helping acme go away and helps conceal the acme while healing. Will order again for this product. Thanks Mike</li>
            <li> Blends well and hides well, but carries the same problem as any other concealer in any price range: if you have dry, acne-prone skin and use this, or any concealer it seems, it&#x27;ll make any dry flaking on your face about ten times more visible, exfoliating and moisturizing beforehand be damned. But as I said, this is a problem with all concealers that I&#x27;ve ever tried. For the price though, I was hoping that this concealer would prove better than its cheaper counterparts, but as I&#x27;ve should have learned by now, there are no magic wands when it comes to problem skin.</li>
            <li> I love this concealer &amp; Amazon has the best price by far.</li>
            <li> Love it. Best concealer on the market. Helps with breakouts. Lasts all day.</li>
            <li> DO NOT USE THIS MURAD PRODUCT IF YOU ARE ALLERGIC TO ASPIRIN OR ANY OF ITS INGRIDIENTS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product as a part of Murad Adult Acne Treatment which I have terrible reactions to. It contained SALICYLIC ACID which the main metabolite of ASPIRIN. I only used it for a month. Reactions generally occur within a few hours of putting the cream on. The reaction includes;&lt;br /&gt;HIVES,&lt;br /&gt;ITCHY SKIN,&lt;br /&gt;SWELLING OF MY LIPS, MY TONGUE AND MY FACE,&lt;br /&gt;COUGHING, WHEEZING AND SHORTNESS OF BREATH&lt;br /&gt;AND THE WORST;&lt;br /&gt;ANAPHYLAXIS â€” a rare, life-threatening allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;Anaphylaxis requires an immediate trip to the emergency department and an injection of epinephrine. I was hospitilised 4 times in a month. Several blood samples and at the end doctors finally found why?? SALICYLIC ACID in the MURAD PRODUCTS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Murad should obliged to WARN CUSTOMERS WHO ARE ALLERGIC TO ASPIRIN SHOULD AVOID from this product line which ANY OF ITS INGRIDIENTS is SALICYLIC ACID.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT USE THIS MURAD PRODUCT IF YOU ARE ALLERGIC TO ASPIRIN OR ANY OF ITS INGRIDIENTS.</li>
            <li> I would like to start by saying I&#x27;m not certain this product really treats acne.  I always use concealers that claim to treat your acne because I feel they are at least unlikely to cause new acne.  That being said I&#x27;ve never put this on and suddenly my acne disappeared.  This concealer is a good product because it is highly pigmented and covers thoroughly with very little product.  My first stick of this lasted about 8 months.  I often buy the neutrogena \\&quot;acne treatment\\&quot; concealer.  It only costs about $10, but I use it way faster probably within two months and this murad product also provides better coverage.  I strongly recommend this prduct because it is long-lasting and provides supperior coverage.</li>
            <li> Dries chalky then makes my face oily. Doesn&#x27;t make me break out though! Lol</li>
            <li> I have been using this treatment concealer for a couple of years now. As soon as I feel a pimple coming on I put this on and it usually either prevents the pimple from showing up entirely or shortens the stay and lessens appearance of one and it covers any signs of redness very well. I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> when put on my face, after 3 or 4 hours, my face problem become serious. the Acne are bigger than before.</li>
            <li> Amazing concealar very thick, perfect for covering acne or pimples, In love with this Concealar!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for Neutrogena skin clearing concealer which was irritating my skin and causing breakouts. I expected something that would apply easily and blend well with my skin tone. What I did not expect was something that looks like a child&#x27;s crayon. When you apply it, there is a thick waxy deposit on the skin. Try as you might, you cannot blend it well with fingers or wash it off easily. The result is that there are light toned patches all over your face. Also the color tone is too dark for my Asian skin. It did not irritate my skin or cause breakouts. But that is the only plus. I would not waste my money on this.</li>
            <li> The main reason I continue to use this product every once in a while is because it is medicated and does not cause me to break out; however, as a concealer, it is definitely not the best. While it covers up redness, it also magnifies dry skin spots. In order to make it smooth, I have to use make-up primer, defeating the purpose of me using this product in order to not wear makeup. I still use it for under eye circles and as a bit of cover up whenever I go to the library or the gym (in other words, when I expect to not have to interact with others). It&#x27;s just alright.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know whats in this formula but it&#x27;s the only thing I can use directly on acne, for a pin point concealer. I put a little dab on my finger dip and tap it on top. It stays better than any expensive concealers I&#x27;ve used and is fabulous at reducing the red. It seems like if I use this stuff the zit will clear up much faster than if I don&#x27;t. I have no idea why and I haven&#x27;t looked too much into the ingredients, beyond the salicylic acid (which I know reduces inflammation and exfoliates, but I don&#x27;t know anything about the other ingredients). It is not meant for all over concealer--or at least it gets cakey if I use it like that, I only use it directly on the acne spots. I keep this in my emergency make up bag in my purse because in a pinch it will work great for anything on face and having the solid stick formula is very appealing to me for travelling and heat/cold exposure.</li>
            <li> I really do like this product!!!  I use it everyday!  It gives great coverage!  It&#x27;s great for acne, but also great for other uses!  I use it on blemishes, highlight, and even concealer!  I really recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you like it as much as I do! :)</li>
            <li> I found this stick when my sister was looking for an acne clearing concealer a few years back. I purchased one too. I have very sensitive skin and this is nice because it does not irritate my already sensitive skin when applied. It is a great color, blends easily and stays put most of the day. You can put makeup over it if you choose and it does not get cakey. I will continue to purchase this stick!</li>
            <li> this product is very good for dark spots, red spots and scars. I use it on pimples too if they are small enough to hide.</li>
            <li> I think my wife bought this, and since she is beautiful and always looks gorgeous, I think I love it.</li>
            <li> Really love this concealer for my acne blemishes and scars. I have had the same little tube for the past 8 months and there is still a little left with me using it almost daily.</li>
            <li> Second time I&#x27;ve bought this and I hope it isn&#x27;t discontinued.</li>
            <li> Really like this concealer-- it works really well at covering up blemishes, even on my pale skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I have yet to really feel like the salicylic acid is working and getting rid of them sooner...</li>
            <li> I used to swear by a zit cream/concealer by Charles of the Ritz, which is no longer available. This works as well or better. While drying out a zit, it conceals it and is hardly noticeable. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> This works just as I expected it too.  I use it all the time on little cover ups that are needed.</li>
            <li> It is the perfect shade for my extremely pale skin and stays on longer than most concealers. I am consistently pleased with Murad products and this one is just as good if not better than all of the others I have tried.</li>
            <li> Murad products are hit or miss for me-and this is definitely a hit! This is a salicylic stick, which will not treat all types of acne but because I usually only have bacterial acne-this works fairly well for me. Over the years I have tried a few different brands, and Murad and Proactiv are the two Concealers I like best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a creamy stick, and spreads fairly evenly over skin. I usually wear this over a moisturizer so it spreads a little better on the infected area. It does blend very well, and I don&#x27;t have trouble matching this to most different types of foundations that I would wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most salicylic acne treatments, I don&#x27;t know how well this actually &amp;#34;treats&amp;#34; the acne. Generally I use this because while I do not believe it is necessarily treating my acne-it certainly isn&#x27;t causing it any more irritation. However, when I have gone make-up free and used or used a more potent acne treatment, my acne clears faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin Type: 20-something, acne prone, sensitive, semi-pigmented, few lines.</li>
            <li> good product and fast delivery</li>
            <li> This concealer does its job pretty well. I apply it to any occasional acne that I get or any scars that I may have and then apply my foundation on top of it. I can&#x27;t say it makes a phenomenal difference but it is on the same level or better as other concealers in this price range. Also, most importantly, this is one of few concealers you will find that actually HELPS acne instead of just making it a thousand times worse. For this reason, I have to give it four stars, wouldn&#x27;t you say that is a rare find?</li>
            <li> Love it, just wish i bought the medium at first.</li>
            <li> Hides acne well but it does seem like it makes my pimples last longer than they usually would.</li>
            <li> Love this product but ordering did not give me the color options. They sent me Light and I needed medium. Of course sending it back is more expensive than the product itself so, it is my lost. :( Not fair.... It is a good product when the color is right.</li>
            <li> I literally received an empty box.</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin, and have tried many different acne products.  I&#x27;m finally getting results with the Murad line</li>
            <li> This is great! Covers up breakouts while preventing new ones. My skin has never been clearer since I started using this.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It feels great, has the exactly right amount of coverage, and i can wear it without worrying that my make up is causing breakouts. It&#x27;s always there for me when i need it. highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is an absolute must have product for me. Its two in one, concealer and acne spot treatment is the perfect combo!</li>
            <li> This product is a life saver!  I will get blemishes at the worst possible times and this product does a great job of making them invisible.  It blends with my skin color perfectly and can only be noticed if someone is looking really closely. It doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for making the blemish go away any faster, however it doesn&#x27;t make it any worse.</li>
            <li> This concealer provides good coverage and is very solid but blendable. The reason I won&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because if the pigment can cluster and cake if it begins to peel - not different from other heavier concelears in that regard. All of them do this. *sigh*</li>
            <li> I bought this item at a Sephora store after reading the positive reviews on Amazon but the result I got was rather disappointing. It did not provide adequate coverage that I had expected.  I applied multiple layers on the spot but the cream seemed to disappear quickly. Not only did it not cover the blemish well, it made the surrounding area look pigmented.  I like how it treats the acne/blemish but there are other products that offer similar medication and can cover better such as Clinique Acne Solution Clearing Concealer which works better for me.  The other thing I do appreciate about this product is how easy it can be used cuz the stick design.</li>
            <li> blends so easily! i feel good about what makeup im putting on my acne when i have this on. lasts forever! thought i would have to buy a new stick every few months but i&#x27;m about 1/2 done and it&#x27;s been 6 months!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  I&#x27;m a guy, and I use this to cover up pimples on my face.  Now I cannot attest to the effectiveness of the actual treatment in the concealer, I don&#x27;t know if it really helps clear up my acne, but that&#x27;s not the purpose I bought it for.  I have other productions I can put on at night for that.  What I do know is that it won&#x27;t further clog my pores.  It&#x27;s a great product when you have an especially red pimple (or post pimple scar) that there&#x27;s nothing you can do about and need to cover it up to go out.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a super light concealer, so if you&#x27;re very, very pale, i may be too dark. I have light to medium skin tone so it works perfectly for me. It&#x27;s easily blendable. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s great at actually getting rid of blemishes, but it is a great concealer so I use it for blemishes anyways.</li>
            <li> This concealer is perfect for anyone who breaks out- it has acne treatment in the concealer so you don&#x27;t need to feel guilty for putting makeup on your breakouts! I use this product religiously, and once I ordered it, it was shipped to my house in less than a week!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay not great for me though. I feel like it made my skin very dry and flaky when I would use it but not every one has the same skin type. Very good coverage overall!</li>
            <li> I find my skin actually clears up when I don&#x27;t wear makeup and let my skin be natural and breathe.  However, when I go out to meetings or wherever I do like to cover my blemishes.  This is a perfect cover up either alone or under more makeup. because it&#x27;s a concealer but also will help clear the blemishes.  Some concealers and makeup aggravate my skin and this doesn&#x27;t seem to cause a problem.</li>
            <li> Love it. I just have to put this on and i&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li> They not only effectively conceal blemishes, but they clear them up in a  relatively short period of time.  Great product</li>
            <li> This is one of the best concealers ever! I have combination-oily skin and never have to worry that covering up my zits will make them worse. This product seems to treat zits well while giving effective coverage (you can still see my problem areas if you look real close, but it&#x27;s better than going without. Also, I try to go minimalistic with makeup... I just use this and garnier BB Cream. It may cover better if you pile it on or apply other products over it).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much it actually removes acne, but it definitely goes on to the skin really smoothly and it&#x27;s overall a good concealer. It was a little too light for my skin color and I&#x27;m not that tan, so you might want to keep that in mind.</li>
            <li> Returned due to wrong item ordered.</li>
            <li> My daughter was use to using Lycogel Acne Control Camouflage for covering her acne spots. That line was discontinued, so I ordered this for her. She is unhappy with how it covers and how it blends. It looks like she&#x27;s trying to cover something up and it draws more attention to it. I can&#x27;t tell that it&#x27;s helped her skin that much. She really just has most of her breakouts on her forehead, but this makes it look like dots on her forehead. I was really disappointed, because I&#x27;ve used Murad moisturizers in the past and thought they were very good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing this product for years. One stick lasts me probably about 6 months and it is just fantastic!</li>
            <li> This product grew on me - when I first got it and applied it, I thought that the color match was way too orange and that the consistency was way too thick.  However, as I played with it a little more, I grew to love it.  I feel like it has improved my skin since I started using it.  My acne scars have faded considerably and I have been breaking out less in the places where I have used this.  My skin is very fair, sensitive, oily, and scars easily - kind of a nightmare!  As long as I use a light hand and don&#x27;t cake this on, I find that it works fantastically!  I am giving this 4 stars simply because the makeup stick itself broke inside of the packaging (it is still usable, but the \\&quot;stick\\&quot; is no longer attached to the base of the makeup packaging, so it shifts around on it&#x27;s own).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this concealer for years now and it works great for me. Does not cause skin irritation or breakouts and easy to apply. It covers light spots great but not darker spots so much. Only problem is you have to reapply it often as it comes right off.</li>
            <li> really good product!  love it!!!</li>
            <li> Does a very nice job of covering up acne w/out making it obvious</li>
            <li> This is the best medicated concealer I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;ve tried a lot as I am  almost 50 and have hade breakouts forever.  I don&#x27;t want to be caught without this.</li>
            <li> I love this product as both a blemish concealer and as a treatment for acne. It does a great job of blocking redness and camouflaging acne blemishes. When I take my makeup off at the end of the day my pimples are noticeably smaller and less red. Although I am noticing a difference in my pimples, this product does not treat them completely. I would find another product to use as a spot treatment and continue to use this as an everyday canceler.</li>
            <li> I like this product a whole lot.  It covers well,&lt;br /&gt;and I know it&#x27;s treating the problem too.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again.</li>
    </ol>
