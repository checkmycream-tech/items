            <li>This product has some amazing ingredients in it.  </li>
            <li>Plus it feels amazing.  </li>
            <li>All opinions are my own and are honest.</li>
            <li>I used this for a week before writing the review to give it my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of a kind in my opinion.</li>
            <li>and it smell really nice.</li>
            <li>look.&lt;br /&gt;Carol Rose</li>
            <li>It does feel really nice</li>
            <li>I did receive this at a reduced rate to try and give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>and this is my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>The product doesn&#x27;t absorb nicely into the skin...</li>
            <li>Smells nice, absorbs well, wrinkles are somewhat softer.</li>
            <li>Luxurious, effective serum.</li>
            <li>There is no odor (a good thing) and I am enjoying the results.</li>
            <li>Nice feel and the serum diminished puffiness, lightened the skin around my eyes and that was in minutes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very emollient, and feels wonderful under the eyes and over the orbital bone.</li>
            <li>Just started using the product and already loving it.</li>
            <li>Great product, item as described, very useful.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this wonderful product!</li>
            <li>Wow, this is beautifully packaged and &amp;#34;eye&amp;#34; anticipate loving it!  </li>
            <li>My under eye skin is very sensitive and this has worked wonderfully for me.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling moisturized and has a very light nice scent.</li>
            <li>It softens the skin around my eyes and does a good job at smoothing my fine lines.</li>
            <li>What also thrills me about this product is that all of its ingredients are completely natural and organic, so it&#x27;s perfect for those who have sensitive skin (and also perfect for those who do not!)  </li>
            <li>This is the best eye serum I have found that has 100% organic and natural</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled to have found this.</li>
            <li>But so far I&#x27;m impressed.  </li>
            <li>want to protect and nourish my very important asset:  my eyes, so I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li>Nourishing Organics and Botanicals in a silky smooth oil, with a light, pleasant botanical fragrance.  </li>
            <li>This is a really nice eye serum, it&#x27;s nourishing and helps with the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Immortelle&#x27; Organics is an exceedingly high quality brand that has beautifully formulated products like their skin toner that works well with this serum too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this product, i use it after ive put on my retinol so the area around my eyes is protected, in the morning</li>
            <li>i love the smell of the herbal flowery like scent.</li>
            <li>However, when a friend told me to try Immortelle, I was beyond satisfied.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Initially, I was a bit concerned that the product is recommended to be applied twice a day (morning and evening), but I have enjoyed applying it each time.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that the skin under my eyes is smoother and more supple.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fantastic product!</li>
            <li>This product is also probably one of the better non-toxic all organic ingredient eye serum that&#x27;s out on the market</li>
            <li>I really love this eye serum for its many healthy and beneficial attributes.</li>
            <li>my skin feels much better- even if it doesn&#x27;t look noticeably rejuvenated</li>
            <li>I love this eye serum.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not horrible, just a bit smelly (to me).</li>
            <li>great texture and smell and really moisturizes the eye area</li>
            <li>and I love the way it feels.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this serum.</li>
            <li>Nourishing, Moisturizing - makes eye area feel plump and smooth!</li>
            <li>I love the organic ingredients, safer for our skin.</li>
            <li>and I love it...</li>
            <li>I love all the products</li>
            <li>I am sure it will require more time to work to its fullest compactly in no time at all.</li>
            <li>I love this serum.</li>
            <li>I will update once I have had more time to test more.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s in liquid drop form</li>
            <li>Fantastic serum!</li>
            <li>It can&#x27;t get better than that :) My wrinkles around the eyes are gone :)</li>
            <li>Will try to give an update review sometime soon when I have more opportunity to use it.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>than much more costly products.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products over the years</li>
            <li>I love the feel of this.</li>
            <li>I love this eye serum.  </li>
            <li>It is most helpful for my morning puffy eyes.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>love this product..</li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>but I think I like it more around my lips</li>
            <li>is much better.  </li>
            <li>Most eye products sting and irritate my eyes, and seem to stay on the surface of my skin.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m sure that the results will continue to get better and better.</li>
            <li>and hopefully the improvement will become more visible.</li>
            <li>This product is fabulous and effective.  </li>
            <li>product feels great going on and absorbs into my skin really well.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels more plumped up - like it is rehydrated.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love the ingredients and packaging.</li>
            <li>I will keep trying to see if there is a way to use it that will work better for me.</li>
            <li>It does feel lovely when applied.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still using the product.....</li>
            <li>I try to get the products that doesn&#x27;t have many chemicals in them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>BUT THAT&#x27;S OKAY.</li>
            <li>MAKE SURE YOU DON&#x27;T PUT IT TOO CLOSE TO THE EYE</li>
            <li>I feel like my skin looks smoother and more youthful.</li>
            <li>I really love this.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>This is a high quality product at a great price</li>
            <li>Even with our dry weather my skin is in wonderful condition.</li>
            <li>goes on nicely, drys quickly and isn&#x27;t oily once it sets.</li>
            <li>With all organic ingredients it&#x27;s great for anyone looking for natural cosmetics and beauty without being a vegan or paleo diet soccer mom.</li>
            <li>It softens wrinkles feels lovely on and smells fabulous.</li>
            <li>I am extremely happy with the results I have seen thus far</li>
            <li>Really feels good.</li>
            <li>Love it, need more &amp; will order more soon ;-)</li>
            <li>came very quickly and was well wrapped.</li>
            <li>it absorb very quick and not oily.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and well packaged (no leaks or dribbles after use.</li>
            <li>Like the dropper, easy to use.</li>
            <li>She states it is easy to apply and non&#x3D;greasy.</li>
            <li>What makes this serum unique is that it has pumpkin seed oil and helichrysum, very rare to find in an eye serum and something that I would expect to jack the price up a bit more than it is here.</li>
            <li>The skin around my eyes feels firmer and the fine lines are diminishing.</li>
            <li>already my fine lines haven&#x27;t dissappeared yet</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any reduction of fine lines</li>
            <li>THE FINE LINES AND SUN SPOTS ARE DIMINISHING.  </li>
            <li>It goes on so smoothly and absorbs very quickly.  </li>
            <li>After one week, I could tell a difference in my fine lines and puffiness.</li>
            <li>Even after just a couple of days of use, I could notice a difference in the appearance of fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Soft, pleasant.</li>
            <li>Looking forward to smooth out fine lines.</li>
            <li>That is a huge plus in my book because I try to avoid toxic and synthetic ingredients.</li>
            <li>I can really smell the rose geranium - which is a light and soothingly feminine smell without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li>serum goes on smooth and cools the skin.</li>
            <li>It works on my eyes they are wrinkle free.</li>
            <li>but I have to say that this one has been a fabulous hydrator to my skin.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous product.</li>
            <li>Great for giving extra moisture around eyes</li>
            <li>Used this last night and woke up with great looking eyes.</li>
            <li>Has a very silky, oil texture and soaks in nicely.  </li>
            <li>It is important to me that a product absorbs and does not just sit on my skin or dissipates without giving me the moisture and desired result.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Am so pleased with how safe and gentle it is.</li>
            <li>Really excite, just use it last night &amp; it felt wonderful.</li>
            <li>I love this little jar of happiness!</li>
            <li>It is rich and silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>I love this eye serum because it is made from certified natural organic ingredients, it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes, it feels nice when I apply it and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Just started useing this, and I really really like the feel, to early to tell if it makes a difference, but it sure feels good, and does not bother my eyes.</li>
            <li>Plus it helps my concealer stay on and looking fresh all day!</li>
            <li>Excited to continue my usage and see the promised results</li>
            <li>It smells divine, and most of all, I love that it&#x27;s completely organic and non toxic.</li>
            <li>I love the high quality ingredients and how easily the product goes on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this eye serum for about 3 days so far, and I&#x27;m really enjoying it!  </li>
            <li>that around my eyes, I can really see the differece  in the fine lines around my lips getting smoother , I will keep trying it around my eyes and see what happen!</li>
            <li>This eye serum is easy to use and I notice results right away.  </li>
            <li>which goes far beliw the dermis for the cell regeneration and production of collagen and elastin for vitality and vigorous eyes for when aging eyes really matters!!!!!  </li>
            <li>I have a lot of them and this serum is working really well to lighten and reduce them - a huge bonus I wasn&#x27;t expecting!</li>
            <li>Love the earthy smell and how this keeps my undereye really moisturized.</li>
            <li>It is absolutely the most soothing product that I have used for my eye area.</li>
            <li>ok because the product really works.  </li>
            <li>I did not receive this product at a discount for my review, I purchased it at FULL price</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just not convinced that thick oils are the best for putting around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Falling in love with this eye product so far!!!</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s been a great product.</li>
            <li>Seems to soften fine lines &amp; don&#x27;t have to use much at all!</li>
            <li>Exactly product my fine lines around my eyes have gone or have been soften....</li>
            <li>The subtle fragrance is delightful as well.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I love the high quality organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>I love this new product I tried.</li>
            <li>I have tried many serums in the past and trust me I have had my fair share of eye water splashing....</li>
            <li>Very moisture and like the smell, not too strong</li>
            <li>It absorbed quickly this time, no problem.</li>
            <li>In only a couple of weeks that area is becoming softer and more supple.  </li>
            <li>It just takes a little bit and goes on smoothly with pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>The fact that it is organic oil is wonderful and probably more healthier for use around delicate eye areas than most other products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it personally and love how concentrated it is!</li>
            <li>Very calming and smooth around your eyes.  </li>
            <li>It has a light calming scent and is very soothing to use.</li>
            <li>and what we put on it is absorbed into our systems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just started using this product and so far I love it...</li>
            <li>love using this product because it contains 100% organic and all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I bought it more as a preventative measure because I&#x27;m only 29 and wrinkle free still.</li>
            <li>I love how soft my skin feels afterwords.</li>
            <li>I love the texture and that it is fast absorbing</li>
            <li>I like the way it minimizes my smile lines and moisturizes around my eyes.</li>
            <li>This serum is natural and I love that aspect, it is a serum</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve read many of the reviews so far and some say the product is too oily and didn&#x27;t absorb well.</li>
            <li>Took the advice of many reviewers who said that it stayed on top of the skin and was very oily and started out by just putting one drop under each eye, and found that that was not enough for me.</li>
            <li>I love that this product is all natural.</li>
            <li>serum has a delicious smelling floral tea aroma due to the blue chamomile.</li>
            <li>My eyes love it and never get swollen as with  many other eye cremes.</li>
            <li>I have only been using it for a week, so as far as the fine lines, I can&#x27;t say it works yet, but I am very pleased with the moisture it is providing around and on my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and she says it absorbs pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>It may not be a miracle worker right away for some</li>
            <li>It absorbs right in and leaves no oily or greasy feeling at all.</li>
            <li>I started using this serum and notice a difference right away.  </li>
            <li>I have used many different things over the years and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>So far I love it, it works very well.</li>
            <li>The crows feet (laugh lines I like to call them) have softened , my skin is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I like this eye serum very much.</li>
            <li>Very gentle on my eyes.</li>
            <li>when I first went to use it</li>
            <li>My favorite scent is the Blue Chamomile.</li>
            <li>It targets your fine lines and wrinkles, crow feet, black eye circles, eye puffiness, aging brown spots and for the most part it has even firmed my droopy eyelids.  </li>
            <li>You only need about one drop for both eyes - any more than that is way too oily for me.</li>
            <li>I find that when I only use one drop, it absorbs much better into my skin instead of just laying on the surface.</li>
            <li>really like how my eyes and laugh lines are disappearing.</li>
            <li>Will update later when I notice a difference :)</li>
            <li>I will say my eyes looks more refreshed the next morning after using it, but I just felt that it was oily.</li>
            <li>The first times I used this I was amazed...</li>
            <li>Its a serum made up of organic essential oils and they are known for their ability to &amp;#34;penetrate the skin&amp;#34; better than lotions, gels or creams.</li>
            <li>serum feels creamy, and for my first application I used one drop under each eye.</li>
            <li>Hope the company comes out with a whole face/neck moisturizer!</li>
            <li>THIS IS THE FIRST PRODUCT I CAN USE,</li>
            <li>Nourishing Eye Serum is Exactly as it states.  </li>
            <li>That is more than enough.  </li>
            <li>This serum stimulates the production of collagen thanks to the high amounts of vitamina, c, and e and antioxidants that combat aggressively the free radicals that is responsible for skin agin</li>
            <li>I am 72 years old and can see a significant improvement around my eyes.</li>
            <li>smell isn&#x27;t strong and doesn&#x27;t linger, but it definitely has the scent of essential oils which I love.</li>
            <li>It smells lovely, doesn&#x27;t irritate my (extremely) sensitive skin, &amp; leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>I did the first time, but it still felt really nourishing.</li>
            <li>They are loaded with vitamin a, c and zinc, omega 3,6, fatty acids and antioxidants and unlike most serums have the unique ability to penetrate the dermis  to increase cell regeneration and production of collagen and elastin.</li>
            <li>I saw a huge difference in less puffiness and my eyes brighter and fine lines softened.</li>
            <li>give a full review, but it&#x27;s gentle and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I wish it was odorless or at least had a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>I have large bags under each eye, so I am looking forward  to Product</li>
            <li>It feels smooth and silky on my skin and sinks in quickly.</li>
            <li>So far, I really like this eye serum, a lot!!  </li>
            <li>Although the cost is a bit high at first, I was amazing how little of the oil goes how</li>
            <li>And, I don&#x27;t waste any; I continue to rub any little bit of this wonderfully nourishing serum into my hands.</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend it to anyone looking for all natural products that want to stray from chemicals!!!!</li>
            <li>This product has really improved the texture around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>It feels ohhhh so very soothing and just an invigorating eye spa experience so to speak.</li>
            <li>I really like this eye serum</li>
            <li>Wish I would of thought to take before and after pictures because you can really see the difference.</li>
            <li>so it really doesn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li>Wife really loves it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>and I really like the way it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li>Very nice.will buy again.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing....</li>
            <li>This eye serum really works.  </li>
            <li>but I have to tell you that it really really hydrates</li>
            <li>Very soothing.</li>
            <li>but I can see how much my under eye area is moisturizedoing</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>so I confess to not knowing much about it.</li>
            <li>I really thought I noticed an immediate difference....</li>
            <li>I think the problem is people are applying too much</li>
            <li>I think how much you use and how often depends on your skin type.</li>
            <li>I will only use products on my face that are free of harmful chemicals, and this serum fits the bill.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>VERY NOURISHING FOR THE EYE.</li>
            <li>DON&#x27;T REALLY LIKE THE SMELL</li>
            <li>I have tried many natural eye creams and serums and this one works with lasting results.</li>
            <li>definitely feel the wrinkles are getting a rich moisturizer.</li>
            <li>she is extremely well satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>Many other reviews have stated that it works, so I&#x27;m looking forward to continued results.</li>
            <li>I am excited to continue to regularly use this product and see its effects on my skin!</li>
            <li>and I actually feel like this, plus the other face serum, makes a big difference in me having soft skin that looks and feels more healthy!</li>
            <li>I live on the beach and enjoy being outside in the sunshine.  </li>
            <li>The dry edge near my cheek bone that separates the skin on the face from the eye, now has more of an even tone to it.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that the dark spots around my eyes have diminished and my face has more of a glow and moisture.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to the whole anti aging scene</li>
            <li>What I do know is that I started using this eye serum a month and a half ago and the bags under my eyes are looking much better.</li>
            <li>It dissipates quickly after application for those concerned about such things.</li>
            <li>Overall, I highly encourage you to try Immortelle because my experience with them was nothing short of phenomenal.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this serum</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product if you are looking to get results.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This has to be magic in a little bottle.</li>
            <li>It helps my under eye bags so much and doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>but I really like it so far.</li>
            <li>While I have very oily skin all over my face for some reason the area directly under my eyes seems a bit drier and benefited from two drops in this area.</li>
            <li>I am 63 years old and have used so many, many expensive eye moisturizers-serums in my lifetime.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read that helichrysum essential oil is highly effective at reducing dark spots, age spots, sun spots...whatever you want to call them.</li>
            <li>this delicate, effective oil has exceeded all my expectations.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels more supple and soft, less puffiness too.</li>
            <li>I am 53 years old and people are telling me I look like I am in my 30&#x27;s!  </li>
            <li>This specific oil blends targets exactly what I am looking for - reducing puffiness and under eye circles.</li>
            <li>I will have to use it longer to see if it truly works, but so far I like it!</li>
            <li>My skin around my eyes is softer, less fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Morning puffiness and fine lines are less noticeable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always hesitant to put products on my face and near my eyes!..</li>
            <li>I think I was so amazed at the first time that I totally overlooked the smell.</li>
            <li>Just started using this product and it is amazing-my dark circles have almost disappeared and my concealer goes on so smoothly.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my eye area so incredibly soft!</li>
            <li>I was certain this product would make my eye area look oily and clog the pores under my eyes, but was very surprised that my skin soaked it up like a sponge and still, almost 2 weeks later, no clogged pores from usage.</li>
            <li>Those little fine lines are also improving.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed a significant difference in the appearance of dark circles and puffiness.</li>
            <li>I wish there was a different top on it - since I knocked it over and lost half of it.</li>
            <li>it goes on smooth, no creases, and leaves a little glow that keeps me smiling.</li>
            <li>I suggest you use less at first, start with only one drop for both eyes and see how quickly it absorbs into your skin.</li>
            <li>All natural within 2 days the wrinkles around my eyes started to diminish and my eyes felt healthier</li>
            <li>I was soooo surprised that it didn&#x27;t burn or irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li>although I haven&#x27;t seen very noticeable results in the short time I&#x27;ve been using it I have to say that</li>
            <li>So far, it seems to be working.</li>
            <li>The product is not drying like others I have tried and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>So far it is a 5 star because I can see improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s organic, so I am comfortable to apply it around my eyes everyday.</li>
            <li>It has cured the chapped area completely.  </li>
            <li>It makes them so soft.</li>
            <li>I bet if I could actually remember to use this every morning and night it would really help.</li>
            <li>For me with oily skin, one drop is enough and two drops is too much.</li>
            <li>AND FEELS SO NATURAL.  </li>
            <li>This really make my face glow and can&#x27;t wait to see final results.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a few weeks now and love how it feels on my skin (under my eyes and above lips).</li>
            <li>I saw improvement in puffiness and swelling too, and the fine lines around my eyes are less apparent, after about two weeks of use.</li>
            <li>after all I was expecting more of a thick serum than a oil.</li>
            <li>I am very please with the results: non greasy, dries flat-</li>
            <li>All organic, raw, gluten free and vegan.</li>
            <li>but it gives your skin a break from all the heavy chemicals in other more expensive facial care and is nice for anyone trying to give the skin under their eyes a little love and appreciation.</li>
            <li>It took about a minute to a minute and a half for the serum to be fully absorbed to the point where it did not feel oily at all to the touch.</li>
            <li>No other compensation was received.</li>
            <li>It has a fine and luxurious texture to it as you apply this enriching serum to the delicate surrounding areas of your eyes.</li>
            <li>This rich oil like serum feels very heavy when putting it on.</li>
            <li>The aroma is not overpowering and lasts for a little bit until the oil gets absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>I lightly dab under my eyes and up past the outside corner.  </li>
            <li>After only a weeks use, the fine lines around my eyes and lips (yes, and lips) are less defined and smoother, and I feel hydrated even after a long day.</li>
            <li>and so far I&#x27;ve seen definite change around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>the various floral scents- reminded me of an old lady.</li>
            <li>That was the first result I saw after beginning use of the serum, a reduction in the dark spots, caused by years of sun damage, around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Have only been using it for a week, but am liking it so far.</li>
            <li>The dropper could be a smaller size where the oil comes out for you only need such a tiny amount ant it seems to come out rather fast.</li>
            <li>I was expecting something a little lighter in texture, and it didn&#x27;t absorb as fast as I thought it would, but it did COMPLETELY absorb into my skin.</li>
            <li>Helichrysum is the ingredient responsible for the reduction of hyperpigmentation and therefore removing the dark brown spots,  on your skin.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t use it for too long, but so far I can see some difference in the skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li>, I know I did at first and had trouble getting it to fully</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to give a professional opinion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve dealt with other eye serums in the past, but, ultimately, none were effective when it came to minimizing my puffiness and dark circles.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product who values top quality facial products and who does not want to waste their money on products that don&#x27;t work or worse yet, can cause cancer.  </li>
            <li>I have to say that I had applied a bit too much on my eyelid and got a little into my eyes, thinking I would have to run to the bathroom to splash water on it  </li>
            <li>A little really does go along way</li>
            <li>Goes on oily but quickly soaks in, leaving my under eye area brighter with less signs of dark under eye circles.</li>
            <li>Have only used it for a few days, so hard top</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This product has some amazing ingredients in it.  </li>
            <li> Plus it feels amazing.  </li>
            <li> All opinions are my own and are honest.</li>
            <li> I used this for a week before writing the review to give it my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of a kind in my opinion.</li>
            <li> and it smell really nice.</li>
            <li> look.&lt;br /&gt;Carol Rose</li>
            <li> It does feel really nice</li>
            <li> I did receive this at a reduced rate to try and give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> and this is my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t absorb nicely into the skin...</li>
            <li> Smells nice, absorbs well, wrinkles are somewhat softer.</li>
            <li> Luxurious, effective serum.</li>
            <li> There is no odor (a good thing) and I am enjoying the results.</li>
            <li> Nice feel and the serum diminished puffiness, lightened the skin around my eyes and that was in minutes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very emollient, and feels wonderful under the eyes and over the orbital bone.</li>
            <li> Just started using the product and already loving it.</li>
            <li> Great product, item as described, very useful.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Wow, this is beautifully packaged and &amp;#34;eye&amp;#34; anticipate loving it!  </li>
            <li> My under eye skin is very sensitive and this has worked wonderfully for me.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling moisturized and has a very light nice scent.</li>
            <li> It softens the skin around my eyes and does a good job at smoothing my fine lines.</li>
            <li> What also thrills me about this product is that all of its ingredients are completely natural and organic, so it&#x27;s perfect for those who have sensitive skin (and also perfect for those who do not!)  </li>
            <li> This is the best eye serum I have found that has 100% organic and natural</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled to have found this.</li>
            <li> But so far I&#x27;m impressed.  </li>
            <li> want to protect and nourish my very important asset:  my eyes, so I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Nourishing Organics and Botanicals in a silky smooth oil, with a light, pleasant botanical fragrance.  </li>
            <li> This is a really nice eye serum, it&#x27;s nourishing and helps with the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Immortelle&#x27; Organics is an exceedingly high quality brand that has beautifully formulated products like their skin toner that works well with this serum too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love this product, i use it after ive put on my retinol so the area around my eyes is protected, in the morning</li>
            <li> i love the smell of the herbal flowery like scent.</li>
            <li> However, when a friend told me to try Immortelle, I was beyond satisfied.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Initially, I was a bit concerned that the product is recommended to be applied twice a day (morning and evening), but I have enjoyed applying it each time.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that the skin under my eyes is smoother and more supple.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> This product is also probably one of the better non-toxic all organic ingredient eye serum that&#x27;s out on the market</li>
            <li> I really love this eye serum for its many healthy and beneficial attributes.</li>
            <li> my skin feels much better- even if it doesn&#x27;t look noticeably rejuvenated</li>
            <li> I love this eye serum.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not horrible, just a bit smelly (to me).</li>
            <li> great texture and smell and really moisturizes the eye area</li>
            <li> and I love the way it feels.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this serum.</li>
            <li> Nourishing, Moisturizing - makes eye area feel plump and smooth!</li>
            <li> I love the organic ingredients, safer for our skin.</li>
            <li> and I love it...</li>
            <li> I love all the products</li>
            <li> I am sure it will require more time to work to its fullest compactly in no time at all.</li>
            <li> I love this serum.</li>
            <li> I will update once I have had more time to test more.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s in liquid drop form</li>
            <li> Fantastic serum!</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t get better than that :) My wrinkles around the eyes are gone :)</li>
            <li> Will try to give an update review sometime soon when I have more opportunity to use it.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> than much more costly products.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products over the years</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this.</li>
            <li> I love this eye serum.  </li>
            <li> It is most helpful for my morning puffy eyes.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> love this product..</li>
            <li> I love this.  </li>
            <li> but I think I like it more around my lips</li>
            <li> is much better.  </li>
            <li> Most eye products sting and irritate my eyes, and seem to stay on the surface of my skin.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m sure that the results will continue to get better and better.</li>
            <li> and hopefully the improvement will become more visible.</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous and effective.  </li>
            <li> product feels great going on and absorbs into my skin really well.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels more plumped up - like it is rehydrated.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Love the ingredients and packaging.</li>
            <li> I will keep trying to see if there is a way to use it that will work better for me.</li>
            <li> It does feel lovely when applied.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still using the product.....</li>
            <li> I try to get the products that doesn&#x27;t have many chemicals in them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> BUT THAT&#x27;S OKAY.</li>
            <li> MAKE SURE YOU DON&#x27;T PUT IT TOO CLOSE TO THE EYE</li>
            <li> I feel like my skin looks smoother and more youthful.</li>
            <li> I really love this.</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> This is a high quality product at a great price</li>
            <li> Even with our dry weather my skin is in wonderful condition.</li>
            <li> goes on nicely, drys quickly and isn&#x27;t oily once it sets.</li>
            <li> With all organic ingredients it&#x27;s great for anyone looking for natural cosmetics and beauty without being a vegan or paleo diet soccer mom.</li>
            <li> It softens wrinkles feels lovely on and smells fabulous.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with the results I have seen thus far</li>
            <li> Really feels good.</li>
            <li> Love it, need more &amp; will order more soon ;-)</li>
            <li> came very quickly and was well wrapped.</li>
            <li> it absorb very quick and not oily.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and well packaged (no leaks or dribbles after use.</li>
            <li> Like the dropper, easy to use.</li>
            <li> She states it is easy to apply and non&#x3D;greasy.</li>
            <li> What makes this serum unique is that it has pumpkin seed oil and helichrysum, very rare to find in an eye serum and something that I would expect to jack the price up a bit more than it is here.</li>
            <li> The skin around my eyes feels firmer and the fine lines are diminishing.</li>
            <li> already my fine lines haven&#x27;t dissappeared yet</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any reduction of fine lines</li>
            <li> THE FINE LINES AND SUN SPOTS ARE DIMINISHING.  </li>
            <li> It goes on so smoothly and absorbs very quickly.  </li>
            <li> After one week, I could tell a difference in my fine lines and puffiness.</li>
            <li> Even after just a couple of days of use, I could notice a difference in the appearance of fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Soft, pleasant.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to smooth out fine lines.</li>
            <li> That is a huge plus in my book because I try to avoid toxic and synthetic ingredients.</li>
            <li> I can really smell the rose geranium - which is a light and soothingly feminine smell without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li> serum goes on smooth and cools the skin.</li>
            <li> It works on my eyes they are wrinkle free.</li>
            <li> but I have to say that this one has been a fabulous hydrator to my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product.</li>
            <li> Great for giving extra moisture around eyes</li>
            <li> Used this last night and woke up with great looking eyes.</li>
            <li> Has a very silky, oil texture and soaks in nicely.  </li>
            <li> It is important to me that a product absorbs and does not just sit on my skin or dissipates without giving me the moisture and desired result.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Am so pleased with how safe and gentle it is.</li>
            <li> Really excite, just use it last night &amp; it felt wonderful.</li>
            <li> I love this little jar of happiness!</li>

            <li> I love this eye serum because it is made from certified natural organic ingredients, it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes, it feels nice when I apply it and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Just started useing this, and I really really like the feel, to early to tell if it makes a difference, but it sure feels good, and does not bother my eyes.</li>
            <li> Plus it helps my concealer stay on and looking fresh all day!</li>
            <li> Excited to continue my usage and see the promised results</li>
            <li> It smells divine, and most of all, I love that it&#x27;s completely organic and non toxic.</li>
            <li> I love the high quality ingredients and how easily the product goes on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eye serum for about 3 days so far, and I&#x27;m really enjoying it!  </li>
            <li> that around my eyes, I can really see the differece  in the fine lines around my lips getting smoother , I will keep trying it around my eyes and see what happen!</li>
            <li> This eye serum is easy to use and I notice results right away.  </li>

            <li> ok because the product really works.  </li>
            <li> I did not receive this product at a discount for my review, I purchased it at FULL price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not convinced that thick oils are the best for putting around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Falling in love with this eye product so far!!!</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s been a great product.</li>
            <li> Seems to soften fine lines &amp; don&#x27;t have to use much at all!</li>
            <li> Exactly product my fine lines around my eyes have gone or have been soften....</li>
            <li> The subtle fragrance is delightful as well.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I love the high quality organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> I love this new product I tried.</li>
            <li> I have tried many serums in the past and trust me I have had my fair share of eye water splashing....</li>
            <li> Very moisture and like the smell, not too strong</li>
            <li> It absorbed quickly this time, no problem.</li>
            <li> In only a couple of weeks that area is becoming softer and more supple.  </li>
            <li> It just takes a little bit and goes on smoothly with pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> The fact that it is organic oil is wonderful and probably more healthier for use around delicate eye areas than most other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it personally and love how concentrated it is!</li>
            <li> Very calming and smooth around your eyes.  </li>
            <li> It has a light calming scent and is very soothing to use.</li>
            <li> and what we put on it is absorbed into our systems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just started using this product and so far I love it...</li>
            <li> love using this product because it contains 100% organic and all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I bought it more as a preventative measure because I&#x27;m only 29 and wrinkle free still.</li>
            <li> I love how soft my skin feels afterwords.</li>
            <li> I love the texture and that it is fast absorbing</li>
            <li> I like the way it minimizes my smile lines and moisturizes around my eyes.</li>
            <li> This serum is natural and I love that aspect, it is a serum</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve read many of the reviews so far and some say the product is too oily and didn&#x27;t absorb well.</li>
            <li> Took the advice of many reviewers who said that it stayed on top of the skin and was very oily and started out by just putting one drop under each eye, and found that that was not enough for me.</li>
            <li> I love that this product is all natural.</li>
            <li> serum has a delicious smelling floral tea aroma due to the blue chamomile.</li>
            <li> My eyes love it and never get swollen as with  many other eye cremes.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a week, so as far as the fine lines, I can&#x27;t say it works yet, but I am very pleased with the moisture it is providing around and on my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and she says it absorbs pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> It may not be a miracle worker right away for some</li>
            <li> It absorbs right in and leaves no oily or greasy feeling at all.</li>
            <li> I started using this serum and notice a difference right away.  </li>
            <li> I have used many different things over the years and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> So far I love it, it works very well.</li>
            <li> The crows feet (laugh lines I like to call them) have softened , my skin is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I like this eye serum very much.</li>
            <li> Very gentle on my eyes.</li>
            <li> when I first went to use it</li>
            <li> My favorite scent is the Blue Chamomile.</li>
            <li> It targets your fine lines and wrinkles, crow feet, black eye circles, eye puffiness, aging brown spots and for the most part it has even firmed my droopy eyelids.  </li>
            <li> You only need about one drop for both eyes - any more than that is way too oily for me.</li>
            <li> I find that when I only use one drop, it absorbs much better into my skin instead of just laying on the surface.</li>
            <li> really like how my eyes and laugh lines are disappearing.</li>
            <li> Will update later when I notice a difference :)</li>
            <li> I will say my eyes looks more refreshed the next morning after using it, but I just felt that it was oily.</li>
            <li> The first times I used this I was amazed...</li>
            <li> Its a serum made up of organic essential oils and they are known for their ability to &amp;#34;penetrate the skin&amp;#34; better than lotions, gels or creams.</li>
            <li> serum feels creamy, and for my first application I used one drop under each eye.</li>
            <li> Hope the company comes out with a whole face/neck moisturizer!</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE FIRST PRODUCT I CAN USE,</li>
            <li> Nourishing Eye Serum is Exactly as it states.  </li>
            <li> That is more than enough.  </li>
            <li> This serum stimulates the production of collagen thanks to the high amounts of vitamina, c, and e and antioxidants that combat aggressively the free radicals that is responsible for skin agin</li>
            <li> I am 72 years old and can see a significant improvement around my eyes.</li>
            <li> smell isn&#x27;t strong and doesn&#x27;t linger, but it definitely has the scent of essential oils which I love.</li>
            <li> It smells lovely, doesn&#x27;t irritate my (extremely) sensitive skin, &amp; leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I did the first time, but it still felt really nourishing.</li>
            <li> They are loaded with vitamin a, c and zinc, omega 3,6, fatty acids and antioxidants and unlike most serums have the unique ability to penetrate the dermis  to increase cell regeneration and production of collagen and elastin.</li>
            <li> I saw a huge difference in less puffiness and my eyes brighter and fine lines softened.</li>
            <li> give a full review, but it&#x27;s gentle and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I wish it was odorless or at least had a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I have large bags under each eye, so I am looking forward  to Product</li>
            <li> It feels smooth and silky on my skin and sinks in quickly.</li>
            <li> So far, I really like this eye serum, a lot!!  </li>
            <li> Although the cost is a bit high at first, I was amazing how little of the oil goes how</li>
            <li> And, I don&#x27;t waste any; I continue to rub any little bit of this wonderfully nourishing serum into my hands.</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend it to anyone looking for all natural products that want to stray from chemicals!!!!</li>
            <li> This product has really improved the texture around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> It feels ohhhh so very soothing and just an invigorating eye spa experience so to speak.</li>
            <li> I really like this eye serum</li>
            <li> Wish I would of thought to take before and after pictures because you can really see the difference.</li>
            <li> so it really doesn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li> Wife really loves it.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> and I really like the way it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li> Very nice.will buy again.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing....</li>
            <li> This eye serum really works.  </li>
            <li> but I have to tell you that it really really hydrates</li>
            <li> Very soothing.</li>
            <li> but I can see how much my under eye area is moisturizedoing</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> so I confess to not knowing much about it.</li>
            <li> I really thought I noticed an immediate difference....</li>
            <li> I think the problem is people are applying too much</li>
            <li> I think how much you use and how often depends on your skin type.</li>
            <li> I will only use products on my face that are free of harmful chemicals, and this serum fits the bill.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> VERY NOURISHING FOR THE EYE.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T REALLY LIKE THE SMELL</li>
            <li> I have tried many natural eye creams and serums and this one works with lasting results.</li>
            <li> definitely feel the wrinkles are getting a rich moisturizer.</li>
            <li> she is extremely well satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li> Many other reviews have stated that it works, so I&#x27;m looking forward to continued results.</li>
            <li> I am excited to continue to regularly use this product and see its effects on my skin!</li>
            <li> and I actually feel like this, plus the other face serum, makes a big difference in me having soft skin that looks and feels more healthy!</li>
            <li> I live on the beach and enjoy being outside in the sunshine.  </li>
            <li> The dry edge near my cheek bone that separates the skin on the face from the eye, now has more of an even tone to it.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that the dark spots around my eyes have diminished and my face has more of a glow and moisture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the whole anti aging scene</li>
            <li> What I do know is that I started using this eye serum a month and a half ago and the bags under my eyes are looking much better.</li>
            <li> It dissipates quickly after application for those concerned about such things.</li>
            <li> Overall, I highly encourage you to try Immortelle because my experience with them was nothing short of phenomenal.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this serum</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product if you are looking to get results.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This has to be magic in a little bottle.</li>
            <li> It helps my under eye bags so much and doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> but I really like it so far.</li>
            <li> While I have very oily skin all over my face for some reason the area directly under my eyes seems a bit drier and benefited from two drops in this area.</li>
            <li> I am 63 years old and have used so many, many expensive eye moisturizers-serums in my lifetime.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that helichrysum essential oil is highly effective at reducing dark spots, age spots, sun spots...whatever you want to call them.</li>
            <li> this delicate, effective oil has exceeded all my expectations.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels more supple and soft, less puffiness too.</li>
            <li> I am 53 years old and people are telling me I look like I am in my 30&#x27;s!  </li>
            <li> This specific oil blends targets exactly what I am looking for - reducing puffiness and under eye circles.</li>
            <li> I will have to use it longer to see if it truly works, but so far I like it!</li>
            <li> My skin around my eyes is softer, less fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Morning puffiness and fine lines are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always hesitant to put products on my face and near my eyes!..</li>
            <li> I think I was so amazed at the first time that I totally overlooked the smell.</li>
            <li> Just started using this product and it is amazing-my dark circles have almost disappeared and my concealer goes on so smoothly.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my eye area so incredibly soft!</li>
            <li> I was certain this product would make my eye area look oily and clog the pores under my eyes, but was very surprised that my skin soaked it up like a sponge and still, almost 2 weeks later, no clogged pores from usage.</li>
            <li> Those little fine lines are also improving.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed a significant difference in the appearance of dark circles and puffiness.</li>
            <li> I wish there was a different top on it - since I knocked it over and lost half of it.</li>
            <li> it goes on smooth, no creases, and leaves a little glow that keeps me smiling.</li>
            <li> I suggest you use less at first, start with only one drop for both eyes and see how quickly it absorbs into your skin.</li>
            <li> All natural within 2 days the wrinkles around my eyes started to diminish and my eyes felt healthier</li>
            <li> I was soooo surprised that it didn&#x27;t burn or irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> although I haven&#x27;t seen very noticeable results in the short time I&#x27;ve been using it I have to say that</li>
            <li> So far, it seems to be working.</li>
            <li> The product is not drying like others I have tried and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> So far it is a 5 star because I can see improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s organic, so I am comfortable to apply it around my eyes everyday.</li>
            <li> It has cured the chapped area completely.  </li>
            <li> It makes them so soft.</li>
            <li> I bet if I could actually remember to use this every morning and night it would really help.</li>
            <li> For me with oily skin, one drop is enough and two drops is too much.</li>
            <li> AND FEELS SO NATURAL.  </li>
            <li> This really make my face glow and can&#x27;t wait to see final results.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks now and love how it feels on my skin (under my eyes and above lips).</li>
            <li> I saw improvement in puffiness and swelling too, and the fine lines around my eyes are less apparent, after about two weeks of use.</li>
            <li> after all I was expecting more of a thick serum than a oil.</li>
            <li> I am very please with the results: non greasy, dries flat-</li>
            <li> All organic, raw, gluten free and vegan.</li>
            <li> but it gives your skin a break from all the heavy chemicals in other more expensive facial care and is nice for anyone trying to give the skin under their eyes a little love and appreciation.</li>
            <li> It took about a minute to a minute and a half for the serum to be fully absorbed to the point where it did not feel oily at all to the touch.</li>
            <li> No other compensation was received.</li>
            <li> It has a fine and luxurious texture to it as you apply this enriching serum to the delicate surrounding areas of your eyes.</li>
            <li> This rich oil like serum feels very heavy when putting it on.</li>
            <li> The aroma is not overpowering and lasts for a little bit until the oil gets absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> I lightly dab under my eyes and up past the outside corner.  </li>
            <li> After only a weeks use, the fine lines around my eyes and lips (yes, and lips) are less defined and smoother, and I feel hydrated even after a long day.</li>
            <li> and so far I&#x27;ve seen definite change around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> the various floral scents- reminded me of an old lady.</li>
            <li> That was the first result I saw after beginning use of the serum, a reduction in the dark spots, caused by years of sun damage, around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Have only been using it for a week, but am liking it so far.</li>
            <li> The dropper could be a smaller size where the oil comes out for you only need such a tiny amount ant it seems to come out rather fast.</li>
            <li> I was expecting something a little lighter in texture, and it didn&#x27;t absorb as fast as I thought it would, but it did COMPLETELY absorb into my skin.</li>
            <li> Helichrysum is the ingredient responsible for the reduction of hyperpigmentation and therefore removing the dark brown spots,  on your skin.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t use it for too long, but so far I can see some difference in the skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li> , I know I did at first and had trouble getting it to fully</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to give a professional opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dealt with other eye serums in the past, but, ultimately, none were effective when it came to minimizing my puffiness and dark circles.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product who values top quality facial products and who does not want to waste their money on products that don&#x27;t work or worse yet, can cause cancer.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that I had applied a bit too much on my eyelid and got a little into my eyes, thinking I would have to run to the bathroom to splash water on it  </li>
            <li> A little really does go along way</li>
            <li> Goes on oily but quickly soaks in, leaving my under eye area brighter with less signs of dark under eye circles.</li>
            <li> Have only used it for a few days, so hard top</li>
            <li> Dark circles is fading and my fine lines around my eyes are hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li> Other oils in there like pumpkin seed, rosehip, castor, and safflower are all packed with naturally occurring vitamins and</li>
            <li> At first I had a hard time with the scent of the product (I have fragrance sensitivity ), but have gotten use to it.  </li>
            <li> It got worse when I was pregnant with my second son</li>
            <li> I can only use it at night because it takes too long to absorb.</li>
            <li> I have only had it for a few days, however i like it so far.  </li>
            <li> But I was very surprised that this serum has pumpkin seed oil because this oil is loaded with vitamin a, c and zinc, omega 3,6, fatty acids and antioxidants  </li>
            <li> You just need a drop for both eyes, so this will last a long time!!</li>
            <li> It takes long time to absorb.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been using long</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not nearly as noticeable.</li>
            <li> so it goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;It actually delivers on reducing under eye swelling, wrinkles, and dark circles due to the helichrysum italicum and blue chamomile essential oils in the product which give it its anti inflammatory and skin regenerating properties.</li>
            <li> Overall, my eyes have less lines and look younger!</li>
            <li> But you use so little of the product anyway, so it only has an odor when you initially apply it.</li>
            <li> My skin is SO DRY</li>
            <li> I have noticed the dry skin around the bottom of my eyes</li>
            <li> I wanted something to hydrate the skin below my eyes because sometimes they were dry in the morning which made my make up cake and enhanced any wrinkles.</li>
            <li> however I have dry skin around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I gave this product a 4 star rating only because I have not noticed a change in the dark circles.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and maybe just need to use a very small drop spread only under my eye and not on the eyelid.</li>
            <li> When all the swollen went down I had wrinkles and a big bag under my eye</li>
            <li> It only takes a little of this product to go a long way.</li>
            <li> I use it only at night and my eyes are less swollen in the morning.</li>
            <li> You only need such a small amount of this, you dont need a &amp;#34;puddle&amp;#34; size.</li>
            <li> My friend has very dry skin</li>
            <li> You only need a little and it does</li>
            <li> I think it might take a little longer to see results for my crows feet that are starting.  </li>
            <li> but I only use a little bit</li>
            <li> I have only been using for a little while</li>
            <li> Keep in mind though it only takes a little bit</li>
            <li> Sometimes with natural products they take a bit longer to show noticeable results  (at least in my experience).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days</li>
            <li> A few drops will cover your eyes &amp; entire face!</li>
            <li> I place a tiny drop of the oil on one index finger and then dab a little on the other index finger and dab some under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Within two weeks I saw the dark spots on the rest of my face begin to fade as well, while it continued to work on the skin around my eyes on the loose skin and crepe like wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> have only been using it for a few days, so I haven&#x27;t noticed any  improvement in the dark under eye circles (toddler running around the house all day).</li>
            <li> and that is what I typically look for because my skin is really dry.  </li>
            <li> I typically use it only at night because it&#x27;s a little greasy for the day</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this.</li>
            <li> It takes so little of the oil blend to go a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long ways with this serum, so you don&#x27;t need to use a lot.  </li>
            <li> I put this under all other serum and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Helps to reduce some of the eye puffiness I&#x27;ve had due to allergies.</li>
            <li> Works well and no stinging or burning like I get from other eye creams.</li>
            <li> I have a skin care routine that I have followed religiously for the past 20 years using a well-known non-retail store brand.  </li>
            <li> It might be that in a couple of months, I will notice the other benefits that the product states.  </li>
            <li> A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY!</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s not the least expensive out there, but it is worth every penny to me!</li>
            <li> My dark circles are still there thou...</li>
            <li> Almost immediately after applying it, day or night, I noticed a difference, and with continued use, I noticed a gradual decrease with my dark circles.  </li>
            <li> and it is already helping my crows feet and dark circles.  </li>
            <li> I still have dark circles and some crown feet</li>
            <li> I work nights and often have bags and dark circles on my eyes.</li>
            <li> My eyes are always puffy and I have dark circles.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dark circles under my eyes</li>
            <li> so i can&#x27;t comment on that, but my thinking is if it&#x27;s working to reduce dark spots on the side of my face and neck, why wouldn&#x27;t it work to reduce dark under eye circles?</li>
            <li> and I looked a whole lot less tired!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for about 2 weeks at night and have noticed that my puffy eyes have gone down a bit.  </li>
            <li> WAIT TO TRY OTHER PRODUCTS FROM THIS MANUFACTURER!  </li>
            <li> I have noticed less dark circles under my eyes as well.  </li>
            <li> I used it in very small amounts, mixed with my sunscreen in the morning and with my moisturizer at night, and it did not cause me to have any breakouts.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly, not oily.</li>
            <li> or so I can see a slight improvement of my skin.</li>
            <li> My eyes are also less puffy.</li>
            <li> The puffiness and slight lines around my eyes go away after applying this product.  </li>
            <li> but my eyes look less wrinkled.</li>
            <li> I have tried it a few times and have felt that it left my area under my eye feeling sticky with thick oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that the dark circles are diminishing and my skin seems brighter, overall looking and feeling less tired.  </li>
            <li> My dark circles are gone!</li>
            <li> therefore it gets a little greasy around the eyes.  </li>
            <li> believe you will be amazed of the difference you will feel and see once you have used this serum for a little while.</li>
            <li> I really like the ingredients used and the lack of dangerous chemicals.</li>
            <li> Just use it for a few days</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly, no offensive odor.</li>
            <li> Over the past month i see a difference in the puffiness under my eyes and the dark circles faded.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product on my under eye area for a few days now</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> Tried for a few days, but felt a bit oily.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it and will update my comment after using a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Noticed improvement around my eyes within a few days.</li>
            <li> Look forward to seeing results months down the road!!</li>
            <li> A small amount goes along way.</li>
            <li> Sure beats all those products with the nasty chemicals!!</li>
            <li> Visible difference in just a few days!</li>
            <li> but there may be some small reduction of darkness under the eyes.</li>
            <li> It is not a overwhelming smell.</li>
            <li> When you look at the bottle ,you think that is a small bottle.</li>
            <li> When I wake my under eyes are lesser creepy, and I swear the bags are diminishing</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of the smell!</li>
            <li> Sort of a tingling sensation not intense but very subtle.  </li>
            <li> A little secret, I sometimes use this on my hands.</li>
            <li> If I had one negative thing, it would be the smell.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it would cause breakouts, but it hasn&#x27;t, so I&#x27;ve started smoothing a couple drops over my entire face and neck for added moisture.</li>
            <li> I like to use products for a couple weeks at least, before I review and</li>
            <li> Even though it doesn&#x27;t say, I also use one drop on and around the delicate lip area.  </li>
            <li> Lately though, I have been concerned about some of the chemicals in products.</li>
            <li> I did not like how thick and oily it felt, so</li>
            <li> I use a small amount under my eyes at night and it does the trick!</li>
            <li> This has helped with small wrinkles and darkness but trust me on this--use a very small amount!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seriously a miracle in a little bottle!!!</li>
            <li> I am getting hardly any sleep!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m slowly but surly seeing a difference under my eyes!</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and flake really bad.</li>
            <li> I used it on my tired eyes</li>
            <li> It takes time to see the improvement, but after a while skin becomes fire and bad marks are disappearing...</li>
            <li> and I was so frustrated by it.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> given the rave reviews, I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> So ugly!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this product, i use it after ive put on my retinol so the area around my eyes is protected, in the morning i wake up looking well rested and no lines on my face!</li>
            <li> Just started useing this, and I really really like the feel, to early to tell if it makes a difference, but it sure feels good, and does not bother my eyes.</li>
            <li> great product. No &amp;#34;aftersmell&amp;#34; or unwanted extra shines. Soft, pleasant. My dark circles are still there thou...may be it is too soon to judge.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this. I only use it at bed time but it feels so great when I use it. Sort of a tingling sensation not intense but very subtle.  I really love this stuff! I don&#x27;t like the way my mineral powder cakes around it so I stopped using this during the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this product five stars because I did in fact see a difference after just one day. I applied it in the morning and at night, just before bed. I did not like how thick and oily it felt, so I will continue to only apply at night.</li>
            <li> Love the earthy smell and how this keeps my undereye really moisturized.</li>
            <li> At first I had a hard time with the scent of the product (I have fragrance sensitivity ), but have gotten use to it.  Haven&#x27;t noticed any visible changes but figure you have to give it time.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a significant difference in the appearance of dark circles and puffiness. The skin around my eyes feels firmer and the fine lines are diminishing. Great product!</li>
            <li> This rich oil like serum feels very heavy when putting it on. i love the smell of the herbal flowery like scent. definitely feel the wrinkles are getting a rich moisturizer. I put this under all other serum and moisturizer. Falling in love with this eye product so far!!!</li>
            <li> This product has really improved the texture around my eyes.  I am 53 years old and people are telling me I look like I am in my 30&#x27;s!  I highly recommend this product who values top quality facial products and who does not want to waste their money on products that don&#x27;t work or worse yet, can cause cancer.  Our skin is the largest organ we have and what we put on it is absorbed into our systems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to protect and nourish my very important asset:  my eyes, so I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with my purchase, thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dealt with other eye serums in the past, but, ultimately, none were effective when it came to minimizing my puffiness and dark circles.  However, when a friend told me to try Immortelle, I was beyond satisfied.  Almost immediately after applying it, day or night, I noticed a difference, and with continued use, I noticed a gradual decrease with my dark circles.  What also thrills me about this product is that all of its ingredients are completely natural and organic, so it&#x27;s perfect for those who have sensitive skin (and also perfect for those who do not!)  The serum is an oil, so only a dab or two is necessary for each eye.  Overall, I highly encourage you to try Immortelle because my experience with them was nothing short of phenomenal.</li>
            <li> Great product, and great customer service</li>
            <li> My skin looks &amp; feels great. Even with our dry weather my skin is in wonderful condition. I use a small amount under my eyes at night and it does the trick!</li>
            <li> I just started using this product and so far I love it... and it smells awesome, too!</li>
            <li> when I first went to use it I had doubts, after all I was expecting more of a thick serum than a oil. I put 2 drops on my fingers and rubbed them together than applied to my eye lids and surrounding skin. I was certain this product would make my eye area look oily and clog the pores under my eyes, but was very surprised that my skin soaked it up like a sponge and still, almost 2 weeks later, no clogged pores from usage. I&#x27;ve noticed that the dark circles are diminishing and my skin seems brighter, overall looking and feeling less tired.  A MUST try!!</li>
            <li> I am very impressed that an eye serum has 100% organic oils. That is a huge plus in my book because I try to avoid toxic and synthetic ingredients. The combination of oils create a pleasant aroma. The aroma is not overpowering and lasts for a little bit until the oil gets absorbed into the skin. My favorite scent is the Blue Chamomile. So pleasant and inviting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially, I was a bit concerned that the product is recommended to be applied twice a day (morning and evening), but I have enjoyed applying it each time. It takes so little of the oil blend to go a long way. I see this eye serum lasting me for quite some time. I place a tiny drop of the oil on one index finger and then dab a little on the other index finger and dab some under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using it for a few days, so I haven&#x27;t noticed any  improvement in the dark under eye circles (toddler running around the house all day). I have noticed that the skin under my eyes is smoother and more supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love using this product because it contains 100% organic and all natural ingredients. This specific oil blends targets exactly what I am looking for - reducing puffiness and under eye circles. The product is easy to use and smells great. This is the best eye serum I have found that has 100% organic and natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to continue to use this product and seeing the results. I would purchase this product again. Although the cost is a bit high at first, I was amazing how little of the oil goes how far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received the product to facilitate this review. No other compensation was received. All opinions are my own and are honest.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product! All natural within 2 days the wrinkles around my eyes started to diminish and my eyes felt healthier and I looked a whole lot less tired! I highly reccomend it to anyone looking for all natural products that want to stray from chemicals!!!!</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s giving this five stars. I would give it five but I feel it tends to get overlooked. I didn&#x27;t get a discount to review this product and didn&#x27;t buy it on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum has a delicious smelling floral tea aroma due to the blue chamomile. With all organic ingredients it&#x27;s great for anyone looking for natural cosmetics and beauty without being a vegan or paleo diet soccer mom. This product is also probably one of the better non-toxic all organic ingredient eye serum that&#x27;s out on the market right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It actually delivers on reducing under eye swelling, wrinkles, and dark circles due to the helichrysum italicum and blue chamomile essential oils in the product which give it its anti inflammatory and skin regenerating properties. Blue chamomile is also an anti-depressant and stress reliever. Other oils in there like pumpkin seed, rosehip, castor, and safflower are all packed with naturally occurring vitamins and antioxidants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum goes on smooth and cools the skin. It may not be a miracle worker right away for some but it gives your skin a break from all the heavy chemicals in other more expensive facial care and is nice for anyone trying to give the skin under their eyes a little love and appreciation.</li>
            <li> The best eye serum that I ever purchased.</li>
            <li> I really love this eye serum for its many healthy and beneficial attributes. It has a fine and luxurious texture to it as you apply this enriching serum to the delicate surrounding areas of your eyes. It feels ohhhh so very soothing and just an invigorating eye spa experience so to speak. It is lightweight but very effective. It targets your fine lines and wrinkles, crow feet, black eye circles, eye puffiness, aging brown spots and for the most part it has even firmed my droopy eyelids.  I have to say that I had applied a bit too much on my eyelid and got a little into my eyes, thinking I would have to run to the bathroom to splash water on it  I was soooo surprised that it didn&#x27;t burn or irritate my eyes. I have tried many serums in the past and trust me I have had my fair share of eye water splashing....lol. This serum stimulates the production of collagen thanks to the high amounts of vitamina, c, and e and antioxidants that combat aggressively the free radicals that is responsible for skin agin and oh yes the wrinkles:((((    Rosehip fully hydrates and moisturizes your skin deep to give your skin radiance and a youthful and healthier apperance. But I was very surprised that this serum has pumpkin seed oil because this oil is loaded with vitamin a, c and zinc, omega 3,6, fatty acids and antioxidants  which goes far beliw the dermis for the cell regeneration and production of collagen and elastin for vitality and vigorous eyes for when aging eyes really matters!!!!!  I highly recommend this serum your eyes will look more healthier than ever before guaranteed!!!!!</li>
            <li> It is rich,you only need a drop,this will go along way..</li>
            <li> Very good for my puffiness. My dark circles are gone!</li>
            <li> I really like this eye serum although I haven&#x27;t seen very noticeable results in the short time I&#x27;ve been using it I have to say that my after using it my skin feels much better- even if it doesn&#x27;t look noticeably rejuvenated (I haven&#x27;t given up hope that with continued use I will see results). I really like the ingredients used and the lack of dangerous chemicals. Sometimes with natural products they take a bit longer to show noticeable results  (at least in my experience). The serum has a scent which might be bothersome to those with sensitivities but personally I like the smell. It dissipates quickly after application for those concerned about such things. Overall, I like the serum and will continue to use it daily!</li>
            <li> Very calming and smooth around your eyes.  I have large bags under each eye, so I am looking forward  to Product came very quickly and was well wrapped.</li>
            <li> So far, it seems to be working. I like it.</li>
            <li> I love this eye serum. it absorb very quick and not oily. Looking forward to smooth out fine lines.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too oily for me, but  it works to moisturize my eye areas.</li>
            <li> Too oily, to use around eyes. I use it on my lips at night. The scent takes getting used to.</li>
            <li> Great product. I can see a difference already after using a week.</li>
            <li> I just rec&#x27;d this eye serum and it is already helping my crows feet and dark circles.  It feels quite luxurious on the face and one drop goes along way.  The fact that it is organic oil is wonderful and probably more healthier for use around delicate eye areas than most other products.</li>
            <li> I like this eye serum very much. You only need about one drop for both eyes - any more than that is way too oily for me. I find that when I only use one drop, it absorbs much better into my skin instead of just laying on the surface. If I had one negative thing, it would be the smell. I wish it was odorless or at least had a pleasant smell. But you use so little of the product anyway, so it only has an odor when you initially apply it. It&#x27;s not horrible, just a bit smelly (to me). Someone else may not even be bothered by it. Definitely try it and I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as described</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product. It is an amazing product. I am 72 years old and can see a significant improvement around my eyes. I can only imagine how well this product works on younger skin. Definitely will purchase again.</li>
            <li> great texture and smell and really moisturizes the eye area</li>
            <li> The product arrived well packages and on time.  I have only had it for a few days, however i like it so far.  It is easy to use and well packaged (no leaks or dribbles after use.</li>
            <li> Works great!! Love it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days and I love the way it feels.  I&#x27;ll keep you posted on the outcome.</li>
            <li> This has to be magic in a little bottle. Goes on oily but quickly soaks in, leaving my under eye area brighter with less signs of dark under eye circles. I used this for a week before writing the review to give it my honest opinion. It&#x27;s one of a kind in my opinion. I have tried many natural eye creams and serums and this one works with lasting results. Wish I would of thought to take before and after pictures because you can really see the difference.</li>
            <li> Great Product!! I bought this for my wife and she love&#x27;s it! works well and you could see the difference in 1-2 days!... Thx</li>
            <li> Just use it for a few days and I think this stuff works! Not greasy at all,love it.</li>
            <li> Really feels good. I see the difference. .I really like how my eyes and laugh lines are disappearing. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I used it on my tired eyes and I have to say that the dryness around my eyes is diminished drastically. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this serum. It feels smooth and silky on my skin and sinks in quickly. I was afraid it would cause breakouts, but it hasn&#x27;t, so I&#x27;ve started smoothing a couple drops over my entire face and neck for added moisture. Great product!</li>
            <li> Love this product! I have used many different things over the years and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> Love it, need more &amp; will order more soon ;-)</li>
            <li> Nourishing, Moisturizing - makes eye area feel plump and smooth!</li>
            <li> I recently saw a movie on IMAX. All the actors looked great until they showed a close up and you could see the bags and wrinkles under their eyes. So ugly! I went back home and I purchased this product. I bought it more as a preventative measure because I&#x27;m only 29 and wrinkle free still. I use it only at night and my eyes are less swollen in the morning. I also think my skin looks brighter and it smell really nice. I will definitely continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Very gentle on my eyes. I love the organic ingredients, safer for our skin. It&#x27;s not too oily, enough to keep skin around eyes moist and reduce wrinkles appearance&lt;br /&gt;Hope to see the result soon</li>
            <li> I think, I cannot wear this product as when I apply it to my lower eyelid as a short time later my eyes drain and become watery and then my nose begins to run also.</li>
            <li> Tiny bottle with a big punch!!! Absorbs quickly, not oily.</li>
            <li> I started using the Nourishing Eye Serum and I love it...It does what it says and it works...Dark circles is fading and my fine lines around my eyes are hardly noticeable. I finally found a product that works....Thank You Immortelle&#x27; Organics. Nourishing Eye Serum will only be the one for me.</li>
            <li> I use this at night. It works on my eyes they are wrinkle free. i had a allergy attack that made my eyes very big and puffy. When all the swollen went down I had wrinkles and a big bag under my eye now I don&#x27;t have that anymore. i did get this to review</li>
            <li> The product is not drying like others I have tried and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of the smell!</li>
            <li> After using the Nourishing eye serum, the finer lines under my eyes have disappeared. The dry edge near my cheek bone that separates the skin on the face from the eye, now has more of an even tone to it. I love all the products but I have to say that this one has been a fabulous hydrator to my skin. Imagine a plant that has wilted and then it gets watered and you come back to see that it is all refreshed. Thats how it makes me feel and look.&lt;br /&gt;Carol Rose</li>
            <li> Great stuff, but felt oily, but worked like it should. Wife loves it!</li>
            <li> While I have only had this for a week or so I can see a slight improvement of my skin. I am sure it will require more time to work to its fullest compactly in no time at all. So far it is a 5 star because I can see improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly, no offensive odor. I will have to use it longer to see if it truly works, but so far I like it!</li>
            <li> Smells great and feels amazing on my skin! Will update later when I notice a difference :)</li>
            <li> I think this is an excellent product for the eye area.  You only need a little and it does it&#x27;s job well.</li>
            <li> I really love this!!!  It is absolutely the most soothing product that I have used for my eye area. It is instantly hydrating. I noticed that my concealer went on easier. My eyes are also less puffy. I use it at night also before I go to bed.  Will absolutely keep purchasing this product!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for about 2 weeks at night and have noticed that my puffy eyes have gone down a bit.  I think it might take a little longer to see results for my crows feet that are starting.  I do not like the smell but I only use a little bit so it really doesn&#x27;t bother me.  It does feel really nice and I will continue to use and update this review if I see results on my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Too oily.  It takes long time to absorb.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t use it for too long, but so far I can see some difference in the skin around my eyes. It feela softer and looks brighter. I still have dark circles and some crown feet but it&#x27;s too soon to tell.</li>
            <li> A great product.  Nice surprise!</li>
            <li> This is a very good eye serum. Over the past month i see a difference in the puffiness under my eyes and the dark circles faded. You only need such a small amount of this, you dont need a &amp;#34;puddle&amp;#34; size. It has not irritated my skin, meaning no itching, no burning, no redness. I cant wait to see how much more difference I see in another month!</li>
            <li> I love this serum. Noticable difference in about a week!</li>
            <li> So far I love it, it works very well. A small amount goes along way. My skin looks very healthy.</li>
            <li> Great product! Seems to soften fine lines &amp; don&#x27;t have to use much at all! Look forward to seeing results months down the road!!</li>
            <li> Wife really loves it.  Thanks</li>
            <li> This serum leaves the skin around my eyes feeling moisturized but not greasy.  It works as described.  Happy with this.</li>
            <li> Good eye serum. It&#x27;s organic, so I am comfortable to apply it around my eyes everyday.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product on my under eye area for a few days now and I really like the way it makes my face feel. I will update once I have had more time to test more.</li>
            <li> It smells good and works great!!</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product. I love that it&#x27;s in liquid drop form so I don&#x27;t have to dip my entire finger into product. I love how soft my skin feels afterwords.</li>
            <li> Great product and does wonders for my bags under my eyes. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working.  I love the texture and that it is fast absorbing</li>
            <li> Fantastic serum! All organic, raw, gluten free and vegan. It can&#x27;t get better than that :) My wrinkles around the eyes are gone :)</li>
            <li> Wow, this is beautifully packaged and &amp;#34;eye&amp;#34; anticipate loving it!  Will try to give an update review sometime soon when I have more opportunity to use it.</li>
            <li> Exactly product my fine lines around my eyes have gone or have been soften....love it</li>
            <li> Very nice.will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great product! Though I don&#x27;t see any drastic changes in the skin under my eyes, this product does not irritate my skin or cause dryness. I love the smell! I can really smell the rose geranium - which is a light and soothingly feminine smell without being overpowering.  I would say it&#x27;s comparable...better even... than much more costly products.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks and I am seeing a difference with my skin.. I will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to give a professional opinion.</li>
            <li> goes on nicely, drys quickly and isn&#x27;t oily once it sets. Great product! I&#x27;m slowly but surly seeing a difference under my eyes!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I am 61 and I have been using for a couple of weeks and can tell a difference in my skin already. I use it in the morning and before bedtime. I have very dry skin and flake really bad. I no longer have this flaking going on. My skin around my eyes is softer, less fine lines and wrinkles. It leaves your skin feeling moisturized and has a very light nice scent. You can also use this product around your lips. It only takes a little of this product to go a long way.</li>
            <li> This stuff works! I work nights and often have bags and dark circles on my eyes. This alleviates this issue. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great for giving extra moisture around eyes</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I would say within a couple of weeks I noticed results.  The crows feet (laugh lines I like to call them) have softened , my skin is soft and smooth. I have tried many products over the years and  I am totally hooked on this serum.  A little really does go along way so this should last for months.</li>
            <li> My skin feels more supple and soft, less puffiness too.</li>
            <li> This is great for your eyes. I have only been using for a little while but I have seen results. I love the feel of this. I would recommend to my friends...</li>
            <li> Works well.  Helps to reduce some of the eye puffiness I&#x27;ve had due to allergies.</li>
            <li> The perfect product for puffy eyes and crows feet too!</li>
            <li> I love this little jar of happiness! You only need a drop. The eye serum feels luxurious and great quality. I have been using it for a few weeks now and love how it feels on my skin (under my eyes and above lips). I recommend you try it!</li>
            <li> No bueno it burns my eyes  every time I apply  it and it doesn&#x27;t  work</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.... Love this product!  I am a repeat customer😊👍</li>
            <li> Love this serum! It helps my under eye bags so much and doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is the best eye serum on the market. My eyes love it and never get swollen as with  many other eye cremes. It softens wrinkles feels lovely on and smells fabulous. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with this wonderful eye serum. After only a weeks use, the fine lines around my eyes and lips (yes, and lips) are less defined and smoother, and I feel hydrated even after a long day. The subtle fragrance is delightful as well. Looking forward to trying all of the Immortelle line of skin care products. Sure beats all those products with the nasty chemicals!!</li>
            <li> Tried for a few days, but felt a bit oily.  I will try it again and leave another review.  I will say my eyes looks more refreshed the next morning after using it, but I just felt that it was oily.</li>
            <li> I love the high quality organic ingredients. The bottle may look tiny but you only use a drop or two at a time so it should last. I wish there was a different top on it - since I knocked it over and lost half of it.</li>
            <li> I like the way it minimizes my smile lines and moisturizes around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Used this last night and woke up with great looking eyes. My eyes are always puffy and I have dark circles. I love this new product I tried. Will buy again</li>
            <li> I love this eye serum.  It softens the skin around my eyes and does a good job at smoothing my fine lines.</li>
            <li> This serum is natural and I love that aspect, it is a serum but like an oil so you only need 1-2 drops. I saw a huge difference in less puffiness and my eyes brighter and fine lines softened. Highly recommended!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! I just started using it about one month ago. It feels so good on my skin. My skin is SO DRY and I actually feel like this, plus the other face serum, makes a big difference in me having soft skin that looks and feels more healthy! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the size of this bottle fool you, only a drop or two is needed for both eyes. It has a light calming scent and is very soothing to use. It is most helpful for my morning puffy eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple weeks and so far I&#x27;ve seen definite change around my eyes.  The lines/wrinkles are fading and smoothing out.  One drawback is that the serum doesn&#x27;t seem to totally absorb into the skin therefore it gets a little greasy around the eyes.  Other than that it&#x27;s been a great product.</li>
            <li> Visible difference in just a few days!</li>
            <li> I am using this take care of the problem spot in the middle of my forehead where my CPAP cushion rests.  It has cured the chapped area completely.  It absorbs right in and leaves no oily or greasy feeling at all.</li>
            <li> Great product!  The puffiness and slight lines around my eyes go away after applying this product.  Great find!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using the eye serum for about a week now. I am pleased with the results. Morning puffiness and fine lines are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I can see the difference in my eyes already. Like the dropper, easy to use. Not greasy. This is a high quality product at a great price</li>
            <li> love this product.. I&#x27;m always hesitant to put products on my face and near my eyes!.. But I gave this a try last week and I immediately felt softer skin. Will update if I notice a visual difference.</li>
            <li> So wonderful. ! Takes away bags !! Smooths wrinkles.  Brightens my eyes !!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my mother.  she is extremely well satisfied with it.  She states it is easy to apply and non&#x3D;greasy.</li>
            <li> I love this.  I feel younger already!</li>
            <li> Wonderful serum. It smells lovely, doesn&#x27;t irritate my (extremely) sensitive skin, &amp; leaves my skin feeling soft. I use it around my eyes and also on my lips!</li>
            <li> This eye serum really works.  Im not a fan of the scent but i&#x27;t s  ok because the product really works.  I typically use it only at night because it&#x27;s a little greasy for the day but I have to tell you that it really really hydrates and that is what I typically look for because my skin is really dry.  I would highly recommend this product if you are looking to get results.</li>
            <li> I love this eye serum because it is made from certified natural organic ingredients, it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes, it feels nice when I apply it and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Very moisture and like the smell, not too strong</li>
            <li> Very soothing. I have used it for about a week and can see a difference in my skin already my fine lines haven&#x27;t dissappeared yet but I can see how much my under eye area is moisturizedoing</li>
            <li> I got this product a week ago I really like it but I think I like it more around my lips that around my eyes, I can really see the differece  in the fine lines around my lips getting smoother , I will keep trying it around my eyes and see what happen!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing..  So far so good!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been using long but I really like it so far. Plus it helps my concealer stay on and looking fresh all day!</li>
            <li> Works well and no stinging or burning like I get from other eye creams.</li>
            <li> This product has made such a difference that me husband has noticed.</li>
            <li> excellent product for the eye, but u have to apply to the outer orbit since it run into the eyes</li>
            <li> This serum is in an attractive bottle, has a very light floral scent, absorbs really fast, and feels great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the whole anti aging scene so I confess to not knowing much about it. What I do know is that I started using this eye serum a month and a half ago and the bags under my eyes are looking much better. A little secret, I sometimes use this on my hands. It makes them so soft.</li>
            <li> The first times I used this I was amazed...I really thought I noticed an immediate difference....was I imagining it? So I waited and tried again tonight. This time I can&#x27;t say I saw an immediate, definite difference like I could swear I did the first time, but it still felt really nourishing. I bet if I could actually remember to use this every morning and night it would really help. I think I was so amazed at the first time that I totally overlooked the smell. I noticed tonight the various floral scents- reminded me of an old lady.</li>
            <li> I gave this product a 4 star rating only because I have not noticed a change in the dark circles.  In fairness, I have used it about 10 days and it may take longer to achieve those results.  I have noticed the dry skin around the bottom of my eyes is much better.  I would recommend it and will update my comment after using a few weeks.  I did receive this at a reduced rate to try and give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> This product has been great in hydrating the fine lines around my eyes.  I definitely see a reduction in the depth of the lines around my eyes.  A little goes a long ways with this serum, so you don&#x27;t need to use a lot.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I did not receive this product at a discount for my review, I purchased it at FULL price and this is my honest opinion. I will do my best to describe this product to help you decide if it&#x27;s right for you. the product arrived on time and comes in a beautiful glass, recycled bottle with a dropper for application.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read many of the reviews so far and some say the product is too oily and didn&#x27;t absorb well. Its a serum made up of organic essential oils and they are known for their ability to &amp;#34;penetrate the skin&amp;#34; better than lotions, gels or creams. I think the problem is people are applying too much, I know I did at first and had trouble getting it to fully absorb.&lt;br /&gt;The serum feels creamy, and for my first application I used one drop under each eye. I was expecting something a little lighter in texture, and it didn&#x27;t absorb as fast as I thought it would, but it did COMPLETELY absorb into my skin. It says it&#x27;s good for all skin types.&lt;br /&gt;The second time I used only one drop to treat both under eye areas, and then one drop for my upper and lower lip area. It absorbed quickly this time, no problem. My friend has very dry skin and she uses two to three drops and she says it absorbs pretty quickly. She told me about this serum and uses it morning and night, under her makeup, and loves it. I think how much you use and how often depends on your skin type. For me with oily skin, one drop is enough and two drops is too much. I suggest you use less at first, start with only one drop for both eyes and see how quickly it absorbs into your skin. Then try using two drops and compare the results.&lt;br /&gt;The smell isn&#x27;t strong and doesn&#x27;t linger, but it definitely has the scent of essential oils which I love. Most eye products sting and irritate my eyes, and seem to stay on the surface of my skin. This one does not irritate my eyes or skin and it fully absorbs.&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are wonderful and I love that it has pumpkin seed oil and helichrysum, very rare tofind this blend. I&#x27;ve read that helichrysum essential oil is highly effective at reducing dark spots, age spots, sun spots...whatever you want to call them. I have a lot of them and this serum is working really well to lighten and reduce them - a huge bonus I wasn&#x27;t expecting! I saw improvement in puffiness and swelling too, and the fine lines around my eyes are less apparent, after about two weeks of use. I don&#x27;t have dark circles under my eyes so i can&#x27;t comment on that, but my thinking is if it&#x27;s working to reduce dark spots on the side of my face and neck, why wouldn&#x27;t it work to reduce dark under eye circles?</li>
            <li> Took the advice of many reviewers who said that it stayed on top of the skin and was very oily and started out by just putting one drop under each eye, and found that that was not enough for me. While I have very oily skin all over my face for some reason the area directly under my eyes seems a bit drier and benefited from two drops in this area. It took about a minute to a minute and a half for the serum to be fully absorbed to the point where it did not feel oily at all to the touch. What makes this serum unique is that it has pumpkin seed oil and helichrysum, very rare to find in an eye serum and something that I would expect to jack the price up a bit more than it is here. They are loaded with vitamin a, c and zinc, omega 3,6, fatty acids and antioxidants and unlike most serums have the unique ability to penetrate the dermis  to increase cell regeneration and production of collagen and elastin. Helichrysum is the ingredient responsible for the reduction of hyperpigmentation and therefore removing the dark brown spots,  on your skin. That was the first result I saw after beginning use of the serum, a reduction in the dark spots, caused by years of sun damage, around my eyes. So before even waiting to see further results I began using it on the rest of my face as well, despite the fact that I already have oily skin. I used it in very small amounts, mixed with my sunscreen in the morning and with my moisturizer at night, and it did not cause me to have any breakouts. Within two weeks I saw the dark spots on the rest of my face begin to fade as well, while it continued to work on the skin around my eyes on the loose skin and crepe like wrinkles.  After about three weeks I noticed a firming up of the I skin and an overall brightness to the eye area.  I am extremely happy with the results I have seen thus far and I will report back in about a month after I&#x27;ve seen the results up until that point. But I&#x27;m sure that the results will continue to get better and better.</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t absorb nicely into the skin...even the smallest amount leaves my skin feeling oily all day. I haven&#x27;t noticed any reduction of fine lines but it&#x27;s only been a week so maybe over time...given the rave reviews, I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for a couple of weeks now and I can&#x27;t tell yet if any improvement but there may be some small reduction of darkness under the eyes. I&#x27;ll keep at it and hopefully the improvement will become more visible.</li>
            <li> It takes time to see the improvement, but after a while skin becomes fire and bad marks are disappearing...Patience...GREAT SERUM</li>
            <li> Great product. The dropper could be a smaller size where the oil comes out for you only need such a tiny amount ant it seems to come out rather fast.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for! I wanted something to hydrate the skin below my eyes because sometimes they were dry in the morning which made my make up cake and enhanced any wrinkles. Now I&#x27;ve noticed I don&#x27;t have that problem because I use this serum before bed. Because it&#x27;s not oily, it&#x27;s also good for use before I apply my make up. I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled to have found this.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, absorbs well, wrinkles are somewhat softer. You just need a drop for both eyes, so this will last a long time!!</li>
            <li> This is a really nice eye serum, it&#x27;s nourishing and helps with the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. I love the smell of this and the quality is really great!</li>
            <li> Luxurious, effective serum. I love the high quality ingredients and how easily the product goes on. The bottle may look tiny but you only use a drop or two at a time so it will last quite awhile. I&#x27;m really happy I received this to review for my blog and would definitely consider ordering again in the future.</li>
            <li> So far, I really like this eye serum, a lot!!  I will update my review when I have finished the bottle.  But so far I&#x27;m impressed.  Has a very silky, oil texture and soaks in nicely.  Excited to continue my usage and see the promised results</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous and effective.  It is important to me that a product absorbs and does not just sit on my skin or dissipates without giving me the moisture and desired result.  I live on the beach and enjoy being outside in the sunshine.  I protect my skin and this serum helps me nourish and refresh my skin. Everyone thinks I am much younger than I am. How very nice is that</li>
            <li> I have a skin care routine that I have followed religiously for the past 20 years using a well-known non-retail store brand.  My skin is in really good condition however I have dry skin around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product feels great going on and absorbs into my skin really well.  As a result, my concealer and eye shadow no longer creases and stays on all day.  I have only been using it for a week, so as far as the fine lines, I can&#x27;t say it works yet, but I am very pleased with the moisture it is providing around and on my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely purchase again.  It might be that in a couple of months, I will notice the other benefits that the product states.  Many other reviews have stated that it works, so I&#x27;m looking forward to continued results.</li>
            <li> This has helped with small wrinkles and darkness but trust me on this--use a very small amount! I can only use it at night because it takes too long to absorb. One more warning, hold the dropper over the bottle because you don&#x27;t have to squeeze for a drop to come out! I lost a couple of drops into the sink. There is no odor (a good thing) and I am enjoying the results. If I am off for a day and don&#x27;t need makeup, I put it on in the morning as well.</li>
            <li> Have only used it twice but my eyes look less wrinkled. Good moisture</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd bottle purchased.  I am very please with the results: non greasy, dries flat-no shine remains, works well with my concealer, very pleasant, mild botanic fragrance . I am 63 years old and have used so many, many expensive eye moisturizers-serums in my lifetime. My advice: save some money and invest in this nourishing serum. Hope the company comes out with a whole face/neck moisturizer!</li>
            <li> THIS ORGANIC FORMULA IS GENIUS!  SMELLS AND FEELS SO NATURAL.  I HAVE BEEN ALLERGIC TO ALL EYE CREAMS I EVER TRIED.  THIS IS THE FIRST PRODUCT I CAN USE, IT WORKS AND  MY EYES ARE LOOKING GREAT.  THE FINE LINES AND SUN SPOTS ARE DIMINISHING.  I CAN&#x27;T WAIT TO TRY OTHER PRODUCTS FROM THIS MANUFACTURER!  i AM OVER 50 AND LOVING IT!  A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY!</li>
            <li> Just started using this product and it is amazing-my dark circles have almost disappeared and my concealer goes on so smoothly.  Great eye serum!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it personally and love how concentrated it is! A few drops will cover your eyes &amp; entire face! It goes on smoothly, smells great, and feels great on your skin too. Immortelle&#x27; Organics is an exceedingly high quality brand that has beautifully formulated products like their skin toner that works well with this serum too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should know! I&#x27;m an eye doctor with a cosmetic laser practice in Chicago, and only use organic products for post-laser skin care around the eyes and face. Am so pleased with how safe and gentle it is. Am definitely sold on the organic eye serum, and will continue using it, and telling friends, family &amp; patients about it too! It&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
            <li> Immortellé Organics Nourishing Eye Serum is Exactly as it states.  Nourishing Organics and Botanicals in a silky smooth oil, with a light, pleasant botanical fragrance.  I like to use products for a couple weeks at least, before I review and this delicate, effective oil has exceeded all my expectations.  All I need is One drop on the tip of my ring finger for both eyes.  That is more than enough.  I lightly dab under my eyes and up past the outside corner.  It is rich and silky smooth.  I apply it after my toner so it can fully absorb before applying makeup; and after cleansing at night before bed.  My under eye skin is very sensitive and this has worked wonderfully for me.  In only a couple of weeks that area is becoming softer and more supple.  Even though it doesn&#x27;t say, I also use one drop on and around the delicate lip area.  Those little fine lines are also improving.  And, I don&#x27;t waste any; I continue to rub any little bit of this wonderfully nourishing serum into my hands.</li>
            <li> This product has some amazing ingredients in it.  Plus it feels amazing.  I will only use products on my face that are free of harmful chemicals, and this serum fits the bill.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this Immortelle Eye Serum!  I have been using it around my eyes and also around my mouth.  It goes on so smoothly and absorbs very quickly.  I feel like I am giving myself a treat every time I use it!  My skin feels more plumped up - like it is rehydrated.  I am really happy with this!</li>
            <li> Great product, item as described, very useful.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I could tell as soon as i put it on my face.</li>
            <li> Just got this in and immediately applied to my eyes. Nice feel and the serum diminished puffiness, lightened the skin around my eyes and that was in minutes. This will definitely be a part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li> This eye serum is easy to use and I notice results right away.  I had a stubborn &amp;#34;pregnancy mask&amp;#34; from my son that is now almost 3.  It got worse when I was pregnant with my second son and I was so frustrated by it.  I started using this serum and notice a difference right away.  It&#x27;s still there but it&#x27;s not nearly as noticeable.</li>
            <li> Love the ingredients and packaging. I&#x27;m just not convinced that thick oils are the best for putting around my eyes. I have tried it a few times and have felt that it left my area under my eye feeling sticky with thick oil. I will keep trying to see if there is a way to use it that will work better for me. I have sensitive skin and maybe just need to use a very small drop spread only under my eye and not on the eyelid.</li>
            <li> It does feel lovely when applied.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still using the product..... Will update when I&#x27;m 10yrs younger</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It makes the area around my eyes feel softer.  I have noticed less dark circles under my eyes as well.  Overall, my eyes have less lines and look younger! I would recommend this product to anyone looking to improve the area around their eyes!</li>
            <li> This really make my face glow and can&#x27;t wait to see final results.</li>
            <li> Have only been using it for a week, but am liking it so far.</li>
            <li> Smell great and feels awesome, I think I need more time to evaluate the product more thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Obvious results after only one application</li>
            <li> This is a great product! It just takes a little bit and goes on smoothly with pleasant scent. I have used for a week, now, and love the results!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best eye serum that I have come across.This works great around my eyes and helps with wrinkles (which I needed help there).It is 100% organic,which is great. I never used to pay any attention about the ingredients in some of my products such as this one. Lately though, I have been concerned about some of the chemicals in products.I try to get the products that doesn&#x27;t have many chemicals in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oils in this product gives it a pleasant aroma.It is not a overwhelming smell.The oils in this serum comes together and helps nourish your skin and makes it feel smoother.I was so happy to receive this product for my unbiased opinion.When you look at the bottle ,you think that is a small bottle. Keep in mind though it only takes a little bit so it goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe you will be amazed of the difference you will feel and see once you have used this serum for a little while.</li>
            <li> This Oil is AMAZING!! I put it on at night around my eyes and on my eyebrows. After one week, I could tell a difference in my fine lines and puffiness. In 2 weeks, my eyebrows are filling in(I think the castor oil is helping this) and even better results! I will buy this again and again! I know it&#x27;s not the least expensive out there, but it is worth every penny to me!</li>
            <li> VERY NOURISHING FOR THE EYE. DON&#x27;T REALLY LIKE THE SMELL BUT THAT&#x27;S OKAY. MAKE SURE YOU DON&#x27;T PUT IT TOO CLOSE TO THE EYE BECAUSE IT WILL GO INTO YOUR EYES AND IT GETS ALL BLURRY.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Noticed improvement around my eyes within a few days.</li>
            <li> I love that this product is all natural. I actually look forward to using it in my daily skin care regimen both morning and night. Even after just a couple of days of use, I could notice a difference in the appearance of fine lines around my eyes. I feel like my skin looks smoother and more youthful. I am excited to continue to regularly use this product and see its effects on my skin!</li>
            <li> I use this before bed, it&#x27;s a heavier oil so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it under makeup.  When I wake my under eyes are lesser creepy, and I swear the bags are diminishing</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! It&#x27;s seriously a miracle in a little bottle!!! I use it for my eyes and lips. You only need a drop - and blended with concealer for under my eyes it goes on smooth, no creases, and leaves a little glow that keeps me smiling. Great product! Everyone needs a bottle!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eye serum for about 3 days so far, and I&#x27;m really enjoying it!  It&#x27;s very emollient, and feels wonderful under the eyes and over the orbital bone. I believe with continued use, I will see great results!  It smells divine, and most of all, I love that it&#x27;s completely organic and non toxic. I highly recommend this wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Have only used it for a few days, so hard top give a full review, but it&#x27;s gentle and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> &#x27;I am happy with this product&lt;br /&gt; I have noticed that the dark spots around my eyes have diminished and my face has more of a glow and moisture.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly. Taking but too soon to tell if it&#x27;s working yet.</li>
            <li> I really love this. It leaves my eye area so incredibly soft!</li>
            <li> Can already see some results after just a week of use.</li>
            <li> Just started using the product and already loving it.</li>
            <li> I so need this. I am getting hardly any sleep! This smells great, and feels good in....</li>
            <li> Really excite, just use it last night &amp; it felt wonderful.</li>
    </ol>
