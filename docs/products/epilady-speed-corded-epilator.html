    <ol>
            <li>This items works wonderful on my legs, underarms, bikini line, and even my fingers and toes!</li>
            <li>I was very impressed!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful not having five o&#x27;clock shadow on my legs and underarms!</li>
            <li>This Epilady works just perfect!</li>
            <li>However, I gather up the courage and had the best hair removal session ever.</li>
            <li>Works great once you get the hang of it!</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t perfect.  </li>

            <li>Not that great of a product.</li>
            <li>I am really glad to return to the Epilady and especially glad I found this model!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used it to good effect on my underarms, and it worked great on my arms, which I hadn&#x27;t ever shaved.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m thrilled!  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for a really good hair removal item</li>
            <li>Medicating in advance will be good too.  </li>
            <li>this is a really good</li>
            <li>Does a good job on legs and underarms.  </li>
            <li>I believe this is as good as it gets.</li>
            <li>Good value for the price</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive this item in the mail since I have owned an epilady years ago and it worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I surprisingly love this!  </li>
            <li>I am pretty impressed.</li>
            <li>Hurt like hell the first couple of times, but has been wonderful and mostly painless since!  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li>I am even able to shave my bikini line with it!</li>
            <li>BUT, if you then get the hand-me-down Epilady...you will love it!</li>
            <li>But as for now, this is a Great purchase at a great price for a 1st timer; and if you dont have as much hair</li>
            <li>Good luck :)</li>
            <li>Still, this really is the best bang for your buck, so</li>
            <li>No, it is NOT painless, though it does allow you to go at your own pace.  </li>
            <li>Just keep a pair of tweezers handy for any renegades.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>Yes, I am a man with very hairy arms and chest and does a perfect job!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never waxed or done any kind of epilating before</li>
            <li>It also came with a Perfect Angle Guide (nice surprise) to allow a new user practice the correct angle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to handle and manipulate.</li>
            <li>So far its an awesome product.</li>
            <li>It works great under the arms and around the knees exactly where I need it to.  </li>
            <li>Works better sometimes than others.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs, but gets most of them.  </li>
            <li>I will buy one more as a backup, just in case.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to shave my thighs, since its once a month anyway :)</li>
            <li>Especially great for sunny vacations - no red bumps!</li>
            <li>and so glad after checking every item and reading lots of reviews I purchased this Epilady.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many epilators over the lat 15 years, they always break at some point.  </li>
            <li>mostly have relied on shaving with a triple blade razor, and have had my legs waxed maybe 10 times over the years too.  </li>
            <li>ok but is now loosing power.</li>
            <li>ok I guess.</li>
            <li>I started this time with this inexpensive model because I wasn&#x27;t sure I would be able to become re-accustomed to the pain.  </li>
            <li>From my experience and based on my observation it takes preparedness and practice to be worthwhile and to learn in order to not end up with ingrown hairs or upset skin.  </li>
            <li>With that said, I believe this epilator is currently better than the others we&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying the better version of this in hopes it will remove underarm hair more efficiently.</li>
            <li>It did, however, promote considerably more hair growth.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s cheap and not as nice a product as I have had from Epilady</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels as it removes the hair</li>
            <li>It is much more time effcient &amp;</li>
            <li>Love it and buy it</li>
            <li>Also, 40 tweezers gets more hair per stroke than the 20 tweezer varieties.</li>
            <li>Many people have attested that corded devices have both a longer life and stronger power than cordless varieties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>once a week is all i  need love it&#x27;</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t write a lot of reviews, but there were so many conflicting reviews on these</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a good quality product at a reasonable price, and an excellent choice for hair removal.  </li>
            <li>Never was happy with the replacement brand but paid too much money (all the bells and whistles - light, rechargeable, etc) to throw it out.</li>
            <li>What it didn&#x27;t get last week, it gets this week, and best of all, even though not all the hair comes out, my legs stay smooth from week to week.</li>
            <li>The tweezer head rotates in a way that the gaps change width, so it&#x27;s very easy to clean when you are done.  </li>
            <li>So far, this product is working great.</li>
            <li>So far, this one&#x27;s working great.</li>
            <li>This epilator is pretty loud, not the best for discreet usage.</li>
            <li>It was so comfortable I ended up taking off more than I planned...</li>
            <li>Good quality product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>ever since my good old Brown epilator died (after many long years, to be fair) I&#x27;ve been looking for a good replacement.</li>
            <li>easy was the experience of using it on my underarms.  </li>
            <li>It works just as good as it says and doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as my older one.</li>
            <li>if you are looking at trying epilating out for the first time, this is a great product to try out since you won&#x27;t be losing too much if you can&#x27;t handle the method.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight and easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>This one has a neat little head that helps you adjust the angle to get the best results.</li>
            <li>I love my epilady (can even use on bikini area if you&#x27;re careful and brave)</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s cheaper than waxing and my legs stay smooth for days.</li>
            <li>Easy to handle and clean.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Great product have used it for years this is my 2nd one.</li>
            <li>It is what you can expect from a cheap epilator.</li>
            <li>if I wanted smooth legs to go out at night.</li>
            <li>It even comes with two caps, one with a guide on it to help you hold it in the correct position until you get comfortable with using it.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re shaving an area where the skin isn&#x27;t taut, use your free hand to pull the skin smooth</li>
            <li>So far so good-</li>
            <li>I read on someone else&#x27;s review to use Dove deodorant  after using the Epilady to prevent in-grown hairs and so far so good.</li>
            <li>I have used another epilator (by Bliss/Philips) and this one is far superior.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with my new Epilator.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re smooth and clean after using.  </li>
            <li>no man comes all smooth and clean shaven.  </li>
            <li>Not as nice as the older model Epilady but does the job.</li>
            <li>This new (to me) model is awesome and totally deserves the 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s super easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li>This epilator has more tweezers than some brands and they seems pretty</li>
            <li>and it has not disappointed me yet on any of these</li>
            <li>I was excited to use it, but didn&#x27;t know what was the correct way to use it, when I figured it out</li>
            <li>I had one of the original Epilady&#x27;s with the spinning, rotating wire loops.  </li>
            <li>Lay out a towel as hair does not collect anywhere and the clean up will be aggravating.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it 3 times since receiving it, but I am very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>Wow do I love this product!  </li>
            <li>Each one broke right after the warranty expired (of course!).  </li>
            <li>Older models I have owned were much better than what is currently available.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve read such wonderful reviews on epilating in general that I thought I would give this a try.</li>
            <li>I decided for the price to give an electric tweezer one more try, to see if I could manage something at home where I stay smooth for more than 36 hours, and maybe get rid of some of those double hairs.  </li>
            <li>as I do then youll probably love it also &amp; have a much better lasting experience with this product.</li>
            <li>My hair grows quickly, too.&lt;br /&gt;Pain</li>
            <li>I just went over it quickly in a circular pattern, and my skin felt numbed.  </li>
            <li>This one is corded, and has ample power to do the job quickly.</li>
            <li>Quick touch up does it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy enough to keep clean (very important for the armpit area).  </li>
            <li>Works great on the upper lip also, but be sure to use it on the low setting.</li>
            <li>It lasts quite a while, and it allows easy maintenance without making appointments or setting aside large blocks of your time.</li>
            <li>I had to buy a new one and wasn&#x27;t quite sure whether to buy this one or not, and let me say thank God</li>
            <li>For my legs, however, I am IN LOVE with this new option, and would pick it over shaving any day, given the results and longevity.er, I am IN LOVE with this new option, and would pick it over shaving any day, given the results and longevity.</li>
            <li>No red bumps, no five o&#x27;clock shadows!&lt;br /&gt;NO MORE SHAVING!</li>
            <li>3 years old, decided I needed a new one because the Remington just wasn&#x27;t working that good anymore.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this a few times &amp; it works great.  </li>
            <li>WAY better than the old style.  </li>
            <li>however, pain was worth it for me.</li>
            <li>Totally worth</li>
            <li>It helped an old pro like me. :-)</li>
            <li>All in all, it&#x27;s worth a try to see if it works for you.</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s worth it...</li>
            <li>I will say that I believe I made the right purchase; it didn&#x27;t break the bank, and works quite well.  </li>
            <li>I followed the instructions to hold the skin taut and use the right angle shown in the picture, it still did not pick up the hair.</li>
            <li>These are so underrated as an easy, relatively pain free, and inexpensive hair removal tool.  </li>
            <li>able to use this on my legs, underarms and bikini area (if using this in a sensitive area, remember to use the guard and hold skin taut!), but I have no need to use it on my face or arms, so I can&#x27;t really say how well it works on those areas of the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>I own another epilator, a larger, dual-head model, for removing hair from arms and legs, because it is fast and removes hair from a large patch with each stroke.  </li>
            <li>Using this Epilday on the high speed in constant oval motion, I was able to complete both lower legs &amp; knees in under 15 minutes with nothing more than discomfort.  </li>
            <li>Not lying, first use for underarms</li>
            <li>is reduced after first use.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;After first use, time taken is reduced, too.</li>
            <li>When I first turned on, it scared me out of my skin.</li>
            <li>It hurt so much!  </li>
            <li>I will probably do my underarms one or two more times, to help remove all the double/triple hairs, but not on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li>I have been using an epilator since they were first sold in the U.S. in the 80s, I think.  </li>
            <li>there&#x27;s still more left to do.  </li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this Epilady to a friend!</li>
            <li>First time out 27 some years ago)</li>
            <li>results are better when you shave with a regular razor.  </li>
            <li>I switched to another epilator after my first Epilady died.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving my legs for more than 40 years and I&#x27;m part Roma, so I had to shave daily, twice a day</li>
            <li>If it got all of the hair without me having to go over my legs so many times, then I would have given it 5 stars, but I won&#x27;t go back to shaving.</li>
            <li>It does take time to do large areas, but you CAN use this on your private areas relatively safely.  </li>
            <li>My original Epilady was about 15 years old when it needed replacement.  </li>
            <li>I went to plug in my old, trusty Epilady, using what I thought was a safe adaptor, and it got completely fried.  </li>
            <li>I think this one, the Epilady EP-810-44 must be the updated version of my old Epilady, and it works so much better and is so much quieter than the old one!</li>
            <li>Works so much better than shaving and lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li>Sometimes will not remove very fine short hair but in general does all right.</li>
            <li>Got this one because it is small and will fit better in luggage.  </li>
            <li>This one seems less effective.  </li>
            <li>It hurts less than waxing, though, and if you do your own waxing, you will appreciate how you don&#x27;t have to DREAD ripping the sheet off and cleaning up all the tacky</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a first time user, buy the cheapest model you feel comfortable with and try it out before committing to a larger investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It took off the thick hairs on my legs and arms pretty good</li>
            <li>This is my second epilady - my first one is probably 5 years (or older) and still going strong.  </li>
            <li>good while worked but did not last very long</li>
            <li>girlfriend loved it.&lt;br /&gt;Not to use everyday, no skin irritation, yes some pain, but skin remain soft for days!</li>
            <li>I used this particular epilator for the first time a couple of weeks ago, and it was as if I had never stopped using one.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I much prefer not having a battery that will eventually cease holding a charge.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work as well as waxing because this just doesn&#x27;t pull the hair out as fast.</li>
            <li>I really like it though and will probably get an upgrade to replace.</li>
            <li>Not like the very 1st coiled wire one.</li>
            <li>Yes, let&#x27;s be real---</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this epilator!</li>
            <li>Really, that was how I started.  </li>
            <li>TWO:  Real improvement.  </li>
            <li>The frequency to need its service negates the need to have it charged and ready at any time.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really pluck much hair off .</li>
            <li>It kind of felt like the buzziness of a TENS pad, if you have ever used those in physical therapy, totally tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have determined that single-headed epilators get the job done just as well since the dual headed ones prove to be unreliable, and when the dual headed ones break, their single head doesn&#x27;t do as good a job as one that was designed to have a single head.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased, little to no mess comparatively to waxing.</li>
            <li>Moreover, the brush makes it much easier to remove the hairs that may get inside and treats it gently so that you can be sure you won&#x27;t mess with anything.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more picky about angle than my braun and takes a little more effort to get almost every hair, but it also costs half as much.  </li>
            <li>Hurts just as much, but I can live with it to get the hair gone for an extended amount of time.</li>
            <li>It does pinch, slightly, but its not \\&quot;painful\\&quot; as many people suggest w/ epilators.</li>
            <li>The EP-810-44 is even more efficient and faster to use than my previous corded Epilady.  </li>
            <li>Works a lot faster than the older spiral models did.  </li>
            <li>It was ok last only 9 months but while it did work it was</li>
            <li>I first started using an epilator in my first year of law school at the age of 23, and I continued doing so for about ten years.  </li>
            <li>The instructions are a bit lacking so below is a step by step that I&#x27;ve done that is working w/ this particular model.  </li>
            <li>Knees and where the thigh meets the pelvis are the most difficult and will take many passes so be patient.  </li>
            <li>braun has discontinued all their high end corded models.  </li>
            <li>Pull skin taught and begin on the HIGH speed in an oval motion from the ankle up, I imagined \\&quot;wax on, wax off\\&quot; from Karate Kid.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if my expectations are just way too high</li>
            <li>After the two with dual heads broke, I was able to continue using them for a little while with just one head (one I&#x27;m still using on my legs).  </li>
            <li>So far the quality seems okay, and it certainly does the job, but I don&#x27;t know how long it will last.  </li>
            <li>So far the quality seems okay, and it certainly does the job, but I don&#x27;t know how long it will last.  </li>
            <li>It would seem I&#x27;m either not flexible enough to stretch my skin in the right direction, user error, or</li>
            <li>One of the head guards it comes with makes it easy to get the angle right at least.  </li>
            <li>I only use it on my lower leg since upper leg hair is fine and it doesn&#x27;t seem to quite get it all.</li>
            <li>so I had to purchase a new epilator.  </li>
            <li>I put off buying a new one because of the unfavorable exchange rate, and then by the time I returned to the U.S.</li>
            <li>I literally can&#x27;t live without this.</li>
            <li>Then about two months ago I actually sat down and calculated how much I was spending on overpriced razor catridges, and I decided that an Epilady was a much better investment.  </li>
            <li>I bought this little guy months ago, and loved it starting about the second time I used it.</li>
            <li>If you wax, the pain is pretty similar (you get used to it!)</li>
            <li>I remember the original epilady and the rotating coils, and my total confusion as to how anyone could tolerate doing that to themselves on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I can only wonder if a more expensive model would be more thorough?  </li>
            <li>With the epilady, it&#x27;s more subtle and you can go much longer between shaves.</li>
            <li>The first time we tried this we realized that we had to make several sweeps of the hair to completely remove the hair.  </li>
            <li>a  little tingle andmylegs  and face stay smooth for  days  hopefully  as i have had this for a month  </li>
            <li>The only reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is they could have made the head a little wider to get more hairs at once.  </li>
            <li>A swipe of Tendskin, though, and some ibuprofen helped clear it up in a couple of hours.  </li>
            <li>So get your zen on and clear your mind during use.  </li>
            <li>I was shopping for a replacement, and was surprised at how much epilators have gone up in price since purchasing my last one!</li>
            <li>This is the clear winner.</li>
            <li>That being said, I use this sucker by Epilady on my armpits and it does a fantastic job!  </li>
            <li>so i don&#x27;t look so old</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re trying this for the first time don&#x27;t wait until the hair gets too long.  </li>
            <li>If the hair is 1/4 inch it will bring tears to his eyes, so it really needs to be short to be tolerable.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s loud</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my old Epilady that stopped working after about 9 years of use.</li>
            <li>and I replaced my old epilady</li>
            <li>Bought for my 95 year old mother.</li>
            <li>Pulling the skin taut also reduces the pain considerably.</li>
            <li>i  surprised i dont feel anything</li>
            <li>I am so much happier with the physical appearance of my skin.  </li>
            <li>My wife has used one for many years, and our granddaughter has been borrowing hers,for the last few months,so we got her one for Christmas.</li>
            <li>TESTED AND LOVE IT - for all those with THICK hair - this is the product for you.</li>
            <li>Pain isn&#x27;t worth it and thin hair is harder for the Epilady to grasp and effectively remove.</li>
            <li>But you need to do your homework in order to avoid this, which means: exfoliate, moisturize, take a hot shower and dry off before epilating, and remember to pull the skin taut on EVERY area you go over-</li>
            <li>It clearly doesn&#x27;t run as fast and maybe it doesn&#x27;t need to, but as a result is sounds a little funny.  </li>
            <li>Overall, much less expensive than buying replacement razor cartridges, and much, much more effective.</li>
            <li>I tried to do my lip but this item is a bit too large and awkward for that...and much too large to precisely do the eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Even though this new one is similar to the design of the last non-Epilady model, I am so much happier with it.</li>
            <li>TAUGHT is key here and keep speed at HIGH.  </li>
            <li>the only drawback I can think of is the cord isn&#x27;t very long, so getting a rechargeable one might be worth considering.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just purchased this item and have never used an epilator before; needless to say that I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It isn&#x27;t very efficient and takes a long time to do a thorough job&lt;</li>
            <li>Normally after I shave my legs by the second day</li>
            <li>I was very red and irritated in my underarms after, as compared to leg skin remaining smooth and pale.  </li>
            <li>This is ok if you want something less expensive and to do light hair removal jobs.</li>
            <li>after a few passes on HIGH, set speed to LOW and make a few more passes.  </li>
            <li>Change the angle frequently or move the device in a circular pattern, since hair often grows in different directions.  </li>
            <li>Both work very well, but the larger, dual-head model does not work well on the smaller areas such as knees, underarms, etc.</li>
            <li>I have spent so much time using this on my legs and still have stubble.</li>
            <li>but I only needed to use it twice so far on my legs.  </li>
            <li>It yanks those puppies out with minimal ouchage and my legs are much smoother than shaving.  </li>
            <li>It pulls the hairs out for sure, but nothing worse than plucking your eyebrows.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s totally worth it!next few days</li>
            <li>Be sure to pull your skin taut, though, otherwise it hurts considerably worse.  </li>
            <li>My hair is also growing in much more thinly.</li>
            <li>Nice disposable razors are stupidly expensive.  </li>
            <li>so I thought that this wouldn&#x27;t be an issue, but I was near tears after I used this the first time, and I only used it for one half of one leg.</li>
            <li>For the record, when I first started using an epilator at the age of 23, it was very painful and took a lot of getting used to, but eventually I adjusted and only felt mild discomfort in some more sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li>For the price, however, it will be worth it even if I only get a few months out of it.  </li>
            <li>For the price, however, it will be worth it even if I only get a few months out of it.  </li>
            <li>I sooth my skin after with an unscented moisturizer mixed with a drop of lavender essential oil which calms the skin right down.</li>
            <li>Well, here I am 5 years past our youngest child, with tons of hair follicles with double or triple hair AND much more hair follicles active because of ones stimulated by hormone shifts before/during/after pregnancy.  </li>
            <li>The first week you use an Epilady, you have to use it everyday to get your skin used to it.</li>
            <li>This one sounded like trouble from the first minute.</li>
            <li>;  You just have to stick it out for the first few sessions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>not rotating as fast, slowing down.</li>
            <li>the results of the product (when considering how much I spend on razors and shave every other day), the power cord is quite flemsy and has a short after only a week.</li>
            <li>It does take a little while to get all the hair, especially if the hair is shorter but overall i absolutely recommend it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;After first use, only a few hairs grew back, and that was after two weeks.</li>
            <li>I really like this little guy.</li>
            <li>I found that if I just do little bits at a time the pain is very manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this product simple to use and don&#x27;t have to shave everyday this is a keeper!!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: it&#x27;s still working great, BUT the stupid plug keeps coming out of the end while I&#x27;m using it.</li>

            <li> Not that great of a product.</li>
            <li> I am really glad to return to the Epilady and especially glad I found this model!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it to good effect on my underarms, and it worked great on my arms, which I hadn&#x27;t ever shaved.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m thrilled!  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for a really good hair removal item</li>
            <li> Medicating in advance will be good too.  </li>

            <li> Does a good job on legs and underarms.  </li>
            <li> I believe this is as good as it gets.</li>
            <li> Good value for the price</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this item in the mail since I have owned an epilady years ago and it worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I surprisingly love this!  </li>
            <li> I am pretty impressed.</li>
            <li> Hurt like hell the first couple of times, but has been wonderful and mostly painless since!  </li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li> I am even able to shave my bikini line with it!</li>
            <li> BUT, if you then get the hand-me-down Epilady...you will love it!</li>
            <li> But as for now, this is a Great purchase at a great price for a 1st timer; and if you dont have as much hair</li>
            <li> Good luck :)</li>
            <li> Still, this really is the best bang for your buck, so</li>
            <li> No, it is NOT painless, though it does allow you to go at your own pace.  </li>
            <li> Just keep a pair of tweezers handy for any renegades.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> Yes, I am a man with very hairy arms and chest and does a perfect job!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never waxed or done any kind of epilating before</li>
            <li> It also came with a Perfect Angle Guide (nice surprise) to allow a new user practice the correct angle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to handle and manipulate.</li>
            <li> So far its an awesome product.</li>
            <li> It works great under the arms and around the knees exactly where I need it to.  </li>
            <li> Works better sometimes than others.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs, but gets most of them.  </li>
            <li> I will buy one more as a backup, just in case.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to shave my thighs, since its once a month anyway :)</li>
            <li> Especially great for sunny vacations - no red bumps!</li>
            <li> and so glad after checking every item and reading lots of reviews I purchased this Epilady.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many epilators over the lat 15 years, they always break at some point.  </li>
            <li> mostly have relied on shaving with a triple blade razor, and have had my legs waxed maybe 10 times over the years too.  </li>
            <li> ok but is now loosing power.</li>
            <li> ok I guess.</li>
            <li> I started this time with this inexpensive model because I wasn&#x27;t sure I would be able to become re-accustomed to the pain.  </li>
            <li> From my experience and based on my observation it takes preparedness and practice to be worthwhile and to learn in order to not end up with ingrown hairs or upset skin.  </li>
            <li> With that said, I believe this epilator is currently better than the others we&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying the better version of this in hopes it will remove underarm hair more efficiently.</li>
            <li> It did, however, promote considerably more hair growth.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s cheap and not as nice a product as I have had from Epilady</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels as it removes the hair</li>
            <li> It is much more time effcient &amp;</li>
            <li> Love it and buy it</li>
            <li> Also, 40 tweezers gets more hair per stroke than the 20 tweezer varieties.</li>
            <li> Many people have attested that corded devices have both a longer life and stronger power than cordless varieties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> once a week is all i  need love it&#x27;</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write a lot of reviews, but there were so many conflicting reviews on these</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a good quality product at a reasonable price, and an excellent choice for hair removal.  </li>
            <li> Never was happy with the replacement brand but paid too much money (all the bells and whistles - light, rechargeable, etc) to throw it out.</li>
            <li> What it didn&#x27;t get last week, it gets this week, and best of all, even though not all the hair comes out, my legs stay smooth from week to week.</li>
            <li> The tweezer head rotates in a way that the gaps change width, so it&#x27;s very easy to clean when you are done.  </li>
            <li> So far, this product is working great.</li>
            <li> So far, this one&#x27;s working great.</li>
            <li> This epilator is pretty loud, not the best for discreet usage.</li>
            <li> It was so comfortable I ended up taking off more than I planned...</li>
            <li> Good quality product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> ever since my good old Brown epilator died (after many long years, to be fair) I&#x27;ve been looking for a good replacement.</li>
            <li> easy was the experience of using it on my underarms.  </li>
            <li> It works just as good as it says and doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as my older one.</li>
            <li> if you are looking at trying epilating out for the first time, this is a great product to try out since you won&#x27;t be losing too much if you can&#x27;t handle the method.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight and easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> This one has a neat little head that helps you adjust the angle to get the best results.</li>
            <li> I love my epilady (can even use on bikini area if you&#x27;re careful and brave)</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s cheaper than waxing and my legs stay smooth for days.</li>
            <li> Easy to handle and clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Great product have used it for years this is my 2nd one.</li>
            <li> It is what you can expect from a cheap epilator.</li>
            <li> if I wanted smooth legs to go out at night.</li>
            <li> It even comes with two caps, one with a guide on it to help you hold it in the correct position until you get comfortable with using it.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re shaving an area where the skin isn&#x27;t taut, use your free hand to pull the skin smooth</li>
            <li> So far so good-</li>
            <li> I read on someone else&#x27;s review to use Dove deodorant  after using the Epilady to prevent in-grown hairs and so far so good.</li>
            <li> I have used another epilator (by Bliss/Philips) and this one is far superior.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with my new Epilator.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re smooth and clean after using.  </li>
            <li> no man comes all smooth and clean shaven.  </li>
            <li> Not as nice as the older model Epilady but does the job.</li>
            <li> This new (to me) model is awesome and totally deserves the 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s super easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li> This epilator has more tweezers than some brands and they seems pretty</li>
            <li> and it has not disappointed me yet on any of these</li>
            <li> I was excited to use it, but didn&#x27;t know what was the correct way to use it, when I figured it out</li>
            <li> I had one of the original Epilady&#x27;s with the spinning, rotating wire loops.  </li>
            <li> Lay out a towel as hair does not collect anywhere and the clean up will be aggravating.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it 3 times since receiving it, but I am very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> Wow do I love this product!  </li>
            <li> Each one broke right after the warranty expired (of course!).  </li>
            <li> Older models I have owned were much better than what is currently available.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve read such wonderful reviews on epilating in general that I thought I would give this a try.</li>
            <li> I decided for the price to give an electric tweezer one more try, to see if I could manage something at home where I stay smooth for more than 36 hours, and maybe get rid of some of those double hairs.  </li>
            <li> as I do then youll probably love it also &amp; have a much better lasting experience with this product.</li>
            <li> My hair grows quickly, too.&lt;br /&gt;Pain</li>
            <li> I just went over it quickly in a circular pattern, and my skin felt numbed.  </li>
            <li> This one is corded, and has ample power to do the job quickly.</li>
            <li> Quick touch up does it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy enough to keep clean (very important for the armpit area).  </li>
            <li> Works great on the upper lip also, but be sure to use it on the low setting.</li>
            <li> It lasts quite a while, and it allows easy maintenance without making appointments or setting aside large blocks of your time.</li>
            <li> I had to buy a new one and wasn&#x27;t quite sure whether to buy this one or not, and let me say thank God</li>
            <li> For my legs, however, I am IN LOVE with this new option, and would pick it over shaving any day, given the results and longevity.er, I am IN LOVE with this new option, and would pick it over shaving any day, given the results and longevity.</li>
            <li> No red bumps, no five o&#x27;clock shadows!&lt;br /&gt;NO MORE SHAVING!</li>
            <li> 3 years old, decided I needed a new one because the Remington just wasn&#x27;t working that good anymore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times &amp; it works great.  </li>
            <li> WAY better than the old style.  </li>
            <li> however, pain was worth it for me.</li>
            <li> Totally worth</li>
            <li> It helped an old pro like me. :-)</li>
            <li> All in all, it&#x27;s worth a try to see if it works for you.</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s worth it...</li>
            <li> I will say that I believe I made the right purchase; it didn&#x27;t break the bank, and works quite well.  </li>
            <li> I followed the instructions to hold the skin taut and use the right angle shown in the picture, it still did not pick up the hair.</li>
            <li> These are so underrated as an easy, relatively pain free, and inexpensive hair removal tool.  </li>
            <li> able to use this on my legs, underarms and bikini area (if using this in a sensitive area, remember to use the guard and hold skin taut!), but I have no need to use it on my face or arms, so I can&#x27;t really say how well it works on those areas of the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> I own another epilator, a larger, dual-head model, for removing hair from arms and legs, because it is fast and removes hair from a large patch with each stroke.  </li>
            <li> Using this Epilday on the high speed in constant oval motion, I was able to complete both lower legs &amp; knees in under 15 minutes with nothing more than discomfort.  </li>
            <li> Not lying, first use for underarms</li>
            <li> is reduced after first use.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;After first use, time taken is reduced, too.</li>
            <li> When I first turned on, it scared me out of my skin.</li>
            <li> It hurt so much!  </li>
            <li> I will probably do my underarms one or two more times, to help remove all the double/triple hairs, but not on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> I have been using an epilator since they were first sold in the U.S. in the 80s, I think.  </li>
            <li> there&#x27;s still more left to do.  </li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this Epilady to a friend!</li>
            <li> First time out 27 some years ago)</li>
            <li> results are better when you shave with a regular razor.  </li>
            <li> I switched to another epilator after my first Epilady died.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my legs for more than 40 years and I&#x27;m part Roma, so I had to shave daily, twice a day</li>
            <li> If it got all of the hair without me having to go over my legs so many times, then I would have given it 5 stars, but I won&#x27;t go back to shaving.</li>
            <li> It does take time to do large areas, but you CAN use this on your private areas relatively safely.  </li>
            <li> My original Epilady was about 15 years old when it needed replacement.  </li>
            <li> I went to plug in my old, trusty Epilady, using what I thought was a safe adaptor, and it got completely fried.  </li>
            <li> I think this one, the Epilady EP-810-44 must be the updated version of my old Epilady, and it works so much better and is so much quieter than the old one!</li>
            <li> Works so much better than shaving and lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> Sometimes will not remove very fine short hair but in general does all right.</li>
            <li> Got this one because it is small and will fit better in luggage.  </li>
            <li> This one seems less effective.  </li>
            <li> It hurts less than waxing, though, and if you do your own waxing, you will appreciate how you don&#x27;t have to DREAD ripping the sheet off and cleaning up all the tacky</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a first time user, buy the cheapest model you feel comfortable with and try it out before committing to a larger investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took off the thick hairs on my legs and arms pretty good</li>
            <li> This is my second epilady - my first one is probably 5 years (or older) and still going strong.  </li>
            <li> good while worked but did not last very long</li>
            <li> girlfriend loved it.&lt;br /&gt;Not to use everyday, no skin irritation, yes some pain, but skin remain soft for days!</li>
            <li> I used this particular epilator for the first time a couple of weeks ago, and it was as if I had never stopped using one.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I much prefer not having a battery that will eventually cease holding a charge.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as well as waxing because this just doesn&#x27;t pull the hair out as fast.</li>
            <li> I really like it though and will probably get an upgrade to replace.</li>
            <li> Not like the very 1st coiled wire one.</li>
            <li> Yes, let&#x27;s be real---</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this epilator!</li>
            <li> Really, that was how I started.  </li>
            <li> TWO:  Real improvement.  </li>
            <li> The frequency to need its service negates the need to have it charged and ready at any time.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really pluck much hair off .</li>
            <li> It kind of felt like the buzziness of a TENS pad, if you have ever used those in physical therapy, totally tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have determined that single-headed epilators get the job done just as well since the dual headed ones prove to be unreliable, and when the dual headed ones break, their single head doesn&#x27;t do as good a job as one that was designed to have a single head.  </li>
            <li> I was very pleased, little to no mess comparatively to waxing.</li>
            <li> Moreover, the brush makes it much easier to remove the hairs that may get inside and treats it gently so that you can be sure you won&#x27;t mess with anything.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more picky about angle than my braun and takes a little more effort to get almost every hair, but it also costs half as much.  </li>
            <li> Hurts just as much, but I can live with it to get the hair gone for an extended amount of time.</li>
            <li> It does pinch, slightly, but its not \\&quot;painful\\&quot; as many people suggest w/ epilators.</li>
            <li> The EP-810-44 is even more efficient and faster to use than my previous corded Epilady.  </li>
            <li> Works a lot faster than the older spiral models did.  </li>
            <li> It was ok last only 9 months but while it did work it was</li>
            <li> I first started using an epilator in my first year of law school at the age of 23, and I continued doing so for about ten years.  </li>
            <li> The instructions are a bit lacking so below is a step by step that I&#x27;ve done that is working w/ this particular model.  </li>
            <li> Knees and where the thigh meets the pelvis are the most difficult and will take many passes so be patient.  </li>
            <li> braun has discontinued all their high end corded models.  </li>
            <li> Pull skin taught and begin on the HIGH speed in an oval motion from the ankle up, I imagined \\&quot;wax on, wax off\\&quot; from Karate Kid.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if my expectations are just way too high</li>
            <li> After the two with dual heads broke, I was able to continue using them for a little while with just one head (one I&#x27;m still using on my legs).  </li>
            <li> So far the quality seems okay, and it certainly does the job, but I don&#x27;t know how long it will last.  </li>
            <li> So far the quality seems okay, and it certainly does the job, but I don&#x27;t know how long it will last.  </li>
            <li> It would seem I&#x27;m either not flexible enough to stretch my skin in the right direction, user error, or</li>
            <li> One of the head guards it comes with makes it easy to get the angle right at least.  </li>
            <li> I only use it on my lower leg since upper leg hair is fine and it doesn&#x27;t seem to quite get it all.</li>
            <li> so I had to purchase a new epilator.  </li>
            <li> I put off buying a new one because of the unfavorable exchange rate, and then by the time I returned to the U.S.</li>
            <li> I literally can&#x27;t live without this.</li>
            <li> Then about two months ago I actually sat down and calculated how much I was spending on overpriced razor catridges, and I decided that an Epilady was a much better investment.  </li>
            <li> I bought this little guy months ago, and loved it starting about the second time I used it.</li>
            <li> If you wax, the pain is pretty similar (you get used to it!)</li>
            <li> I remember the original epilady and the rotating coils, and my total confusion as to how anyone could tolerate doing that to themselves on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I can only wonder if a more expensive model would be more thorough?  </li>
            <li> With the epilady, it&#x27;s more subtle and you can go much longer between shaves.</li>
            <li> The first time we tried this we realized that we had to make several sweeps of the hair to completely remove the hair.  </li>
            <li> a  little tingle andmylegs  and face stay smooth for  days  hopefully  as i have had this for a month  </li>
            <li> The only reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is they could have made the head a little wider to get more hairs at once.  </li>
            <li> A swipe of Tendskin, though, and some ibuprofen helped clear it up in a couple of hours.  </li>
            <li> So get your zen on and clear your mind during use.  </li>
            <li> I was shopping for a replacement, and was surprised at how much epilators have gone up in price since purchasing my last one!</li>
            <li> This is the clear winner.</li>
            <li> That being said, I use this sucker by Epilady on my armpits and it does a fantastic job!  </li>
            <li> so i don&#x27;t look so old</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re trying this for the first time don&#x27;t wait until the hair gets too long.  </li>
            <li> If the hair is 1/4 inch it will bring tears to his eyes, so it really needs to be short to be tolerable.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s loud</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old Epilady that stopped working after about 9 years of use.</li>
            <li> and I replaced my old epilady</li>
            <li> Bought for my 95 year old mother.</li>
            <li> Pulling the skin taut also reduces the pain considerably.</li>
            <li> i  surprised i dont feel anything</li>
            <li> I am so much happier with the physical appearance of my skin.  </li>
            <li> My wife has used one for many years, and our granddaughter has been borrowing hers,for the last few months,so we got her one for Christmas.</li>
            <li> TESTED AND LOVE IT - for all those with THICK hair - this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> Pain isn&#x27;t worth it and thin hair is harder for the Epilady to grasp and effectively remove.</li>
            <li> But you need to do your homework in order to avoid this, which means: exfoliate, moisturize, take a hot shower and dry off before epilating, and remember to pull the skin taut on EVERY area you go over-</li>
            <li> It clearly doesn&#x27;t run as fast and maybe it doesn&#x27;t need to, but as a result is sounds a little funny.  </li>
            <li> Overall, much less expensive than buying replacement razor cartridges, and much, much more effective.</li>
            <li> I tried to do my lip but this item is a bit too large and awkward for that...and much too large to precisely do the eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Even though this new one is similar to the design of the last non-Epilady model, I am so much happier with it.</li>
            <li> TAUGHT is key here and keep speed at HIGH.  </li>
            <li> the only drawback I can think of is the cord isn&#x27;t very long, so getting a rechargeable one might be worth considering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just purchased this item and have never used an epilator before; needless to say that I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It isn&#x27;t very efficient and takes a long time to do a thorough job&lt;</li>
            <li> Normally after I shave my legs by the second day</li>
            <li> I was very red and irritated in my underarms after, as compared to leg skin remaining smooth and pale.  </li>
            <li> This is ok if you want something less expensive and to do light hair removal jobs.</li>
            <li> after a few passes on HIGH, set speed to LOW and make a few more passes.  </li>
            <li> Change the angle frequently or move the device in a circular pattern, since hair often grows in different directions.  </li>
            <li> Both work very well, but the larger, dual-head model does not work well on the smaller areas such as knees, underarms, etc.</li>
            <li> I have spent so much time using this on my legs and still have stubble.</li>
            <li> but I only needed to use it twice so far on my legs.  </li>
            <li> It yanks those puppies out with minimal ouchage and my legs are much smoother than shaving.  </li>
            <li> It pulls the hairs out for sure, but nothing worse than plucking your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s totally worth it!next few days</li>
            <li> Be sure to pull your skin taut, though, otherwise it hurts considerably worse.  </li>
            <li> My hair is also growing in much more thinly.</li>
            <li> Nice disposable razors are stupidly expensive.  </li>
            <li> so I thought that this wouldn&#x27;t be an issue, but I was near tears after I used this the first time, and I only used it for one half of one leg.</li>
            <li> For the record, when I first started using an epilator at the age of 23, it was very painful and took a lot of getting used to, but eventually I adjusted and only felt mild discomfort in some more sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li> For the price, however, it will be worth it even if I only get a few months out of it.  </li>
            <li> For the price, however, it will be worth it even if I only get a few months out of it.  </li>
            <li> I sooth my skin after with an unscented moisturizer mixed with a drop of lavender essential oil which calms the skin right down.</li>
            <li> Well, here I am 5 years past our youngest child, with tons of hair follicles with double or triple hair AND much more hair follicles active because of ones stimulated by hormone shifts before/during/after pregnancy.  </li>
            <li> The first week you use an Epilady, you have to use it everyday to get your skin used to it.</li>
            <li> This one sounded like trouble from the first minute.</li>
            <li> ;  You just have to stick it out for the first few sessions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> not rotating as fast, slowing down.</li>
            <li> the results of the product (when considering how much I spend on razors and shave every other day), the power cord is quite flemsy and has a short after only a week.</li>
            <li> It does take a little while to get all the hair, especially if the hair is shorter but overall i absolutely recommend it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;After first use, only a few hairs grew back, and that was after two weeks.</li>
            <li> I really like this little guy.</li>
            <li> I found that if I just do little bits at a time the pain is very manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this product simple to use and don&#x27;t have to shave everyday this is a keeper!!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: it&#x27;s still working great, BUT the stupid plug keeps coming out of the end while I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li> It may be because, like I said, Ive been using it for the past few days and it does seem to tangle easily.</li>
            <li> I like having the cord; my older rechargeable device wasn&#x27;t lasting long enough to even get half of my lower leg finished.  </li>
            <li> I chose this particular epilator for a few specific reasons:&lt;br /&gt;-it is corded</li>
            <li> Okay, I have to say I was very skeptical, but I was pleasantly surprised how well this actually works.  </li>
            <li> I specifically purchased this small, one-head epilator for removing hair from knees, underarms, hands,  and bikini line, though you can certainly use it anywhere.  </li>
            <li> and the results are as long lasting.  </li>
            <li> Cord is long enough.</li>
            <li> I find the cord is plenty long enough  to use in any location.  </li>
            <li> Tried to go back to regular shaving, but hair grows in too fast &amp; thick.</li>
            <li> Overall, much less expensive than buying replacement razor cartridges, and much, much more effective.since hair often grows in different directions.  </li>
            <li> Legs and arms are pretty painless but under arms and the bikini area are a little more painful.</li>
            <li> my legs; and use smaller single wheel ones for my underarms, and pubes.</li>
            <li> the first time you do it, it will take a few minutes on each arm and for the next few days it will feel like someone punched you there.  </li>
            <li> As far as the pain goes, it does hurt a little bit but far less than waxing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only ventured with the bikini line, and like the underarms, first time sucks!</li>
            <li> My hairy little 12 year old used it on her legs, too, and loves it.  </li>
            <li> I have been waxing by myself for the longest and it could be painful at certain spots, but this is not painful for me.</li>
            <li> Product is quite effective at removing hair, but is a bit painful.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t done wet shaving in the shower for years, I only use epilator.  </li>
            <li> And the long cord keeps</li>
            <li> long gone of course.  </li>
            <li> Wish I would have ordered this a long time ago</li>
            <li> It is useless and you can use th  full size one to get any facial hair.</li>
            <li> hair - I have thin hair behind my knees and on my upper legs - feels like the most annoying prickly pain and honestly, that hair is hardly visible as it is and isn&#x27;t worth the pain to get rid of it.</li>
            <li> only reason I&#x27;m giving this four stars is because it seems slower than the other brands.  </li>
            <li> This epilady was a major let down!</li>
            <li> dry.</li>
            <li> Yes, the first time I used it was pretty darn painful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different ones by different companies (Brown, Phillips) and the search is over.</li>
            <li> All of those have a limited life.  </li>
            <li> Because that skin is not as firm as my calves and because it is hard to pull it taught, doing my underarms really stung, and I needed a break before moving from one side to the next.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll get me several years down the line</li>
            <li> but the hairs grew back in less than 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for less than two months</li>
            <li> Most of all, I can&#x27;t emphasize enough that, regardless of whether you&#x27;re a novice with an epilator or an old pro, it&#x27;s much less painful to use it after you&#x27;ve soaked in a bath or shower!  </li>

            <li> It is less expensive for starters but just as powerful and gentler at the same time.</li>
            <li> One was a single head, and the other two were dual heads.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s by far the fastest, least painful, most thorough one, and as a bonus feature:</li>
            <li> I use a regular tweezers after to get the few that were missed.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money to get the battery operated &amp;#34;delicate area&amp;#34;  with the regular Epilady.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update 2/19/13: I&#x27;ve been using this guy less and less recently.</li>
            <li> The early models were painful, but these newer models are practically pain-free and work very fast.  </li>
            <li> I felt a slight prickling in some areas, and around my ankles I had to go very slowly, but on large swathes of skin</li>
            <li> I only used it to shave my legs, and it was a long and slow process that I did once a week.</li>
            <li> It is taking me a little longer to cover the same area as I&#x27;ve covered with other single-headed epilators in less time.  </li>
            <li> Now, I have a high pain tolerance (I had a natural child birth for my first child and was praised by the staff for not getting hysterical)</li>
            <li> I decided to get this because my other epilator overheats, and I figured I&#x27;d get something to use while it cools.  </li>
            <li> Somehow or other Epilady manages to continually improve upon perfection.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for my other epilady which i had for 7 years or so</li>
            <li> My wife goes through one if these things about every other year.</li>
            <li> No thanks!</li>
            <li> No matter how often I go over my leg, in a rotating motion, at the suggested and every other angle, some hairs don&#x27;t come out.</li>
            <li> Does not come with topical anesthetic or alcohol to dull pain (that&#x27;s a joke for those that have used this).</li>
            <li> After you suck it up and do it the first time, it doesn&#x27;t hurt even nearly as bad the second time around.</li>
            <li> This is not fun to use and i got rid of it after a few tries.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item because I have dark, thick hair on various parts of my body.</li>
            <li> I have thick, dark, coarse hair on my legs, face and buttox,</li>
            <li> Im thinking that because of how thick my hair is that the motor in this product will probably go out on me sooner than later</li>
            <li> I use it every day for about 45 seconds under each arm and then wipe it down with a cotton pad with alcohol on it.  </li>
            <li> It also calms down the redness from having each hair pulled out by the root.</li>
            <li> But I hate shaving, and waxing my legs is a sticky mess, so I decided to give epilators one more try.</li>
            <li> had my other, more expensive model for almost a decade before it met a catastrophic end due to a bad electrical adaptor, but I&#x27;ve only had this one for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> had my other, more expensive model for almost a decade before it met a catastrophic end due to a bad electrical adaptor, but I&#x27;ve only had this one for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Have to shave less</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All epilators have about a year to a year and a half&#x27;s use in them if you&#x27;re faithful to use them a couple times a week.</li>
            <li> shave less and no burns or cuts.</li>
            <li> This does well on legs and underarms, and with less pain.  </li>
            <li> With the dual headed ones, one of the heads would inevitably stop spinning due to a stupid little plastic gear that was the only thing propelling that entire side.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll eventually forget all about the little tugs.</li>
            <li> 80 million little sharks nibbling on my legs.  </li>
            <li> Yes I bled a little.  </li>
            <li> But after that initial time, it&#x27;ll be just 1 minute or less every day as maintenance which doesn&#x27;t hurt at all, and no more 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, and no more red angry bumps</li>

            <li> Then about two years ago, I moved to London for a few months.  </li>
            <li> Save a few bucks and get a Remington.</li>
            <li> Waste of my money and went beyond my return date.  </li>
            <li> A few strays now and again.</li>
            <li> Results were not smooth.  </li>
            <li> It leaves little bumps for just a very little while.  </li>
            <li> Yes, there&#x27;s a little bit of pain, but nothing compared to what I&#x27;ve felt in the past.</li>
            <li> If using this for the first time, remember to do so immediately after you&#x27;ve soaked in a bath or the shower, and then hold the skin taut in areas that you find painful.  </li>
            <li> this is painful too when you first begin.  </li>
            <li> though I&#x27;d hoped the cut was closer because it states it pulls the hair from the root, I think that because of years and years of shaving, the hair isnt growing in evenly which has made me have to use it repeatedly over the past few days.</li>
            <li> My last 3 have been expensive (over $100,) and made by Emjoi, and they broke way before they should have.  </li>
            <li> It really takes care of all that annoying facial hair that you might be tired of plucking.</li>
            <li> :  If the user is not patient, excessive speed can just break hairs and not pull them.  </li>
            <li> I keep two going usually</li>
            <li> Usually in the $35-$50 range.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, and has a cord to plug into the wall so you don&#x27;t need to use batteries.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is the odor, but other than that</li>
            <li> We call it &amp;#34;mowing&amp;#34; his back, and I have to mow him twice a week just to keep it less painful.  </li>
            <li> As for the rest of that area, hair growth is in such an awkward angle</li>
            <li> Blood, pain, shoddy results?</li>
            <li> scared to try because of all the negative pain  </li>
            <li> Granted, I also have three thick hairs growing out of each follicle...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few months, and it works so well that I&#x27;m considering buying one for my legs too to replace my broken Emjoi.  </li>
            <li> hair on my legs and underarms grows quite thick and course.  </li>
            <li> This model has no power, slow rotation, doesn&#x27;t do a thing.  </li>
            <li> a slow speed</li>
            <li> NO MORE NUBS!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that doesn&#x27;t mean something&#x27;s going to tear up on it anytime</li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;ll tough that out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but after months of trying I still can&#x27;t figure out how to get it to work on my underarm or bikini area without pinching some skin or causing a ridiculous amount of ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Maybe even excruciating, but the second time I did my legs, the pain wasn&#x27;t nearly as bad.</li>
            <li> Not good for face</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just not really good for those places.</li>
            <li> Waxing isn&#x27;t too painful, but I do hate the sensation of the wax itself, and the intimacy of have a aesthetician do it (never developed enough technique to do it for myself).  </li>
            <li> Thin haired individuals -</li>
            <li> Not happy with this purchase at all.</li>
            <li> Areas that are used to waxing or tweezing are less painful than areas that are not used to this.</li>
            <li> - for those troubled by thick hair, sensitive-to-shaving skin, 10/10 would recommend!</li>
            <li> but no more painful than tweezing or waxing.</li>
            <li> So it painfully pulls it out slowly.</li>
            <li> It was a needless concern, since I find using it to be almost painless.  </li>
            <li> DID I SAY NO MORE NUBS??!!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing wrong...</li>
            <li> I do not mind that this one is corded-only as the recharge on the expensive model quit working</li>
            <li> Not for the faint of heart.</li>
            <li> The time spent verses the results leaves me very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to try one for your hair removal, unless you are one of those people who can&#x27;t even tolerate the slightest discomfort.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing for 5+ years now and was very skeptical of this type of hair removal product.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not that bad.  </li>
            <li> This item is painful...</li>
            <li> of course it&#x27;s painful; however, after using it for a while you build a tolerance.  </li>
            <li> (not as painful).</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, epilating is painful and can give you ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know this was going to be so painful!</li>
            <li> It is very painful and it make bumps for atleast for a week or two</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This Epilady is horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It hurts. A lot. But it&#x27;s cheaper than waxing and my legs stay smooth for days. I only use it on my lower leg since upper leg hair is fine and it doesn&#x27;t seem to quite get it all. Stop bein a wimp and get one. I love my epilady (can even use on bikini area if you&#x27;re careful and brave)</li>
            <li> I love it!  It is faster than the last one I ordered, the legend.</li>
            <li> Works better sometimes than others. I downgraded and shouldn&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item because I have dark, thick hair on various parts of my body. This items works wonderful on my legs, underarms, bikini line, and even my fingers and toes! I don&#x27;t recommend it for the face. I tried to do my lip but this item is a bit too large and awkward for that...and much too large to precisely do the eyebrows. It would work well for the chin, neck, and cheeks. This item is painful...you are pulling the hair out by the root after all...but no more painful than tweezing or waxing. Areas that are used to waxing or tweezing are less painful than areas that are not used to this. This item pulled even the shortest hairs out by the root. I was very impressed! I used a back and forth motion as well as a circling motion depending on the hair growth. It&#x27;s wonderful not having five o&#x27;clock shadow on my legs and underarms! :) Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just purchased this item and have never used an epilator before; needless to say that I am very pleased with my purchase. I have thick, dark, coarse hair on my legs, face and buttox, though I&#x27;d hoped the cut was closer because it states it pulls the hair from the root, I think that because of years and years of shaving, the hair isnt growing in evenly which has made me have to use it repeatedly over the past few days. I will say that although Im happy w/ the results of the product (when considering how much I spend on razors and shave every other day), the power cord is quite flemsy and has a short after only a week. It may be because, like I said, Ive been using it for the past few days and it does seem to tangle easily. Im thinking that because of how thick my hair is that the motor in this product will probably go out on me sooner than later so I will probably invest in a more expensive epilator. But as for now, this is a Great purchase at a great price for a 1st timer; and if you dont have as much hair as I do then youll probably love it also &amp; have a much better lasting experience with this product. It does pinch, slightly, but its not \\&quot;painful\\&quot; as many people suggest w/ epilators. Once you get use to it and figure out which angles work for you &amp; your hair growth you&#x27;ll eventually forget all about the little tugs. Good luck :)</li>
            <li> love it. i had an epilator for years, battery operated. love it. but decided to save on batteries i would try the corded one. love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times &amp; it works great.  It doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs, but gets most of them.  I would rather use this any day than to shave my legs or wax.  I use a regular tweezers after to get the few that were missed.  I will buy one more as a backup, just in case.</li>
            <li> I had an Epilady years ago and found this one on Amazon.  WAY better than the old style.  Works  great and you&#x27;re smooth and clean after using.  My hairy little 12 year old used it on her legs, too, and loves it.  It pulls the hairs out for sure, but nothing worse than plucking your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> The first time we tried this we realized that we had to make several sweeps of the hair to completely remove the hair.  It does work though it hurts.</li>
            <li> TESTED AND LOVE IT - for all those with THICK hair - this is the product for you. Ever since the 6th grade, no one has seen my underarms. Immediately after shaving, I&#x27;ve always had a five o&#x27;clock shadow under there. Ever since using the Epilady, I haven&#x27;t shaved! It&#x27;s been weeks. Not lying, first use for underarms I could only do one - it feels like your skin is being ripped off. Granted, I also have three thick hairs growing out of each follicle... however, pain was worth it for me. After you suck it up and do it the first time, it doesn&#x27;t hurt even nearly as bad the second time around. Or the third... or fourth... I will never go back to shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;After first use, only a few hairs grew back, and that was after two weeks. My hair grows quickly, too.&lt;br /&gt;Pain is reduced after first use. Totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;After first use, time taken is reduced, too. Underarms take a minute or two, lower legs maybe five minutes each.&lt;br /&gt;Bikini line - wahoo! No red bumps, no five o&#x27;clock shadows!&lt;br /&gt;NO MORE SHAVING! And I no longer consider laser hair removal... $$$$$ saved&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;First use - omg pain. Hurts badly, especially under arms.&lt;br /&gt;Thin hair - I have thin hair behind my knees and on my upper legs - feels like the most annoying prickly pain and honestly, that hair is hardly visible as it is and isn&#x27;t worth the pain to get rid of it. I&#x27;ll continue to shave my thighs, since its once a month anyway :)&lt;br /&gt;Genital area - I&#x27;ve only ventured with the bikini line, and like the underarms, first time sucks! BUT - eliminates five o&#x27;clock shadow, and results last. Especially great for sunny vacations - no red bumps! As for the rest of that area, hair growth is in such an awkward angle so you&#x27;d have to start from the bottom - ouch. Not sure I&#x27;ll tough that out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE - for those troubled by thick hair, sensitive-to-shaving skin, 10/10 would recommend! Thin haired individuals - I&#x27;d stick to waxing. Pain isn&#x27;t worth it and thin hair is harder for the Epilady to grasp and effectively remove. Probably would just break the hair.</li>
            <li> Okay, I have to say I was very skeptical, but I was pleasantly surprised how well this actually works.  It is ripping out body hair, so of course it&#x27;s painful; however, after using it for a while you build a tolerance.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This Epilady works just perfect! I had to buy a new one and wasn&#x27;t quite sure whether to buy this one or not, and let me say thank God I bought it because it just saved my life. It works just as good as it says and doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as my older one. Moreover, the brush makes it much easier to remove the hairs that may get inside and treats it gently so that you can be sure you won&#x27;t mess with anything.I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Wow do I love this product!  I have been looking for a really good hair removal item and so glad after checking every item and reading lots of reviews I purchased this Epilady.  It works great under the arms and around the knees exactly where I need it to.  Works great on the upper lip also, but be sure to use it on the low setting.</li>
            <li> Good quality product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Works great, must be plugged in all the time to run. No battery.</li>
            <li> I decided to get this because my other epilator overheats, and I figured I&#x27;d get something to use while it cools.  It&#x27;s more picky about angle than my braun and takes a little more effort to get almost every hair, but it also costs half as much.  One of the head guards it comes with makes it easy to get the angle right at least.  It takes a lot longer for this one to over heat too.  A big reason I got it over another braun though was it&#x27;s corded and braun has discontinued all their high end corded models.  I much prefer not having a battery that will eventually cease holding a charge.</li>
            <li> When I first turned on, it scared me out of my skin. It looked like a torture device. However, I gather up the courage and had the best hair removal session ever. This works for me. I have been waxing by myself for the longest and it could be painful at certain spots, but this is not painful for me. I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This is my second epilady - my first one is probably 5 years (or older) and still going strong.  Got this one because it is small and will fit better in luggage.  These are so underrated as an easy, relatively pain free, and inexpensive hair removal tool.  If you wax, the pain is pretty similar (you get used to it!) and the results are as long lasting.  No rashes, bumps or cuts as with shaving.  This one has a neat little head that helps you adjust the angle to get the best results.</li>
            <li> Somehow or other Epilady manages to continually improve upon perfection.  My original Epilady was about 15 years old when it needed replacement.  I was impressed and delighted with the disk shaped one I purchased; however after about 5 years the brushes were worn out.  Because  of the age of the device, I couldn&#x27;t purchase the part so I had to purchase a new epilator.  The EP-810-44 is even more efficient and faster to use than my previous corded Epilady.  The cord appears to be a bit longer to which is also a plus.</li>
            <li> It is not turn on at all, I have to return</li>
            <li> Love it! Works a lot faster than the older spiral models did.  Hurts just as much, but I can live with it to get the hair gone for an extended amount of time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many epilators over the lat 15 years, they always break at some point.  My last 3 have been expensive (over $100,) and made by Emjoi, and they broke way before they should have.  One was a single head, and the other two were dual heads.  All of those have a limited life.  Each one broke right after the warranty expired (of course!).  With the dual headed ones, one of the heads would inevitably stop spinning due to a stupid little plastic gear that was the only thing propelling that entire side.  After the two with dual heads broke, I was able to continue using them for a little while with just one head (one I&#x27;m still using on my legs).  I have determined that single-headed epilators get the job done just as well since the dual headed ones prove to be unreliable, and when the dual headed ones break, their single head doesn&#x27;t do as good a job as one that was designed to have a single head.  That being said, I use this sucker by Epilady on my armpits and it does a fantastic job!  It&#x27;s also easy enough to keep clean (very important for the armpit area).  I use it every day for about 45 seconds under each arm and then wipe it down with a cotton pad with alcohol on it.  I&#x27;ve had this for a few months, and it works so well that I&#x27;m considering buying one for my legs too to replace my broken Emjoi.  It&#x27;s already paid for itself IMO, but I will report back if it breaks before the one-year mark.  The only reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is they could have made the head a little wider to get more hairs at once.  It is taking me a little longer to cover the same area as I&#x27;ve covered with other single-headed epilators in less time.  Still, this really is the best bang for your buck, so if you are looking at trying epilating out for the first time, this is a great product to try out since you won&#x27;t be losing too much if you can&#x27;t handle the method. Just a note for beginners who want to do armpits- the first time you do it, it will take a few minutes on each arm and for the next few days it will feel like someone punched you there.  But after that initial time, it&#x27;ll be just 1 minute or less every day as maintenance which doesn&#x27;t hurt at all, and no more 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, and no more red angry bumps like I used to get from shaving, so it&#x27;s totally worth it!next few days it will feel like someone punched you there.

            <li> Works great once you get the hang of it!</li>
            <li> Did not like it hurts</li>
            <li> This is not fun to use and i got rid of it after a few tries. I went back to shaving. This thing always left my skin red and sometimes bleeding. It doesn&#x27;t work as well as waxing because this just doesn&#x27;t pull the hair out as fast. So it painfully pulls it out slowly. Not worth it. I&#x27;d rather be hairy.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for my other epilady which i had for 7 years or so and it worked great.  This one seems less effective.  don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a narrower blade face or what .. but i should&#x27;ve gone with the upgraded model .</li>
            <li> I last used an electric tweezer type machine 20+ mumble years ago.  I remember the original epilady and the rotating coils, and my total confusion as to how anyone could tolerate doing that to themselves on a regular basis.  It hurt so much!  Well, not anymore.  This new (to me) model is awesome and totally deserves the 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mostly have relied on shaving with a triple blade razor, and have had my legs waxed maybe 10 times over the years too.  Waxing isn&#x27;t too painful, but I do hate the sensation of the wax itself, and the intimacy of have a aesthetician do it (never developed enough technique to do it for myself).  Well, here I am 5 years past our youngest child, with tons of hair follicles with double or triple hair AND much more hair follicles active because of ones stimulated by hormone shifts before/during/after pregnancy.  I decided for the price to give an electric tweezer one more try, to see if I could manage something at home where I stay smooth for more than 36 hours, and maybe get rid of some of those double hairs.  Using this Epilday on the high speed in constant oval motion, I was able to complete both lower legs &amp; knees in under 15 minutes with nothing more than discomfort.  I did not even need to stretch the skin.  It kind of felt like the buzziness of a TENS pad, if you have ever used those in physical therapy, totally tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less easy was the experience of using it on my underarms.  Because that skin is not as firm as my calves and because it is hard to pull it taught, doing my underarms really stung, and I needed a break before moving from one side to the next.  I was very red and irritated in my underarms after, as compared to leg skin remaining smooth and pale.  A swipe of Tendskin, though, and some ibuprofen helped clear it up in a couple of hours.  I will probably do my underarms one or two more times, to help remove all the double/triple hairs, but not on a regular basis.  Medicating in advance will be good too.  For my legs, however, I am IN LOVE with this new option, and would pick it over shaving any day, given the results and longevity.er, I am IN LOVE with this new option, and would pick it over shaving any day, given the results and longevity.</li>
            <li> work great to get the peach fuzz off my face so i don&#x27;t look so old</li>
            <li> good while worked but did not last very long</li>
            <li> ok but is now loosing power. not rotating as fast, slowing down. I really like it though and will probably get an upgrade to replace.</li>
            <li> It was a great purchase.My wife has used one for many years, and our granddaughter has been borrowing hers,for the last few months,so we got her one for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I had never tried an epilator before, and was unsure of what to expect.  I will say that I believe I made the right purchase; it didn&#x27;t break the bank, and works quite well.  However, if you haven&#x27;t tried epilating before, take this into consideration:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. No, it is NOT painless, though it does allow you to go at your own pace.  It hurts less than waxing, though, and if you do your own waxing, you will appreciate how you don&#x27;t have to DREAD ripping the sheet off and cleaning up all the tacky wax.&lt;br /&gt;2. It isn&#x27;t perfect.  You may have to run a couple of times over at different angles to get every hair.  Just keep a pair of tweezers handy for any renegades.&lt;br /&gt;3. It does take time to do large areas, but you CAN use this on your private areas relatively safely.  Be sure to pull your skin taut, though, otherwise it hurts considerably worse.  Use a mirror to help you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Overall, this is a good quality product at a reasonable price, and an excellent choice for hair removal.  It lasts quite a while, and it allows easy maintenance without making appointments or setting aside large blocks of your time.</li>
            <li> It was ok last only 9 months but while it did work it was ok I guess. Easy to handle and clean. I purchase a different type after this one stop working. And I am very happy with it. This is ok if you want something less expensive and to do light hair removal jobs.</li>
            <li> Wow! A bit uncomfortable but much better than trying to pluck individual hairs.  I use it on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> Always buy THIS.&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend loved it.&lt;br /&gt;Not to use everyday, no skin irritation, yes some pain, but skin remain soft for days!</li>
            <li> Seems to clip the hair off, instead of eplilating it. Not like the very 1st coiled wire one.</li>
            <li> works well, it would be perfect if it was cordless</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy to have an epilator again!  I&#x27;m of Southern European/Mediterranean extraction, so hair on my legs and underarms grows quite thick and course.  I have to shave my legs every morning, and sometime if I go out in the evening I&#x27;ll shave a second time.  I first started using an epilator in my first year of law school at the age of 23, and I continued doing so for about ten years.  Then about two years ago, I moved to London for a few months.  I went to plug in my old, trusty Epilady, using what I thought was a safe adaptor, and it got completely fried.  I put off buying a new one because of the unfavorable exchange rate, and then by the time I returned to the U.S. I had grown accustomed to the routine of shaving.  It was out of sight, out of mind.  Then about two months ago I actually sat down and calculated how much I was spending on overpriced razor catridges, and I decided that an Epilady was a much better investment.  I started this time with this inexpensive model because I wasn&#x27;t sure I would be able to become re-accustomed to the pain.  It was a needless concern, since I find using it to be almost painless.  For the record, when I first started using an epilator at the age of 23, it was very painful and took a lot of getting used to, but eventually I adjusted and only felt mild discomfort in some more sensitive areas.  I used this particular epilator for the first time a couple of weeks ago, and it was as if I had never stopped using one.  I felt a slight prickling in some areas, and around my ankles I had to go very slowly, but on large swathes of skin I just went over it quickly in a circular pattern, and my skin felt numbed.  It removed all the hair, and almost two weeks later I still haven&#x27;t needed a touch-up.  If using this for the first time, remember to do so immediately after you&#x27;ve soaked in a bath or the shower, and then hold the skin taut in areas that you find painful.  Change the angle frequently or move the device in a circular pattern, since hair often grows in different directions.  Most of all, I can&#x27;t emphasize enough that, regardless of whether you&#x27;re a novice with an epilator or an old pro, it&#x27;s much less painful to use it after you&#x27;ve soaked in a bath or shower!  It makes a world of difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m able to use this on my legs, underarms and bikini area (if using this in a sensitive area, remember to use the guard and hold skin taut!), but I have no need to use it on my face or arms, so I can&#x27;t really say how well it works on those areas of the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had my other, more expensive model for almost a decade before it met a catastrophic end due to a bad electrical adaptor, but I&#x27;ve only had this one for a few weeks.  So far the quality seems okay, and it certainly does the job, but I don&#x27;t know how long it will last.  For the price, however, it will be worth it even if I only get a few months out of it.  It does come with a 1-year warranty.  Overall, much less expensive than buying replacement razor cartridges, and much, much more effective.since hair often grows in different directions.

            <li> I bought this updated model to replace one that I  have had for over 10 years. Works well. Sometimes will not remove very fine short hair but in general does all right. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Works great. Have to shave less</li>
            <li> Returned it. I had a Remington that I bought at Walmart for 30 bucks. 3 years old, decided I needed a new one because the Remington just wasn&#x27;t working that good anymore. This Epilady is horrible. Tried it twice, wasn&#x27;t grabbing any hairs. So I then went to Ulta and bought a Braun for 70.00 bucks. On a whim I stopped by Walgreens, and picked up another Remington for 34.00 bucks. The Remington pulled 3 times as many hairs as the Epilady, and needless to say, I will be making a return at Ulta. Save a few bucks and get a Remington.</li>
            <li> I started using an Epilady in 1990. The first week you use an Epilady, you have to use it everyday to get your skin used to it. But after that you will never want to use a razor ever again for the rest of your life! NO MORE NUBS! This will be the third Epilday I have purchased since 1990. Even though there are similar products out there, I will always stay with Epilady brand because it has served me well! DID I SAY NO MORE NUBS??!!!!</li>
            <li> I surprisingly love this!  Yes it felt like 80 million little sharks nibbling on my legs.  Yes I bled a little.  Yes I got a bit of a rash.  But a week later I&#x27;ve still had not regrowth!</li>
            <li> It took off the thick hairs on my legs and arms pretty good but the hairs grew back in less than 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> I specifically purchased this small, one-head epilator for removing hair from knees, underarms, hands,  and bikini line, though you can certainly use it anywhere.  I own another epilator, a larger, dual-head model, for removing hair from arms and legs, because it is fast and removes hair from a large patch with each stroke.  Both work very well, but the larger, dual-head model does not work well on the smaller areas such as knees, underarms, etc., so I bought this compact Epilady.  I have been using an epilator since they were first sold in the U.S. in the 80s, I think.  The early models were painful, but these newer models are practically pain-free and work very fast.  Don&#x27;t be afraid to try one for your hair removal, unless you are one of those people who can&#x27;t even tolerate the slightest discomfort.  I haven&#x27;t done wet shaving in the shower for years, I only use epilator.  Don&#x27;t bother with a battery operated unit, they just don&#x27;t have the power. This one is corded, and has ample power to do the job quickly.</li>
            <li> So far, this product is working great. I anticipate that it will take a while to get used to since I am used to using a razor.</li>
            <li> So far its an awesome product. Very happy with the results. It really takes care of all that annoying facial hair that you might be tired of plucking. I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This can be as &amp;#34;stimulating/painful&amp;#34; as you imagine it to be.  So get your zen on and clear your mind during use.  From my experience and based on my observation it takes preparedness and practice to be worthwhile and to learn in order to not end up with ingrown hairs or upset skin.  Read and heed manufactures guidance. There is a deliberate process to using these and the post care - this may not be for every skin/hair type.  If you&#x27;re a first time user, buy the cheapest model you feel comfortable with and try it out before committing to a larger investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, with all that said, as epilators go and despite my rating, I have confidence this is a really good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Two speeds, corded.  Easy to clean.  Whirling tweezers are going to remove hair, one way or another.  Appreciate the &amp;#34;training&amp;#34; guide which the manufacturer included that attaches to the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  If the user is not patient, excessive speed can just break hairs and not pull them.  Does not come with topical anesthetic or alcohol to dull pain (that&#x27;s a joke for those that have used this).</li>
            <li> Does a good job on legs and underarms.  Not good for face</li>
            <li> Not as nice as the older model Epilady but does the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought several of these epilators in the last five years. I use these on my husband (at his request) to remove unwanted hair on his back and shoulders.  Yes, let&#x27;s be real--- no man comes all smooth and clean shaven.  It&#x27;s takes a lot of work to look that way!  With that said, I believe this epilator is currently better than the others we&#x27;ve used.  We call it &amp;#34;mowing&amp;#34; his back, and I have to mow him twice a week just to keep it less painful.  If you&#x27;re trying this for the first time don&#x27;t wait until the hair gets too long.  If the hair is 1/4 inch it will bring tears to his eyes, so it really needs to be short to be tolerable.  Hence the twice a week mowings. This epilator has more tweezers than some brands and they seems pretty sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;m giving this four stars is because it seems slower than the other brands.  It clearly doesn&#x27;t run as fast and maybe it doesn&#x27;t need to, but as a result is sounds a little funny.  I&#x27;m hoping that doesn&#x27;t mean something&#x27;s going to tear up on it anytime soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All epilators have about a year to a year and a half&#x27;s use in them if you&#x27;re faithful to use them a couple times a week. We&#x27;ve had all brands-- Emjoi, Remington, Epilady, Braun, etc.  So far, this one&#x27;s working great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing for 5+ years now and was very skeptical of this type of hair removal product. I decided to get this one and test it out before delving into more expensive models. I am pretty impressed. The instructions are a bit lacking so below is a step by step that I&#x27;ve done that is working w/ this particular model.  1. Shower and exfoliate, pat dry. Do NOT use lotion or talc before hair removal!!  2. Lay out a towel as hair does not collect anywhere and the clean up will be aggravating.  3. Pull skin taught and begin on the HIGH speed in an oval motion from the ankle up, I imagined \\&quot;wax on, wax off\\&quot; from Karate Kid.  4. Unlike waxing you can and WILL have to make several passes over the same area, always keep skin as taught as possible... after a few passes on HIGH, set speed to LOW and make a few more passes.  5. Knees and where the thigh meets the pelvis are the most difficult and will take many passes so be patient.  6. I would not recommend this model for under arms but it worked wonderfully for the bikini line, again... TAUGHT is key here and keep speed at HIGH.  7. Once finished apply lotion to reduce the follicle swelling.  I was very pleased, little to no mess comparatively to waxing. I will be buying the better version of this in hopes it will remove underarm hair more efficiently.</li>
            <li> OW! OW! OW! OW! OW!  Didn&#x27;t know this was going to be so painful!</li>
            <li> Yes, I am a man with very hairy arms and chest and does a perfect job!  Hurt like hell the first couple of times, but has been wonderful and mostly painless since!  Performs as described!</li>
            <li> wonderful product. shave less and no burns or cuts.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It removes hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It hurts... a lot&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s loud&lt;br /&gt;It hurts&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t very efficient and takes a long time to do a thorough job&lt;br /&gt;It has to be plugged in to work&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dont try to use it on your bikini line... Trust me</li>
            <li> I have spent so much time using this on my legs and still have stubble. I can sit and go over the same area over and over and over and still have stubble. The time spent verses the results leaves me very disappointed with this product. Would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this product simple to use and don&#x27;t have to shave everyday this is a keeper!!!!</li>
            <li> Really Good Product!!!!!!Works Great!!!!</li>
            <li> I had got this for my mom on her birthday since she&#x27;s been wanting one for a while. She loves it! The only bad thing is the odor, but other than that it&#x27;s really great!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if my expectations are just way too high but I have to pass over the same area about 30 times to see results. After about 40 minutes of  stinging legs there&#x27;s still more left to do.  I can only wonder if a more expensive model would be more thorough?  Also, do yourself a favor and get the cordless version!!</li>
            <li> It is very painful and it make bumps for atleast for a week or two</li>
            <li> I literally can&#x27;t live without this. Tried to go back to regular shaving, but hair grows in too fast &amp; thick. With the epilady, it&#x27;s more subtle and you can go much longer between shaves. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve been using this thing for about two weeks now. I&#x27;ve been using ripper-outers for years, I think this is #4 for me. I really like this little guy. I keep two going usually, I have the emoji optima for larger areas- my legs; and use smaller single wheel ones for my underarms, and pubes. I got this to replace the epitady duo, which recently had an accident and no longer works well. This is great for the jobs I task it with. It&#x27;ll get me several years down the line I&#x27;m sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: it&#x27;s still working great, BUT the stupid plug keeps coming out of the end while I&#x27;m using it. Aggravating!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. I don&#x27;t think any hair was removed. It did, however, promote considerably more hair growth. I have stopped using it !</li>
            <li> My wife goes through one if these things about every other year. This one sounded like trouble from the first minute. I asked her if the all did that. It would grind to a halt and stop as soon as it touched her skin. She owned a bunch of these and Epilady is one of the brands we&#x27;ve purchased. Usually in the $35-$50 range.  This one was around $35.  I sent it back once the motor started smelling like it was going to fry.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this item in the mail since I have owned an epilady years ago and it worked wonderfully. This epilady was a major let down! You have to go over the same hairs multiple times and even then this epilady did not remove the hair. I followed the instructions to hold the skin taut and use the right angle shown in the picture, it still did not pick up the hair. Not happy with this purchase at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different brands and styles of epilators over the years - or rather, tried to use them. Blood, pain, shoddy results? No thanks! But I hate shaving, and waxing my legs is a sticky mess, so I decided to give epilators one more try. I&#x27;m glad I did! Yes, there&#x27;s a little bit of pain, but nothing compared to what I&#x27;ve felt in the past. No blood, either. And the long cord keeps it going so I can finish the job in one sitting without having to recharge it. I would absolutely recommend this Epilady to a friend!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s cheap and not as nice a product as I have had from Epilady</li>
            <li> Great product have used it for years this is my 2nd one.</li>
            <li> This model has no power, slow rotation, doesn&#x27;t do a thing.  Older models I have owned were much better than what is currently available.  Epilady needs to get their act together and return to the quality they used to be.  Waste of my money and went beyond my return date.  I hope to save others from this problem.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this . No battery&#x27;s just plug in and great power .</li>
            <li> Great product! I may order another one in the future. It was delivered on time.</li>
            <li> Love it. Works so much better than shaving and lasts a really long time. I love the way it feels as it removes the hair</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this epilator! It&#x27;s small, and has a cord to plug into the wall so you don&#x27;t need to use batteries. I used twice last week and haven&#x27;t had to shave since. It does take a little while to get all the hair, especially if the hair is shorter but overall i absolutely recommend it! As far as the pain goes, it does hurt a little bit but far less than waxing. Legs and arms are pretty painless but under arms and the bikini area are a little more painful. This epilator is pretty loud, not the best for discreet usage. With that said, I would still recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> It is what you can expect from a cheap epilator. May cut the hair.</li>
            <li> First time out 27 some years ago) I decided that daily shaving was a PAIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: SESSION ONE.... this is painful too when you first begin.  You need to let the legs go native for a few days and then have the patience to do only as much as you can tolerate.  I suggest you have a bottle of wine nearby.  Really, that was how I started.  Part of a leg at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SESSION TWO:  Real improvement.  Could do an entire leg.  One glass of wine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SESSIONS THREE TO ETERNITY:  Discomfort just not there.  And the hair is gone.  And the hair gets discouraged and doesn&#x27;t grow back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am on my 3rd Epilady.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:  No hairy legs.  A few strays now and again. Quick touch up does it.  Shower time greatly reduced. No pesky bleeding cuts.  No creams to buy. No razors to pack.  No stubble.  Legs always &amp;#34;company appropriate.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS;  You just have to stick it out for the first few sessions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck.  If you stick with it, you will have happy not hairy legs.  (BTW...I am pushing 70 so it is one grooming task that I am happy to have eliminated.)</li>
            <li> Actual time it takes to use this on your legs is way too L-O-N-G.  Results were not smooth.  It is much more time effcient &amp; results are better when you shave with a regular razor.  I returned the item &amp; received a refund.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old Epilady that stopped working after about 9 years of use. I only used it to shave my legs, and it was a long and slow process that I did once a week. I was shopping for a replacement, and was surprised at how much epilators have gone up in price since purchasing my last one! I think this one, the Epilady EP-810-44 must be the updated version of my old Epilady, and it works so much better and is so much quieter than the old one! I am even able to shave my bikini line with it! (not as painful). I&#x27;ve only used it 3 times since receiving it, but I am very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> I have a no no and I replaced my old epilady, I give the epilady a thumbs up. The no no in my opinion doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Cord is long enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never waxed or done any kind of epilating before but I&#x27;ve read such wonderful reviews on epilating in general that I thought I would give this a try. I bought this little guy months ago, and loved it starting about the second time I used it. Now, I have a high pain tolerance (I had a natural child birth for my first child and was praised by the staff for not getting hysterical) so I thought that this wouldn&#x27;t be an issue, but I was near tears after I used this the first time, and I only used it for one half of one leg. The second time I used it I knew what to expect and things went along swimmingly. I found that if I just do little bits at a time the pain is very manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/19/13: I&#x27;ve been using this guy less and less recently. It&#x27;s not that the results aren&#x27;t what I want but after months of trying I still can&#x27;t figure out how to get it to work on my underarm or bikini area without pinching some skin or causing a ridiculous amount of ingrown hairs. It would seem I&#x27;m either not flexible enough to stretch my skin in the right direction, user error, or it&#x27;s just not really good for those places. It does wonders on my legs when I&#x27;ve got the time to invest. Even on my legs, though, I have to go over the same areas for about three days before getting everything. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing wrong...</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Bought for my 95 year old mother. She is very happy with it</li>
            <li> Just as described online. Love it and buy it</li>
            <li> It does a very good job of removing hair but I seem to be prone to ingrown hairs so after using it, I&#x27;m covered in ingrown hairs. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the fault of the epilady though because after using it and looking at the hairs it had pulled, I could see the roots had all been pulled along with the hair.</li>
            <li> I switched to another epilator after my first Epilady died. Never was happy with the replacement brand but paid too much money (all the bells and whistles - light, rechargeable, etc) to throw it out. It finally died and I went back to Epilady. Even though this new one is similar to the design of the last non-Epilady model, I am so much happier with it. It is less expensive for starters but just as powerful and gentler at the same time. I do not mind that this one is corded-only as the recharge on the expensive model quit working and I used it as corded for the last year of its life. The frequency to need its service negates the need to have it charged and ready at any time. At any rate, this model suits me to a T! It also came with a Perfect Angle Guide (nice surprise) to allow a new user practice the correct angle. It helped an old pro like me. :-) I am really glad to return to the Epilady and especially glad I found this model!</li>
            <li> I chose this particular epilator for a few specific reasons:&lt;br /&gt;-it is corded&lt;br /&gt;-has 40 tweezers&lt;br /&gt;-has a slow speed option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After dong lots of amazon review and epilator research, I saw that it was important to have a slow speed option because it grabs more hair from the root rather than cutting and mangling it. Also, 40 tweezers gets more hair per stroke than the 20 tweezer varieties. Many people have attested that corded devices have both a longer life and stronger power than cordless varieties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that&#x27;s why I chose this one and it has not disappointed me yet on any of these factors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, epilating is painful and can give you ingrown hairs. But you need to do your homework in order to avoid this, which means: exfoliate, moisturize, take a hot shower and dry off before epilating, and remember to pull the skin taut on EVERY area you go over- even the shins- but especially the inner thigh and bikini. Pulling the skin taut also reduces the pain considerably. I sooth my skin after with an unscented moisturizer mixed with a drop of lavender essential oil which calms the skin right down. So far so good- I believe this is as good as it gets.</li>
            <li> Works Like a charm...I wish I had one of these years ago!!</li>
            <li> Perfect!  Love it.  I had one of the &#x27;originals&#x27; back in the 80s .... long gone of course.  This one is an excellent replacement.</li>
            <li> scared to try because of all the negative pain  remarks  but i gave up  all the time feeling stubble next  day...welll.was i  surprised i dont feel anything a  little tingle andmylegs  and face stay smooth for  days  hopefully  as i have had this for a month  once a week is all i  need love it&#x27;</li>
            <li> Product is quite effective at removing hair, but is a bit painful. Not for the faint of heart. Results are, however, long-lasting.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write a lot of reviews, but there were so many conflicting reviews on these so I thought I would share my experience. I bought my Epilady about two months ago, so I have taken some time to see how it works. I&#x27;ve been shaving my legs for more than 40 years and I&#x27;m part Roma, so I had to shave daily, twice a day if I wanted smooth legs to go out at night. I read on someone else&#x27;s review to use Dove deodorant  after using the Epilady to prevent in-grown hairs and so far so good. It also calms down the redness from having each hair pulled out by the root. Yes, the first time I used it was pretty darn painful. Maybe even excruciating, but the second time I did my legs, the pain wasn&#x27;t nearly as bad. After a couple of months, it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. My hair is also growing in much more thinly. I&#x27;ve also used it to good effect on my underarms, and it worked great on my arms, which I hadn&#x27;t ever shaved. Perhaps it works best on hair that hasn&#x27;t been shaved for decades.  For some reason, the Epilady doesn&#x27;t get every hair. No matter how often I go over my leg, in a rotating motion, at the suggested and every other angle, some hairs don&#x27;t come out. So I use it once a week for about 20 minutes. What it didn&#x27;t get last week, it gets this week, and best of all, even though not all the hair comes out, my legs stay smooth from week to week. If it got all of the hair without me having to go over my legs so many times, then I would have given it 5 stars, but I won&#x27;t go back to shaving. Don&#x27;t waste your money to get the battery operated &amp;#34;delicate area&amp;#34;  with the regular Epilady. It is useless and you can use th  full size one to get any facial hair. All in all, it&#x27;s worth a try to see if it works for you.</li>
            <li> Works great and happy with it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with my new Epilator.  I&#x27;ve only had it for less than two months but I only needed to use it twice so far on my legs.  Normally after I shave my legs by the second day I&#x27;m already starting to get some growth back but not now.  It&#x27;s light weight and easy to handle.  It even comes with two caps, one with a guide on it to help you hold it in the correct position until you get comfortable with using it.  I find the cord is plenty long enough  to use in any location.  Yes, you can feel it pinching as it removes the hair but it&#x27;s not that bad.  I would definitely recommend this product, especially at this price.</li>
            <li> It came on time...I was excited to use it, but didn&#x27;t know what was the correct way to use it, when I figured it out oh boy the pain, yes the pain, but I think it&#x27;s worth it...If you&#x27;re thinking about getting one, this one would be great.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really pluck much hair off . Not that great of a product.</li>
            <li> Good value for the price</li>
            <li> I have used another epilator (by Bliss/Philips) and this one is far superior.  I like having the cord; my older rechargeable device wasn&#x27;t lasting long enough to even get half of my lower leg finished.  This does well on legs and underarms, and with less pain.  Also:  it&#x27;s super easy to clean. The tweezer head rotates in a way that the gaps change width, so it&#x27;s very easy to clean when you are done.  I&#x27;d buy this over and over again.</li>
            <li> ever since my good old Brown epilator died (after many long years, to be fair) I&#x27;ve been looking for a good replacement. I&#x27;ve tried a few different ones by different companies (Brown, Phillips) and the search is over. This is the clear winner. It&#x27;s by far the fastest, least painful, most thorough one, and as a bonus feature: it&#x27;s quiet. It was so comfortable I ended up taking off more than I planned... the only drawback I can think of is the cord isn&#x27;t very long, so getting a rechargeable one might be worth considering.</li>
            <li> Wish I would have ordered this a long time ago</li>
            <li> No matter how much a 12 year old tells you she wants one of these to &amp;#34;save time&amp;#34; after you&#x27;ve explained the details of how the product works in gory detail, you should reconsider purchasing for them.  BUT, if you then get the hand-me-down Epilady...you will love it!</li>
            <li> I had one of the original Epilady&#x27;s with the spinning, rotating wire loops.  I decided to try this version and I&#x27;m thrilled!  It feels like a lightweight electric shaver but it works wonderfully. It&#x27;s very easy to handle and manipulate. It&#x27;s also incredibly affordable.  Nice disposable razors are stupidly expensive.  This Epilady is made for a woman&#x27;s smaller hands.  It yanks those puppies out with minimal ouchage and my legs are much smoother than shaving.  It leaves little bumps for just a very little while.  I wait about 10 minutes and apply moisturizer.  I am so much happier with the physical appearance of my skin.  No bumps, burns, nicks or irritation.  I will never go back to a razor.  I&#x27;ve used it on my legs and underarms.  Only one word of caution.  If you&#x27;re shaving an area where the skin isn&#x27;t taut, use your free hand to pull the skin smooth so it doesn&#x27;t get caught in the yanking mechanism-yow!</li>
