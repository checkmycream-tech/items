            <li> The product is fine but a little too flossy even when its cold and when its hot it&#x27;s pretty hard to lay...</li>
            <li> This was probably an old stock or whatever, it is so sticky that it is very hard to get it out of my skin.</li>
            <li> Awful, it pretty much burns my skin.</li>
            <li> it does not work on thick hair.</li>

            <li> It is a good wax very similar to the Italian brand I was used to use. It melts quite soon..</li>
            <li> Worked for me! Soft legs for several days are back!</li>
            <li> Love it !! So easy and clean ! Also fast shipping !</li>
            <li> Works very well,excellant product. I will not buy different product. Easy to use and clean with baby oil. Wish it was sold in stores as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for strong hair. The wax doesn&#x27;t last very long, but the skin is very smooth and moisturized after waxing</li>
            <li> I wish there is an option to mark as worst. I have used such wax cartridges many times before, and i never had any problem with them. This was probably an old stock or whatever, it is so sticky that it is very hard to get it out of my skin. BTW, it did not remove any hair from my body. I first thought it was my fault, and used it again. But then it took 3 hrs for me to get rid of this junk from my body.</li>
            <li> Awful, it pretty much burns my skin.</li>
            <li> This brand and this particular flavor of the four I&#x27;ve tried worked best for me. I like how it performs based on the technique I use.</li>
            <li> Will pull off the top layer of your skin! Use powder before. Very hard to wash off, does not come off with soap and water. Must purchase wax remover to remove excess wax.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t met the expectation at all.</li>
            <li> not the best quality I have every used</li>
            <li> they peel off your skin with the hair! who uses these?</li>
            <li> The product is fine but a little too flossy even when its cold and when its hot it&#x27;s pretty hard to lay...</li>
