            <li>and I have been thrilled with the results!</li>
            <li>I was more than impressed.</li>
            <li>I am really loving the InstaNatural brand!</li>
            <li>Great quality for a good price</li>
            <li>I love their products and excellent customer service provided to me.</li>
            <li>Excellent moisturizer, glad I decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, I just love it</li>
            <li>The price for this is just the best with all the science and care they have put into this cream it should cost more.</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that you get a good amount of product and the price is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>InstaNatural really packed this moisturizer with the very best of the best ingredients.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant.</li>
            <li>Unscented means that they did not add a pleasant smell, so you get whatever the components smell like.  </li>
            <li>, when something on you face has a scent, you want it to be a pleasant one.  </li>
            <li>also pleased with the scent, as it has an herbal/tropical-like scent that is very pleasant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for morning application under make-up, though because it contains an alpha hydroxy acid, it is strongly advised to use sunscreen while using this moisturizer in summer time (alpha hydroxy acid increases skin sensitivity to sun and may cause sunburns).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use and within a couple weeks you will see a difference!</li>
            <li>My face is bright and glowing.</li>
            <li>On the bright side, I guess I can use it as a hand mosturizer.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are a good quality</li>
            <li>Good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>, feels good.  </li>
            <li>No irritation at all, moisturizes well and feels good on the skin.</li>
            <li>and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li>She had family and friends tell me my skin looks good.  </li>
            <li>If it is good.</li>
            <li>Good to travel with too.</li>
            <li>Really good moisteruzer.</li>
            <li>Loved.</li>
            <li>This does not smell good at all. .</li>
            <li>I loved the neat packaging, the pump of the bottle makes it easier to use and does not cause any wastage.</li>
            <li>no smell is too much good</li>
            <li>I know my hands look and feel good.</li>
            <li>And the price is really good.</li>
            <li>I have found that the face moisturizers are just as good as the eye ones, so why buy both?</li>
            <li>Great to use for non greasy and effective skin care.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried (and loved)</li>
            <li>and I know how to pronounce them which is always a good thing.</li>
            <li>Keep up the good work.</li>
            <li>To be fair, I started the review at 3-Stars, so as to be neutral.</li>
            <li>so I need to get a good regimen going while using this</li>
            <li>because in my use, it has gone on smooth but best of all, no greasy after feel.  </li>
            <li>They offer a guarantee so that is a good thing.</li>
            <li>but I think this is a good moisturizer</li>
            <li>and I do think that it does a good job of keeping skin soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>br /&gt;It contains a lot of good ingredients</li>
            <li>/&gt;Straight talk, this is one of three Instanatural products I&#x27;ve been using and they are all good.</li>
            <li>But the good thing about this product is that you can wear it underneath your makeup and makes your face feel refreshed.</li>
            <li>and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li>Good product at a good price.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful, light weight moisturizer.</li>
            <li>3 plus ounces at a good price rather than one ounce for a fortune.</li>
            <li>Also good for knees/elbows.</li>
            <li>I loved my serums from them and maybe this is the way it&#x27;s supposed to work, but I did not like the greasy after feeling</li>
            <li>I try to take good care of my Face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;i loved it)&lt;br</li>
            <li>really good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>when you use hyaluronic acid products, you should follow with a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Good Value for your money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good after-shower body lotion and</li>
            <li>It works in good and I intend to continue using it.  </li>
            <li>I think the reason is that it is not water based, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin nice and smooth!!!</li>
            <li>Very nice texture and nice results.</li>
            <li>Creams need to have exceptional ingredients and need to have them in good quantities.</li>
            <li>Defying Moisturizer is a great product which absorbs very quickly and works great to keep my skin moisturized and hydrated.</li>
            <li>It is wonderful to have a face cream that doesn&#x27;t smell full of perfumes and dyes.</li>
            <li>I love how my face was very nice and pleasant after I used this and</li>
            <li>This moisturizer contains a remarkable combination of many of the best as well as time-proven ingredients available for improving and maintaining healthy, beautiful skin.</li>
            <li>It also  has a nice pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Also, the company is generous to their customers, and they have an exceptional customer service to boot.</li>
            <li>it absorbs into the skin quickly and performs superbly.</li>
            <li>This is another great product from InstaNatural that I love.  </li>
            <li>my skin look every day most beauty i am happy</li>
            <li>I found myself using this product more as part of my bedtime routine because after washing and removing my makeup at the end of the day, I felt my face needed some &amp;#34;nourishment&amp;#34; and this works great.</li>
            <li>One of those things is truly finding great skincare that matches the healthy foods we feed our bodies.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>

            <li>It is a nice size bottle also.</li>
            <li>I HAVE RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED FEEDBACK.</li>
            <li>Moisturizer feels nice.</li>
            <li>feels nice on the skin.  </li>
            <li>but I have been noticing a nice difference in my skin tone and texture.  </li>
            <li>my own based on my experience with the product.</li>
            <li>All opinions are my own</li>
            <li>/&gt;Received in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice when applied, and then I don&#x27;t notice it after it has been applied.  </li>
            <li>They use good ingredients, and I feel safe using their products.</li>
            <li>I gave this to my mom and she is loving it.</li>
            <li>Smells nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is kind of earthy/herbal.</li>
            <li>Smells kind of like vitamins</li>
            <li>It also leaves a nice glow on your skin.</li>
            <li>Absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li>Would be nice if it had some sun protection in it.</li>
            <li>I used this for about a month and generally liked it</li>
            <li>It is nice product.</li>
            <li>The dispenser is handy, allowing you to dispense the amount you want.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer works into the skin nicely without leaving residue on the hands.</li>
            <li>but my opinions are my own</li>
            <li>more things to make you feel good about when using this product.</li>
            <li>but this product has been really nice.</li>
            <li>I guess the best way would to say that it smells very &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and takes some time to get used to.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was thicker than I anticipated but went into the skin nicely.  </li>
            <li>All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>the scent is nice.  </li>
            <li>I put one pump of this in the palm of my hand, then add 2-3 squirts of InstaNatural&#x27;s Rose Hip Oil, mix it together and apply.  </li>
            <li>has well, coupled with the Rose Hip Oil at night before bed.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin nice and moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and I honestly cannot be happier with them.</li>
            <li>This is a decent moisturizer, but not the best one for me.</li>
            <li>But I think this moisturizer will be perfect in winter when my skin is drier, and also if I just put it on the drier areas of my face, particularly around the eye area.  </li>
            <li>This is packed full of nutrient rich ingredients that are especially good and nourishing for your skin.</li>
            <li>This is packed full of nutrient rich ingredients that are especially good and nourishing for your skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this moisturizer, mostly because of what is NOT in it.  </li>

            <li>Feels good on my face and seems to be taking away fine lines around my eyes.</li>

            <li>She liked it more than I did.  </li>

            <li>The bottle is a nice pump and I am able to control the amount I put out.  </li>

            <li>And this one is by far the best!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best moisturizer I have ever tried.</li>

            <li>Smells really good and so smooth on my face.</li>
            <li>has delivered more amazing results than any high-end department cream.</li>
            <li>and he liked the smell of it, so perhaps this is even better for the men out there who need to moisturize.</li>
            <li>This seems to be a nice product, but I got a lovely case of contact dermatitis when I used it.</li>
            <li>Love this company and their amazing products.  </li>

            <li>It has a nice consistency and goes on smoothly.  </li>

            <li>I love the scent, and I use it on my hands at night as well as my face.</li>
            <li>The smell is not my favorite</li>
            <li>Love the 2 together.</li>
            <li>My skin appeared more luminous, and who couldn’t use a bit more luminosity in their day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love the smell and it soaks in - not leaving my skin greasy</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about most of you</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I have hurt my fingers trying to get something to come out of bottles, cans, etc.</li>
            <li>and this is really awesome news for me because now I can finally use all the product up before it expires!</li>
            <li>It is also safe to use around the eyes and I have been doing that without any problems.</li>
            <li>I just used this cream for two more days.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say more about it.</li>
            <li>Will write more after I use 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>If we except that truth we can focus on making it much better.</li>
            <li>but I like radiant, healthy, and glowing skin.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t get any breakouts while using this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I like that my skin looks more hydrated and healthier.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love how it makes my skin look.</li>
            <li>I notice that my skin appears more moist &amp; healthy--younger, I would say.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>one most exercise caution.</li>
            <li>This is soooo smooth on the skin!</li>
            <li>I was pleased when I received the chance to review this product for my blog.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>so I made sure to Not do that.</li>
            <li>I used a pea size amount  (not even) on my face( one pea sized amount for the lower part of my face and another for the top part)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also using the eye gel, which I love.</li>

            <li>I like that it can be used on your face and body because I love to use it on my hands, and Decollete.</li>
            <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Defying Moisturizer Cream is an okay cream but will not solve all of your problems.</li>
            <li>I say that if you are having no age difficulties at this time (meaning that if you do not have any problems then this will be okay for you).</li>
            <li>It does not seem to be a magic cream.</li>
            <li>I love the pump top.  </li>
            <li>You are sure to find what you are looking for here.  </li>
            <li>Their prices are great and you will really get a lot for your money.  </li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>I guess I might do better with a gel based moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Love this cream.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product now for more than 7 days.</li>
            <li>Will buy more...</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t see it&#x27;s a magical power to reduce wrinkles.</li>
            <li>My wife has also enjoyed using this moisturizer in her repertoire of face creams.</li>
            <li>also love that my mineral powder foundation sticks to my skin so much better after applying this moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I am so glad I recieved this product for review.</li>

            <li>It feels wonderful on and it does make a big difference.</li>
            <li>However, the customer service is exceptional and worthy of note.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s the most luxurious-feeling cream I&#x27;ve tried and let&#x27;s just say I dabble a lot at Sephora.</li>

            <li>I have written a more detailed review on my blog thebeautyanalytic.blogspot.com</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really go for moisturizers that are scented, but my mom thought it smelled good.  </li>
            <li>My skin felt hydrated but it does sink into your skin nicely leaving no feeling stickiness like a heavier moisterizer can and because of that I have been using this in the morning after my shower then applying my foundation over it after its absorbed</li>
            <li>She is in her 50&#x27;s and need a good anti aging moisturizer that is gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li>It works good on fine lines, and it has many effective ingredients to fight the aging process and renew the skin such as hyaluronic and lactic acids, glycolic acid, and Vitamin C.</li>
            <li>This is a facial moisturizer that has a weight and thickness some were between a good hand cream and a good night cream, However it absorbs very well which makes it nice to wear morning and</li>
            <li>All in all, a good product, that did indeed provide some new life to my skin!</li>
            <li>This is great, makes my skin so smooth and soft after a day in the sun.</li>
            <li>so it is a very mild smell.</li>
            <li>I love that it is made with great nutrients such as Vitamin C and B5,  Cocoa  Butter, Aloe Vera, and Rosehip Oil.  </li>
            <li>it absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to any women who has an oily face and break out easily from makeup.</li>
            <li>so it is a very mild smell.</li>
            <li>Just like the cellulite cream, it has a dispenser which is easy to control</li>
            <li>But since I have fair skin that burns easily, using a product that makes my skin more sensitive does not work well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I was given this product free for me to review</li>
            <li>I like that it is light weight</li>
            <li>This is such a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Could be great if only they put SPF in it.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li>but as I am only using at night it works great.</li>
            <li>and so one pump is really all I need which is nice.</li>
            <li>This really fit the bill.</li>
            <li>One star is for its promotional price and nice packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product may have promising ingredients</li>

            <li>It goes onto the skin silky &amp; smoothly.  </li>
            <li>However, as I am getting to an age where moisturizers are important I decided to try this one.</li>
            <li>I was open-minded about this product, and endeavored to do an impartial, 4 week test.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so very soothing - the ingredients are great as individual ingredients, but all together are that many times better.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Obtained From: Manufacturer&lt;br /&gt;Payment: Free</li>
            <li>I would suggest giving about 15-20 min to make sure that the moisturizer has fully absorbed into skin before putting makeup on over it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also gluten free.  </li>
            <li>Cream last all day and feels great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for several months now and it is great.  </li>
            <li>Moisturizes nicely but doesn&#x27;t make a real difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I got the chance to try out this fantastic Age Defying Moisturizer</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin like me it is best to only use most moisturizers at night.  </li>
            <li>My wife uses the product every morning after her showers and says it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel smooth and free of oil.</li>

            <li>/&gt;I was sent a free sample in order to make an informed review</li>
            <li>Works great for smaller area&#x27;s at a time to see the difference.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a generous 3.4 oz of cream for your money, and you don&#x27;t need to apply a lot to get the bene fit.  </li>
            <li>so it is important to protect  your skin with a sunscreen when using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worth every penny and their customer service is top notch.</li>
            <li>I  received it for free</li>
            <li>However I have not used it in warm weather yet, and that is often the real test.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this everyday for b 3 weeks, now and am quite impressed with the results.</li>
            <li>This facial moisturizer is great.</li>
            <li>I wanted a light moisturizer cream</li>
            <li>I have been using this moisturizer in combination with InstaNatural&#x27;s Vitamin C Toner and their Vitamin C Serum with 20% Hyaluronic Acid Serum and really enjoy using all 3 products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This moisturizer contains cocoa butter and smells lightly of cocoa.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I really enjoy it at night or on my hands.</li>
            <li>This lotion goes on smooth &amp;</li>
            <li>but I did want a good moisturizer with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>have fair sensitive skin with a bit of rosacea on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>I really like the Age-Defying Moisturizer so far, it feels very rich and soothing to my skin and makes the skin around my eyes feel great and &amp;#34;relaxed&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, I didn’t notice any significant changes in fine lines or wrinkles, which is another reason that I’ll opt not to use this on my face.  </li>
            <li>I was very excited to get this product as a tryout since I love InstaNatural Age Defining Serum so much.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the InstaNatural brand and can&#x27;t wait to try out some more of their products!</li>
            <li>It is not a bad moisturizer but it has a strong smell.  </li>
            <li>but really like it!!!</li>
            <li>I have tried several brands and I love this moisturizer!!</li>
            <li>Very powerful anti-wrinkle cream.</li>
            <li>It feels very light and not thick like most body lotions.</li>
            <li>so I was happy to take advantage of a special price and try their Anti-Aging Facial Moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I am not disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;Their main list of ingredients are MSM, rose hip oil, vitamin c, cocoa butter, johoba oil, and hyaluronic</li>
            <li>The InstaNatural Age-Defying Moisturizer has an herbal scent, but it&#x27;s not too strong and fades quickly.</li>
            <li>It has a strong scent, but not unpleasant.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a significant improvement in my skin in a number of ways.</li>
            <li>Rich texture.</li>
            <li>A lightweight, non-greasy, but rich and hydrating moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It is creamy and rich, without being at all greasy.</li>
            <li>First off, the product arrived on time, which pleased me.  </li>
            <li>Works better than high end brand name moisturizers for a fraction of the price!!</li>
            <li>I apply the serum first then this cream on top.</li>
            <li>The bottle is already a generous size, so it&#x27;s well worth the money!</li>
            <li>I am ALWAYS on the search for a great moisturizer that really performs well, and most of the time I am left dissappointed.</li>
            <li>It is rich and creamy, but not greasy.  </li>
            <li>so I was concerned about using a rich product</li>
            <li>After my first application, I did notice that my skin felt more hydrated.</li>
            <li>Now, I have a complete set of this line that I am very pleased with.</li>
            <li>But even more important and incredible is that the red, blotchy areas on my cheeks and forehead have faded until they are barely noticeable!  </li>
            <li>The good news, though, is that it is long-lasting and once absorbed, leaves my skin feeling soft and silky-smooth.  </li>
            <li>Like most of the products in their product line, this one contains lots of natural and organic ingredients; many of which you would recognize.  </li>
            <li>Jojoba oil which I have found is great for more dried patches of the skin.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin very moisture and smooth love</li>
            <li>I apply at night on clean skin before bed.</li>
            <li>It seems to absorb quickly and leaves my skin smooth and firm/tight.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week, but so far I have to say that it is one of the best moisturizers I&#x27;ve used in a while.</li>
            <li>My face has never been so smooth and vibrant!!!</li>
            <li>Bouth this with serum , and makes my skin pure then befoure , love this</li>
            <li>This product is right up my alley!  </li>
            <li>Face was very dry, used the moisturizer and skin feels great.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell very good and felt heavy on my skin.</li>
            <li>While I could see mild improvement at 2 weeks, it took 4 weeks to see significant results.</li>
            <li>, it’s rich and creamy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Good cream with light odor, not irritating for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>After my wife started using the Insta Natural Youth Express Age-Defying Moisturizer, she said her skin felt amazing.</li>
            <li>This product does an amazing job of keeping my skin soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>My complexion was left looking bright and radiant, with a smoother feel.</li>
            <li>I have tried several products from Instanatural and I have loved all of them.</li>
            <li>leave face soft and nice (no oily feeling)</li>
            <li>so I can finally feel good about what I putting on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have been loving my Insta Natural Products.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it is life-changing, but the pump is convenient and the size will last you a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>Keeps it nice and soft and plump.  </li>
            <li>it is good, after use it for a week, i can feel different than before.</li>
            <li>I really have enjoyed the cream.</li>
            <li>I have used a lot of different moisturizers and am always on the alert for something good that won&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>The texture is phenomenal so it doesn&#x27;t take much per application</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>and I love that this product was both gentle and didn&#x27;t cause any problems for me.  </li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and this cream reacted nicely to it.</li>
            <li>I bought this based on the low price and good reviews.</li>
            <li>The list of ingredients takes up the entire length of the bottle, but it&#x27;s good, &amp;#34;98% natural&amp;#34; stuff:</li>
            <li>I use this one on top of my serum and it works really well and dose not pill.</li>
            <li>You can read my full review on my blog by clicking the link below  [...]</li>
            <li>I do not use a full pump of the product as that seems to be a lot of product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a shame because it us one of the top products I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>Many products either irritate my skin, or leave it very oily.  </li>
            <li>Overall a good cream</li>
            <li>It lasted a full 4 months.  </li>
            <li>Not a bad price point tho.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not a bad cream..</li>
            <li>What I love about it is that it makes my face look and feel very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>So right away I knew it was a product I would be comfortable using.  </li>
            <li>It absorbed quickly and leaves your skin very fresh and moist.</li>
            <li>Really like this cream, it goes on my face very clean.</li>
            <li>This is a rich but easily absorbed and non greasy moisturizer in a convenient pump container.</li>
            <li>It is a light cream that easily soaks into your skin, and leaves your face feeling so soft, smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li>but it quickly soaked in once I rubbed it in all the way</li>
            <li>One thing I look for in a product is how quick does it work</li>
            <li>It has a nice texture and the smell is nice and it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling or heavy feeling on your face.  </li>
            <li>cannot possibly say enough wonderful things about their products, and this age-defying moisturizer is no exception!</li>
            <li>I have tried several anti-aging facial moistutizers and this is one of the best.  </li>
            <li>apply InstaNatural Mositurizer after washing with mild cleanser and applying Vitamin C Serum.  </li>
            <li>(I have a mild case of rosacea).</li>
            <li>I love this product, it makes my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>it goes away fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>Super moisturizing and absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li>but it quickly soaked in once I rubbed it in all the way</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I love this product and would definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>and it soaks in quickly with no after-burn.</li>
            <li>This product absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t make me shiny.</li>
            <li>Blends and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>Women should know how quickly makeup / beauty products should betossed.</li>
            <li>The natural, effective, non-abrasive ingredients make it worth trying.  </li>
            <li>Overall my skin looks more even and feels somewhat better compared to just a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>They absorb quickly with no sticky feeling.</li>
            <li>applying it on the body, this absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li>Super moisturizer, my husband loves it</li>
            <li>Anyway, like I said, product is beautifully packaged until you pump a little and prepare yourself to gag with its odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it is possible that the oils kind of accumulate, but right after using exfoliator, I was fine again...    </li>
            <li>Considering the fact that the thickness of the product is what likely locks in the moisture and results in the long-lasting effects, I would say that is accurate, making it worthwhile to keep this product around, as it does what it is advertised to do, which is a HUGE factor for me when it comes to reviewing products.kness of the product is what likely locks in the moisture and results in the long-lasting effects, I would say that is accurate, making it worthwhile to keep this product around, as it does what it is advertised to do, which is a HUGE factor for me when it comes to reviewing products.</li>
            <li>Put it on in the morning after a hot shower and it just dissolves into my skin, leaving it feeling smooth and firmer.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes my skin beautifully without feeling heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>and it is not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>I started seeing some fine lines around my eyes and wrinkling that I wasn&#x27;t happy about, and this product along with other InstaNatural creams have really turned things around for my face.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s Great other than that!</li>
            <li>While this was a little heavy for my taste to use as a facial moisturizer, I am more than happy to give it 5 stars because it is an EXCELLENT eye makeup remover!</li>
            <li>I love my new face cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite and have reordered.</li>
            <li>I really love this new product line from InstaNaturals.</li>
            <li>I received an email checking in on my happiness with the products I purchased, and when I expressed my experience with this one they took the time to not only suggest another that might be a better fit, but to actually send me a complimentary bottle of it to try.</li>
            <li>I previously bought their vitamin C cream and had great results.  </li>
            <li>It rubs in easily and I don&#x27;t have to use too much.</li>
            <li>This product is absorbed quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li>Most of the ingredients look very natural without a lot of chemicals.  </li>
            <li>This is very natural in the products and healthy to the skin.</li>
            <li>Now, I want to say that just because a cream has the right ingredients does not mean that it will be a magic cream and solve all of your problems.</li>
            <li>you so much!!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>Love everything from this company so far!</li>
            <li>You’ll notice the difference after the first use!</li>
            <li>and I finally found one I love!  </li>
            <li>BUT I am loving the results enough to live with it. :)</li>
            <li>It is gentle to the skin and reduced the appearance of fine lines and age spots.</li>
            <li>experienced no breakouts whatsoever and did see a difference - a little lightening of hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li>Go get some of this and thank you instanatural for such an amazing customer service.</li>
            <li>Feels great, not too heavy or greasy for daytime use, but does the job.</li>
            <li>Fabulous product!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this anti- aging moisturizer for about a month now and my skin absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>It is very lightweight and comes in a HUGE bottle.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite things about this product is that it is 98% natural and contains NO parabens, sulfates or alcohol.  </li>
            <li>Terrific, effective ingredients;</li>
            <li>The cucumber and aloe give a fresh sensation as well.</li>
            <li>I love that the ingredients are natural and do not irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>Have to admit that it was a bit pricey but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I have also noticed that my skin is more sensitive in the sun.</li>
            <li>Well, I guess I will be paying more attention to my natural ingredients from now</li>
            <li>moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also been using it on the top of my hands because they are getting that old look to them</li>
            <li>moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also been using it on the top of my hands because they are getting that old look to them</li>
            <li>and it smells citrusy and fresh.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind using scented facial products, then this is a nice moisturizer to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>nice moisturizer overall</li>
            <li>/&gt;As noted on the container, this product will make your skin more sensitive to sunlight, so</li>
            <li>use about a dime&#x27;s size worth of cream on my face and neck after applying some vitamin C serum, and after 12 hours I can still feel the difference on my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not expecting the bags to go away completely, but I&#x27;m happy to see they aren&#x27;t as obvious as they used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice facial moisturizer that exceeded my expectation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclaimer: I was provided a complimentary sample.</li>
            <li>I have some smile lines around my mouth &amp; they are still there.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used many skincare products on my skin since I stopped having acne in my early 20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shopping around and trying out the most natural skin care possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I read the ingredients I see many natural foods and vitamins</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t evaluate them properly because I&#x27;ve been trying them for weeks, but not just this one</li>
            <li>so I cannot comment on the long term benefits of it&#x27;s use, but I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>No harsh ingredients and safe.</li>
            <li>I love that InstaNaturals products are not tested on animals and this one is 98% natural.</li>
            <li>I love The items from Insta Natural.</li>
            <li>I am pleased thus far.</li>
            <li>I have use many creams and found this one moisturized better than I expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to use more natural products for myself, but also since I&#x27;m still breast feeding my son.</li>
            <li>I understand, to withdraw the natural fragrance of a product you have to add some ingredients that are not&lt;br /&gt;so natural or good for you.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I use 5 drops per night on freshly washed face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, making this a great product and a fantastic buy for my budget:)</li>
            <li>The best thing about this cream (besides it&#x27;s awesome anti-aging ingredients) is that it comes in a pretty sizable bottle, so I don&#x27;t feel guilty using it every night not only on my face, but my neck, upper chest, and HANDS as well.  </li>
            <li>I got used to it pretty quickly, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Results are pretty quick.</li>
            <li>It also has a light, clean, natural scent.</li>
            <li>The seller got it to me right on time</li>
            <li>I was processing a return right now</li>
            <li>soaks right in.  </li>
            <li>It does kind of smell like butt for the first 30 second when you are putting it on, but that goes away.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s true that it doesn&#x27;t function as a proper moisturizer which I apply separately on top if needed.</li>
            <li>OK -- I&#x27;ve tried the whole jar and can say it is not as good as my old standard O&#x27;real Revtalift and Callogen (at night).</li>
            <li>I actually like the pump which dispenses the moisturizer because it is very easy to control.</li>
            <li>When I use it, my hair is completely tangle free and can be quickly combed through.</li>
            <li>This has a nice light smell to it, has a consistency that&#x27;s not too thin and not thick but a nice medium.</li>
            <li>sensitive skin, I am always hesitant to introduce a new product into my regimen, but this is 98% natural, and uses so many organic ingredients that I felt safe trying.  </li>
            <li>Honestly who really has the time to have separate creams for multiple uses.</li>
            <li>price is great, especially for the generous size, and I don&#x27;t see myself going back to drug store moisturizers anytime soon!</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a strong smell associated with this product as 98% of its ingredients are all natural, which is not a deterrent for use in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It has a strong scent of natural ingredients, which I like.</li>
            <li>It quickly absorbs and does the job very well.</li>
            <li>product ships quickly and is packaged really well .</li>
            <li>As far as a daily moisturizer I loved this.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin feeling smooth and soft!</li>
            <li>It soaked right into my skin and just left it feeling softer and looking better.  </li>
            <li>The packaging is great, it has a pump which I love because pumps keep the product uncontaminated by regular skin bacteria, and it is quite big, too, so it will last for a while.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.  </li>
            <li>I like it very much, it keeps my skin moist all day</li>
            <li>soft and fine lines are disappearing.</li>
            <li>Love this moisturizer it is thick and soaks into your skin quickly and leaves it moist not greasy, bought two more, one for my mom and one for my sister.</li>
            <li>As a woman on the go I need quick, easy and simple.</li>
            <li>but this magic made the dark circles disappear and the fine lines to go away too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to thank Instanatural for sending me their products to try out and for their help in meeting young waitresses and for no longer needing to shave and for being able to sing the high notes once again and.........</li>
            <li>Especially perfect if your skin is dry or you live in a dry climate like I do.</li>
            <li>One day I looked down and realized how great my left hand looked compared to my right!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel it moisturizes in the amazing manner I expected.  </li>
            <li>I use this moisturizer during the day and it makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I really love this moisturizer, It seeps instantly into the skin</li>
            <li>I love that it is ant-aging!&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>First of all, it smells funky -</li>
            <li>I will be buying several more products from InstaNatural after having used this &amp; the Vitamin C serum for about 3 weeks now.</li>
            <li>A very practical gift!</li>
            <li>It is a thicker formula that seemed to not want to soak into my skin at first.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>Her skin is so much softer and looks fresh.  </li>
            <li>Love this facial moisturizer!</li>
            <li>I use it daily bases, mostly in the morning before I put on my sunblocks.</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying the InstaNatural line</li>
            <li>Only downfall I have with it is that it could have a better smell to it.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li>The first result I noticed was around days</li>
            <li>3-5 yhe dryness was just about disappearing, my skin was soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>If it does a great job of conquering my skin care concerns, however, that’s the least of my worries.  </li>
            <li>First open ,I did not like this product the smell,After one month used this product ,I am feeling ok.</li>
            <li>Like most women (especially us over 40)</li>
            <li>Pump top seems fragile and I fear breaking it.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>Only been a couple of weeks, noticing a bit more firmness.</li>
            <li>It’s summertime and this product is exactly what I need</li>
            <li>I have been using this moisturizer for about two weeks and really like it!  </li>
            <li>After only one week I was able to see an improvement in my forehead lines and creases.  </li>
            <li>Since this cream does not have any sunscreen, it would not be my first choice.</li>
            <li>Directions say to put a serum on first</li>
            <li>it makes my skin feel soft and supple and helps to promote a wrinkle free face.</li>
            <li>how much I love the company that I decided to try another product to see if I can claim the same results and benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is fragrance free and organic just as what&#x27;s described - it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>Love this facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer does not have same wonderful smell as Age Defining Serum and rather like their SPF30, which does not smell like usual SPF at all but does not make me want to apply it at night.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very possible that twice per day application may result in greater effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I apply to my face and neck, and especially on my forehead, where there are more wrinkles.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>This product is fragrance free but don&#x27;t let that put you off; it is because of all the natural ingredients in the formula.  </li>
            <li>I tried this for a while only to find more sneaky blackheads and whiteheads forming in places</li>
            <li>I am still working on my first bottle and I am hoping the wrinkles are fading.  </li>
            <li>I neglected my skin until after menopause when I became distressingly aware of how rapidly I had aged.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>At the pharmacy, I was talking to another woman in line about hot flashes</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the first week of using it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s crucial what is LEFT OUT of the ingredients, as there are so many toxic ones in most moisturizers.</li>
            <li>I wake with soft, smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>So I would  like to know how I can give you back the product and benefit of your guarantee satisfied or money</li>
            <li>I love this facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>My complexion has really improved!</li>
            <li>It is a thicker formula that seemed to not want to soak into my skin at first.</li>
            <li>I have has so many stress related issues it&#x27;s done a number on my skin.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft, and looking smooth.  </li>
            <li>I was willing to try anything.</li>
            <li>, the smell did surprise me at first.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this product, but after several uses my skin started to break out all around my chin and my forehead.</li>
            <li>It has a lovely fragrance, which isn’t too overpowering for a facial moisturiser.  </li>
            <li>I was also pleased with the moisturizer cream and decided to use it in my daily routine.  </li>
            <li>I would have to say the results are up there with the higher priced brands.</li>
            <li>Nice and smooth moisturizing creme applied to my face, however the fragrance is not appealing to me.</li>
            <li>Unsure when this happened, but the only product I was able to use was what squirted out into the lid.</li>
            <li>Light and soft skin.  </li>
            <li>and I feel my skin is soft and smooth</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles, but I can see how the thickness of this cream helps the skin plump back up to help decrease the signs of those wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3 ;)</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and does not irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This is my 3rd InstaNatural product and as with the others I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>InstaNatural Anti-Aging Facial Moisturizer Cream has many ingredients that provides nutrients to the skin, Vitamin C, Hyaluronic Acid, Vit. B5, MSM etc.</li>
            <li>It is the same with many things that are &amp;#34;unscented.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased several products from InstaNatural and love them all.</li>
            <li>I feel this moisturizer really does what it says it will!</li>
            <li>Skin is starting to look more youthful.  </li>
            <li>For a natural product, it had a cheap, dollar store lotion smell.  </li>
            <li>It is good for oily skin as well, because it won&#x27;t clog the pores and make the skin oily after a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I had previously brought Insta Natural eye serum and gel and was completly happy with the purchase, so when my serum and moisturizer ran out, I knew I had to try this.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good for my dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It has a very pleasant fragrance that is not added artificially and it goes on light as air but really holds in the moisture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sticky like other moisturizers I have used, and you don&#x27;t need a lot for it to be effective.</li>
            <li>I had the privilege to have tried the Insta Natural Youth Express Eye Gel recently (see review HERE) and the results where amazing.</li>
            <li>the difference in my skin is that it has a prettier soft, clean look</li>
            <li>I was even asked if I&#x27;d had a facial recently (no) because my skin looks so good.</li>
            <li>and I bought this product several weeks ago because I liked the natural ingredients and hoped they would nourish my skin.  </li>
            <li>l have been using it faithfully since it arrived,so far lm pleased with the early results..  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t have the greatest smell, very earthy scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll be trying the night cream to see if I can get more long lasting moisture from using the same amount and do a review after using it for a good amount of time</li>
            <li>This facial creme is light and effective providing a powerhouse of bioavailable ingredients that you will quickly see working after just a few uses of this formula.</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve ever had something where I really did notice the difference.</li>
            <li>I have pretty good eye site but the white writing on the light yellow back ground</li>
            <li>This product has a putrid odor and very sticky consistency that prevents me from rating it higher.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought &amp;#34;I&#x27;ll never get used to this&amp;#34; but I absolutely did after about 2 weeks...</li>
            <li>At first, the product smells very funky-</li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s full with natural ingredients</li>
            <li>Love,love,love have noticed such a huge difference in my skin its not even funny.</li>
            <li>One pump from an easy pump bottle will cover the entire face and neck -</li>
            <li>You can wear this daily, it absorbs easily into the skin.  </li>
            <li>so I have also used it on the top of my hands in hopes to help with the unsightly dry appearance.</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 is because it doesn&#x27;t have an spf, and I liven Colorado where that&#x27;s pretty important.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly &amp; leaves my skin softly moisturized.  </li>
            <li>so I need for things to be easy to open and not give me hassles when trying to use.</li>
            <li>Not a fan of the slight rose odor, but works so well who cares.</li>
            <li>I dont think I would recommend this product for oily skin but dry skin for sure.</li>
            <li>I have seen some improvement, but no dramatic difference.</li>
            <li>so I think it will definitely last a good long time as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far, this amazing moisturizer has evened my skins texture and tone, and I&#x27;m sure is working in countless other ways that I cant see it am not privy to just yet.  </li>
            <li>only difference is that the high end moiturizers have a nice and soft fragrance,&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>but I certainly did not.</li>
            <li>but it certainly won&#x27;t make them worse.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has certainly helped my face and neck area.</li>
            <li>Many brown spots (from too much sun exposure), wrinkles, dry skin, and crepe like skin.</li>
            <li>There is a nice thick consistency to the moisturizer that coats the skin and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It goes on a tiny bit greasy but gets absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer goes on very rich, which I like because I have dry skin.</li>
            <li>My hands tend to crack and become dry very easily these days, but this cream leaves them feeling very soft and</li>
            <li>have some fine lines on my face, and even after a short trial I am seeing improvement in my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I do not see any difference in my facial appearance yet, still have the fine lines and age spots.  </li>
            <li>it would make my skin sensitive to the sun, but so far its been fine.</li>
            <li>You only need a little bit of the product and I love that it is safe to use around your eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This rich cream is better suited for body applications, rather than the face, unless the facial skin is extremely dry.  </li>
            <li>Such a huge container-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of Vitamin C in my facial products, especially natural products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thanks so much for providing a product for review on my blog.</li>
            <li>I use it on my forearms and I can really tell a&lt;br /&gt;difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this moisturizer, but I just can&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>IT smelled very chemical-ish.</li>
            <li>I much prefer the night cream over this.</li>
            <li>I do think I am going to really like the product.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so much smoother.</li>
            <li>this is not the case anymore thanks to InstaNatural.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m HOOKED on there whole line of products</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like the product but will be throwing it in the trash.</li>
            <li>I found this to be very hydrating and my acne scars seem to fade away.</li>
            <li>Absolutely recommend this for all skin types.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and packaged well.  </li>
            <li>used for 2 weeks straight.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s working very well.</li>
            <li>It works beautifully I really like this company that makes these products.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This is VERY moisturizing and works well.</li>
            <li>Gives me a sense of satisfaction and confidence knowing what I put on to my face is free of harmful chemicals that will potentially damage my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product isn’t tested on animals either, which I like very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I always apply the 30 day rule so that you can really see the differences in your skin.</li>
            <li>I always apply the 30 day rule so that you can really see the differences in your skin.</li>
            <li>It does give me very moist and plump like velvet skin and no acne for acne prone type skin like mine.</li>
            <li>This seems to really moisturize my face well.  </li>
            <li>and I suspect it was because they really pumped and slathered it on -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 50 year old women that has tried a zillion face creams without much success.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also been using it on my body, very versatile!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>It has even helped reduce much of the oily appearance I would get in the evening and for that I am really astounded and impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have to say it really stood up to Insta Naturals products.  </li>
            <li>This product was fantastic and I could see a different in my skin after just using it for a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is defying age, but it does work very well to moisturize and prevent dryness.  </li>
            <li>I really like this moisturizer</li>
            <li>This is a very affordable product which works well.</li>
            <li>InstaNatural Facial Moisterizer is a light almost whipped consistency.  </li>
            <li>Everything was in surface but my skin didn&#x27;t seem hydrated or comfortable but only greasy.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>Thanks again..</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It lasts much longer that way.  </li>
            <li>I have combination skin and my T-zone is very oily.</li>
            <li>Absorbs into skin very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this one.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t absorbing into my skin.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and the results I am now seeing.</li>
            <li>I really like that this moisturizer is versatile.  </li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t believe how fast this stuff works.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very moisturizing to my hands and cuticles.</li>
            <li>I would have been happy with status quo!&lt;br /&gt;Admittedly the first 1-2 weeks I had a few minor break outs.  </li>
            <li>So much for that brand.</li>
            <li>and I thought I put on too much.</li>
            <li>Targets my wrinkles from doing the duck face so much</li>
            <li>Is showing real results.</li>
            <li>On my skin it not only softened but, hydrated hand wrinkles creating a smooth non greasy look.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing however does make me break out on my t zone, so I just avoid that area.</li>
            <li>I really like it .</li>
            <li>, it really helps with evening out</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I really like instanatural products</li>
            <li>Age-Defying Moisturizer is very moisturizing together with the serum.  </li>
            <li>moisturizer has a very grassy or herbal fragrance, which can bother some people.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use this on my face because it&#x27;s too much for my face but</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>It provides the much needed hydration to skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, as much as I try, I can not get over the smell.</li>
            <li>I am really liking this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I also really, really like the scent and lets face it</li>
            <li>and I really need a moisturizer that works.</li>
            <li>I really like this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and I have really come to like it.</li>
            <li>leaves my skin glowing and very moisturized</li>
            <li>Smell- has a very &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Absorbs fast.  </li>
            <li>and absolutely does not leave a greasy or oily</li>
            <li>/&gt;While this might work really well for some people, it just isn&#x27;t for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, reading moisturizer would help.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!!&lt;br /&gt;Makes my skin so soft and younger looking! !</li>
            <li>I love the natural ingredients and do think that it is hydrating and brightening my skin at the same time.</li>
            <li>It is definitely up there on my list of favorite brands for natural beauty products.</li>
            <li>He likes the feel of the cream on his skin and the subtle but pleasant</li>
            <li>It will be more firm, smoother and fresh looking or radiant if you prefer that word.</li>
            <li>It will be more firm, smoother and fresh looking or radiant if you prefer that word.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, while it moisturizers amazingly, it&#x27;s not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>It works quickly to eliminate wrinkles, fine lines, crow’s feet, dark circles, and bags.</li>
            <li>organic aloe, organic sunflower oil, avocado oil, green tea, rose hip oil -- you name it,</li>
            <li>In the winter, I wouldn&#x27;t mind this product having the AHA in it as much, since more time is spent in doors for us.</li>
            <li>This bottle is large enough and contains enough moisturizer that you can easily use it on your face, neck, shoulders, chest and hands and not feel like you are draining your supply super fast.</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty minimal, and goes on easy, soaks in fast, and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li>moisturizer is safe for all skin types so you don&#x27;t have to worry about getting Normal, Dry or Oily.</li>
            <li>I recently developed Bells Palsy on the right side of my face, although, it did nothing to my skin persay, it did send my stress levels through the roof.</li>
            <li>I have looked for the right products for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see it much different than other creams, but it was a good price at the time.</li>
            <li>product is 98% natural its a really rich cream and makes the skin ultra soft.</li>
            <li>Face feels really hydrated all day long and the fine lines on my neck seems to be lighter</li>
            <li>downside of this product and perhaps it&#x27;s because of the way I used it, is that my face would get a bit dry minutes after applying (maybe it absorbed too quickly idk)</li>
            <li>just okay, but needs to wear sunblock because it made my skin darker due to the hyaluronic acid content.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin shiny or greasy like so many other products.  </li>
            <li>I have other products that work phenomenally on my face that I have opted to stick with instead.  </li>
            <li>when three younger ladies in one of our sister offices thought I was 40, I knew I had it going on (smile)!</li>
            <li>As to improved appearance that is permanent, I don&#x27;t expect much more than other brands that claim miracles.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great way to condition and improve my skin tone with very little effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is very good quality (which is a big deal) and not full of chemicals (even bigger deal to me)!  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34;10 years off my face!&amp;#34; dramatic, I&#x27;m happy with that.  </li>
            <li>This works GREAT on the parts of my face that get really dry, but it works a little too well on the oily parts too.</li>
            <li>Thanks for high quality.</li>
            <li>and I had to reapply to my face pretty frequently.</li>
            <li>so my sleep levels were much lower than normal and my stress levels were way up</li>
            <li>I can see her skin look more smoother, winkles and dark spots become lighter.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Remember it took awhile for your skin to get loose, wrinkles and fine lines, so please give this product time to work before you stop using.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Remember it took awhile for your skin to get loose, wrinkles and fine lines, so please give this product time to work before you stop using.</li>
            <li>Skin stays smooth and hydrated all day long!</li>
            <li>As I have gotten older (darn it) I have gotten choosier about the products I put on my face.  </li>
            <li>I have two main problems with this product:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to receive this to review on my blog</li>
            <li>/&gt;We are getting older.</li>
            <li>This product in particular, I have combo skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;Truly hydrates older skin.</li>
            <li>It goes on white like zinc oxide, but rubs in quickly.  </li>
            <li>Not so much for my face because it&#x27;s probably the most emollient moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used, and I don&#x27;t like the feel of anything heavy on my face, particularly during the summer when the humidity is high.  </li>
            <li>The pump is very sensitive to the touch, so you&#x27;ll never get too much product squirted out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Anyway, overall, it feels greasy, thick and heavy at first, BUT do not despair, in about 2 minutes it absorbes perfectly into your skin and feels clean, moisturized and never greasy, perfect base for make up.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels very soft!</li>
            <li>i had really high hopes because im still under 30 with visible lines on my face..</li>
            <li>but I still have high hopes that it will help with the wrinkles,</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this emollient moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend .</li>
            <li>Having said that I didn&#x27;t have high expectations in that regard</li>
            <li>All around I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li>In fact I would highly recommend the use of both together to achieve maximum benefit.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This lotion does not feel heavy when you put it on and the scent is very light.</li>
            <li>I just wanted to change things up a bit, so I researched the highly rated anti-wrinkle moisturizers on Amazon and chose this for the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>This is a high quality moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Right now just feel my face not dry.</li>
            <li>It has become my new favorite daily moisturizer and replaced my prior cream that I was using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I have been trying to switch over once I run out of my other skincare products to ones that are more natural and/or organic.</li>
            <li>The scent is stronger than other serums and facial products I&#x27;ve tried but still, it smells nice.</li>
            <li>but I need a little more.</li>
            <li>Unscented does not mean odorless.  </li>
            <li>After using it the first couple of times, I had a major breakout.</li>
            <li>I think it should be have a little more moisturizer in it specially for dry ski people like me too lite.</li>
            <li>So far I really like how it makes the skin on my face look and feel.</li>
            <li>and I really like how it makes my face feel soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>Because I really don&#x27;t *want* to look like a 20 year old anymore.  </li>
            <li>As far as the circles and puffiness of my eyes, I cannot tell whether it is really working to reduce that yet.</li>
            <li>It is thick and has great coverage and sinks into your skin fast.</li>
            <li>It’s a nice hand moisturizer and not the least bit greasy.</li>
            <li>I have noticed it starts working after one application, you dont normally need to put it on over and over.</li>
            <li>I have tried a few products from this company and have been pleased with all of them.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to be able to pass judgement on the abilities of the anti-aging components, but will update my review after I have been using this for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li>It is good for two years in the bottle, they do not test on animals and they even offer a 100% money back guarantee if you are not satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not this time though, the InstaNatural Anti-Aging Facial Moisturizer Cream is truly a product worth</li>
            <li>Everything that gets absorbed into my skin has a possible effect on him.</li>
            <li>Useful for the entire face.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer is a nice thick cream that comes out of a pump.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is very creamy, but absorbs fast and sinks right into my skin.</li>
            <li>Don’t get me wrong, I’ve tried heavier products that I love, but I prefer those that are lightweight and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually soft and smooth instead of dry.</li>
            <li>, you&#x27;re right, I&#x27;m a fisherman and we tend to embellish our stories a tiny</li>
            <li>have had the chance to try out quite a few of inst naturals products and I have loved every single one.</li>
            <li>I had questions and was surprised when they called me back and were very willing and helpful.  </li>
            <li>After only 2 weeks of using this product, the fine lines around my mouth and forehead have totally disappeared!  </li>
            <li>Other than that this product was fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Other products from this company are fantastic and I hope to find another moisturizer to use during the day.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m new with this</li>
            <li>Like with any new product you try it does take time.</li>
            <li>New product for me....will see.</li>
            <li>It is a thick, rich formula that absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li>Since I started law school my eye bags have been so dark it looks like I got hit in the face and the increased stress has caused some fine lines to appear on my face.</li>
            <li>Also, the pump protects the active ingredients from light and oxidation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve mainly been using on on my chest area which has some sun damage spots I want to clear up.</li>
            <li>Natural Youth Express Age Defying Moisturizer has Botanical Hyaluronic acid, Vitamin C, Vitamin B5, MSM, Cocoa Butter, Green Tea, Aloe Vera, Coconut oil, Jojoba oil, Sunflower oil, Rosehip oil, Flaxseed oil, Avocado oil, Lemongrass, Evening Primrose and more nutrients working together to give you the maximum benefits to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this Product also the only thing is you have to be Careful about going in the Sun while using this</li>
            <li>Even after I have worn  it for  a while, my skin still feels very soft.</li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive skin and have had breakouts all my life.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>This product works well for her very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The pump is easy to use and it doesn&#x27;t make a mess.</li>
            <li>It can be used on top of other specific target-area serums and eye creams to help lock in moisture.  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>yes”!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the first things I notice about skin care products (especially those that can be used on the face) is the smell.  </li>
            <li>My hands appeared younger looking after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note of caution, while this moisturizer is hydrating and provides all day moisture for your face, neck and decollete, sun exposure while using this product will cause dryness and clog pores.</li>
            <li>I usually choose something with an SPF 20 or more.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft, and keeps my skin feeling hydrated!</li>
            <li>and she thought I was too young for menopause!  </li>
            <li>Tightens my skin &amp;amp; it feels so soft!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure whether improved my skin after more than a month</li>
            <li>Why because they make their items with natural stuff!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using InstaNatural Anti-Aging for a couple weeks now and so far I like it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time you use it, you&#x27;ll have to pump the lid several times to get the lotion going.</li>
            <li>After 3 days of putting this on my hands at night they were soft again!</li>
            <li>While pregnant with my son, my sixth pregnancy, my skin became very dry and even flaky.  </li>
            <li>And as I get older and my skin loses more moisture</li>
            <li>the past several weeks fine lines and wrinkles have gradually but distinctly diminished.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, and since the company offers a money back guarantee, you have absolutely nothing to</li>
            <li>and it is mess free.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product for me to use because my hair stylist said my hair was a little dry the last time I went to see her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I only need a small amount for my whole face which I think is nice because it would take a while before I finish the entire bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it can cause birth defects if it is present in large quantities in the blood stream.</li>
            <li>I have an oily skin type and it is hard to find moisturizers that won&#x27;t make my skin be more oily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this product once so far, so I cannot say much.  </li>
            <li>They are not dramatic (yet), but a noticeable difference is evident by the test subject and some impartial observers also.</li>
            <li>far as the anti-aging, I really cannot comment on that, I am only 25</li>
            <li>I am in my late 40s, and received many compliments that I look like I am in my early 30s.</li>
            <li>My skin feels hydrated, soft, protected.</li>
            <li>Put it on after my routine face wash and it leave my face soft all day.</li>
            <li>I can say that I will be using this product again because it can be used on my body and is gentle enough for my face.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every natural skin product you can name.</li>
            <li>This helped with my skin tone and brought out the soft part of my skin.  </li>
            <li>98% of this product is made with natural organic ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but so far I couldn&#x27;t be happier</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT is soft</li>
            <li>It leaves the skin soft and non-greasy.  </li>
            <li>so it is too early to tell if it holds up to its claims.</li>
            <li>That’s why, when I was offered the opportunity to try the Insta Natural Youth Express Age-Defying Moisturizer, I didn’t hesitate to say “</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll keep my skin soft and moist , No oil.</li>
            <li>My skin feels hydrated and soft after I use</li>
            <li>May be its too early.</li>
            <li>&amp; I think you will be pleasantly surprised...........</li>
            <li>I like this product for the fact that it is 98% natural.</li>
            <li>was causing some irritation bumps, but my skin tends to be mildly sensitive to alpha hydroxy products.</li>
            <li>Insta Natural Youth</li>
            <li>I feel their ingredients are natural</li>
            <li>I have seen some improvement in my skin tone and my skin is soft.</li>
            <li>I also like that natural, affordable and it gives noticeable results.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn when placing it directly under my lower eyelid.  </li>
            <li>I have somewhat sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Insta Natural Age</li>
            <li>After 2 weeks of using this moisturizer my skin feels soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>and it’s sensitive</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin also and this does not irritate it.</li>
            <li>There is a lot of natural ingredients in this product.</li>
            <li>My skin is looking like the natural glow.</li>
            <li>It just smells natural.</li>
            <li>She gives it a glowing recommendation and loves that because it is natural and for all skin types she can recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>It is a well developed formula with the anti aging ingrediants I look for.</li>
            <li>I received Insta Natural&#x27;s Youth Express Age Defying Moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>, I think my skin looks firmer&amp;#34; I was really surprised.  </li>
            <li>Makes skin feel soft and plump.</li>
            <li>I disagree completely.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too early to tell, but I do like this product.</li>
            <li>but it depends on how much of the product I have actually used.  </li>
            <li>for the soft skin there&#x27;s the cocoa and shea butter.</li>
            <li>Completely odor-free</li>
            <li>it leaves my skin feeling soft and velvety.</li>
            <li>I like that it is all natural and leaves my skin naturally soft and not greasy.</li>
            <li>The Youth Express moisturizer is 98% all natural.</li>
            <li>But it being 98% all natural, I&#x27;m not too concerned.</li>
            <li>can appreciate that this product is 98% natural</li>
            <li>I like this product because of the natural ingredient list.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually sensitive to things with AHA</li>
            <li>I have 40 year old skin that is prone to break outs</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it is natural and contains no parabens, sulfates and alcohol.</li>
            <li>This products works well for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel really soft and not oily.</li>
            <li>Natural</li>
            <li>This cream does not irritate my sensitive skin, even used morning and night.  </li>
            <li>I have bought two bottles so far.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;InstaNatural uses all or almost all natural ingredients and you can tell the difference.  </li>
            <li>Their products either have no scent or rely on the natural ingredients for fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Maybe that is because I have sensitive skin, but that alone will keep me from using this again on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought for my mom in 70 years old.</li>
            <li>My hands and legs feel soft and not sticky.</li>
            <li>Overall I really like this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>but I checked the ingredients and there is no fragrance added so it&#x27;s just the natural smell of the ingredients which I can deal with.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate or aggravate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product in early November...and find that I need to reorder now.  </li>
            <li>My skin is hydrated, soft and supple, and just radiant from within.</li>
            <li>Within a few days of using instanatural my face began to feel more moist and I got my glow back!</li>
            <li>Okay product, though a bit too thick for me.</li>
            <li>It is thick and effective enough to be used as an under eye cream</li>
            <li>InstaNatural&#x27;s Youth Express Age-Defying Moisturizer reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles and other signs of aging as well as moisturizes your skin from deeply within.</li>
            <li>This is a rich cream and seems to almost &amp;#34;fill in the little wrinkles&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>After a hot shower, my face just seems to dry out, by the end of my day</li>
            <li>My hands can become pretty dry</li>
            <li>the problems on my face, it does work well as a moisturizer on my elbows and knees, which both tend to get pretty dry.</li>
            <li>I have been getting less breakouts, my skin tone appears to be more evened out, radiant and glowing - for the first time in years I can leave the house without any foundation on and not feel embarrassed by red spots and dark circles under my eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A bonus of this product is that I use less than I did when using the more expensive name brands - and I get better results.</li>
            <li>I wear it almost everyday after I clean my face.</li>
            <li>I have used several high end moiturizers over the years, and by doing some research just found Insta Natural.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have also been using 4 other products (InstaNatural) in my routine daily (morn &amp; night) for few days longer and highly recommend ALL Of THEIR PRODUCTS based on how fast I have noticed such amazing results by using only their products (morn n night)</li>
            <li>This product is a first for me as I&#x27;ve seem improvement with very limited breakouts.  </li>
            <li>It is very non-irritating to my sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li>It is simple to apply which I normally do once in the morning and once before the bed.</li>
            <li>It is simple to apply which I normally do once in the morning and once before bed.</li>
            <li>am truly loving this product, and I am using it on a daily basis, and have nothing negative to say about it!</li>
            <li>suffer from dry skin, and I live in a part of the country where during half of the year it is very old, and the other half is very warm.</li>
            <li>I really like it &amp; highly recommend it to anyone who needs a boost with dry facial skin..  </li>
            <li>The cream is a little heavier than I like but does absorb quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad smell but a very strong flowery smell that gave me a bad headache.</li>
            <li>I am no exception, to combat the breakouts, I treat with instanatural&#x27;s vitamin c toner, which contains witch hazel and dries my face out a little bit, (which I expect with all toners) combining the toner with this moisturizer has left my complexion blemish free with no drying after effects.</li>
            <li>I have only  been using the product for a couple of weeks and my skin did have to get used to a new face care regimen.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Susan Schenck, award-winning author of The Live Food Factor: The Comprehensive Guide to the Ultimate Diet for Body, Mind, Spirit &amp; Planet&lt;br /&gt;and&lt;</li>
            <li>A young man&#x27;s mistake, as I felt the excruciating pain of $60 fingernails in my forearm, reminding me that I&#x27;m not single or young.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My only dislike about the product is that it felt a little greasy when first putting it on, but whatever it was did wonders to my skin!!</li>
            <li>It keeps my dry skin very moisturized.</li>
            <li>so it really helps the dry patches I have on my face.</li>
            <li>The scent is faint to none, It is not irritating and after on use my skin was softer and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>Only reason I gave it five stars it because I haven&#x27;t had enough time to really give it a thorough review.</li>
            <li>It has a thick consistency, but it is absorbed fast by the skin, do not leaving residues.</li>
            <li>I use this in conjunction with the retinol serum and surprisingly, the small acne that were on my face dried out and disappeared within two days !</li>
            <li>It is creamy in nature but absorbs quickly and doesn’t feel heavy on my face.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer absorbs quickly and never feels greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li>The pump allows for just the right amount to come out so there is little to no waste.</li>
            <li>: As I have mentioned in my first review, I noticed this cream is very heavy, but absorbs very well.</li>
            <li>Maybe my skin is a little unique (I do have combination skin) but this moisturizer unfortunately left a sticky residue on my face.  </li>
            <li>No other compensation has been given.</li>
            <li>No other form of compensation was received.</li>
            <li>This is major.</li>
            <li>the list is long and you will be getting so much more with this cream that with others that only have a few things in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This facial anti-aging moisturizer is pretty instant to apply, but takes a month to finally see the difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this product for few days but it has already shown lots of improvement in the clear, clean, soft, and natural younger glowing face that was not so long ago affected by stress induced adult acne and clogged pores.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is light weight, but hydrates, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a strong a smell, and definitely not unpleasant, but it does linger for about 30-45 minutes after application.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel soft and appears to last all day</li>
            <li>The products that I have reviewed so far from Instanatural are among the easiest to open and use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have stated before, I have really dry skin and one of my main concerns</li>
            <li>I have stated before, I have really dry skin and one of my main concerns</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using Insta Natural Age</li>
            <li>I only use at night, as I have sensitive, acne-prone skin.  </li>
            <li>When I open the product and feel  it on my finger, it seemed to be soft and agreeable.</li>
            <li>Will continue to buy this product in the near future.</li>
            <li>So far I have only used this on my face</li>
            <li>only use once a day for sensitive skin, but doesn&#x27;t irritate</li>
            <li>and I was all for it, as a woman in my early 30’s I have starting to notice the aging progressing.</li>
            <li>You apply it all over the face and neck , now if you have sensitive skin it advises in the directions to only use at night.</li>
            <li>As far as the entire face, it makes my face itch.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick and my foundation didn&#x27;t go on as smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Nevertheless, it does have a heavy feel and takes a while to be absorbed by the skin.  </li>
            <li>It smells a little like grass initially but the smell fades quickly.</li>
            <li>The Anti Aging Moisturizer Cream does a good job at hydrating dry skin very well but leaves a heavy oily feeling behind in my case.</li>
            <li>definitely recommend this moisturizer to anyone who prefers using the most natural products possible on their delicate skin!</li>
            <li>However, this facial moisturizer by InstaNatural made the dry spots go away and really lighten the redness.</li>
            <li>Since it feels super thick (and I&#x27;m oily, sensitive and prone to breakout)</li>
            <li>I am old enough to need a wrinkle remover but also old enough to know that no cream can erase deep wrinkles,  but I can still hope.</li>
            <li>and I had high hopes it would hydrate it, but I would wake up with my skin very dry.</li>
            <li>I have the most sensitive skin on the planet and believed I would need to buy the other expensive cream my whole life, but I gave this a try</li>
            <li>last, I finally tried to put the InstaNatural Retinol serum  2,5%serum with 20% Vitamin C, 10% Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin E &amp; Powerfum Sik Firming Antioxidant Blend for face, Eyes &amp; Sensitive Skinwith IntaNaturak Youth Express Age Defying.</li>
            <li>it helps not only hydrate but puts firmness back into perspective of a natural healthier looking skin.</li>
            <li>Not dry or greasy.</li>
            <li>The smell is a little funky upon first application.  </li>
            <li>Only I notice the faint pink spots now as one normally notice his/her own imperfections.</li>
            <li>This facial cream is very rich with ingredients that nourish and rejuvenate my exhausted skin.</li>
            <li>and the results seem to last much longer than other products on the market that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>consistency is a bit thicker than other facial moisturizers I have used but absorbs really well</li>
            <li>and my face feels soft all day long.  </li>
            <li>It also lasts for a long time I could feel my skin soft over six hours after application.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older my skin has gone from mixed to quite dry, and this facial moisturizer just ends the flaking and itching, just stops it dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I live in AZ - a very dry, desert climate</li>
            <li>I needed to try a new moisturizer, I had tried several brands from the store and my face was still dry and itchy.</li>
            <li>very watered down.</li>
            <li>In fact, it&#x27;s actually a bit heavy of a moisturizer for me right now - my skin is still rather oily in places, especially in the summer.  </li>
            <li>I received a sample of this product to evaluate at little or no cost, I was under no obligation to post a review or give positive feedback.</li>
            <li>It is much thicker than the moisturizer I typically use, was concerned about breaking out, but did not have a problem.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Comes in a pump bottle, and less than a pea size drop will cover your whole face.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive and dry skin.  </li>
            <li>The first few ingredients listed on the package are organic and several herbal ingredients are listed as well.</li>
            <li>My main interest in this product was the claim that it was helpful for dark circles.</li>
            <li>I have very dry, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s creamy and easy to apply, a little half pump is all I need for neck and face so this will last a long time.  </li>
            <li>The lotion is very thick, it feels creamy and smooth and not greasy.</li>
            <li>I have little to no trouble spots on my face that I would consider needing fixed, with continued use of this and plenty of SPF</li>
            <li>A little drop is enough for the whole face for this skin type.</li>

            <li> I am really loving the InstaNatural brand!</li>
            <li> Great quality for a good price</li>
            <li> I love their products and excellent customer service provided to me.</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer, glad I decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I just love it</li>
            <li> The price for this is just the best with all the science and care they have put into this cream it should cost more.</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that you get a good amount of product and the price is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> InstaNatural really packed this moisturizer with the very best of the best ingredients.</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant.</li>
            <li> Unscented means that they did not add a pleasant smell, so you get whatever the components smell like.  </li>
            <li> , when something on you face has a scent, you want it to be a pleasant one.  </li>
            <li> also pleased with the scent, as it has an herbal/tropical-like scent that is very pleasant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for morning application under make-up, though because it contains an alpha hydroxy acid, it is strongly advised to use sunscreen while using this moisturizer in summer time (alpha hydroxy acid increases skin sensitivity to sun and may cause sunburns).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and within a couple weeks you will see a difference!</li>
            <li> My face is bright and glowing.</li>
            <li> On the bright side, I guess I can use it as a hand mosturizer.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are a good quality</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> , feels good.  </li>
            <li> No irritation at all, moisturizes well and feels good on the skin.</li>
            <li> and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li> She had family and friends tell me my skin looks good.  </li>
            <li> If it is good.</li>
            <li> Good to travel with too.</li>
            <li> Really good moisteruzer.</li>
            <li> Loved.</li>
            <li> This does not smell good at all. .</li>
            <li> I loved the neat packaging, the pump of the bottle makes it easier to use and does not cause any wastage.</li>
            <li> no smell is too much good</li>
            <li> I know my hands look and feel good.</li>
            <li> And the price is really good.</li>
            <li> I have found that the face moisturizers are just as good as the eye ones, so why buy both?</li>
            <li> Great to use for non greasy and effective skin care.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried (and loved)</li>
            <li> and I know how to pronounce them which is always a good thing.</li>
            <li> Keep up the good work.</li>
            <li> To be fair, I started the review at 3-Stars, so as to be neutral.</li>
            <li> so I need to get a good regimen going while using this</li>
            <li> because in my use, it has gone on smooth but best of all, no greasy after feel.  </li>
            <li> They offer a guarantee so that is a good thing.</li>
            <li> but I think this is a good moisturizer</li>
            <li> and I do think that it does a good job of keeping skin soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It contains a lot of good ingredients</li>
            <li> /&gt;Straight talk, this is one of three Instanatural products I&#x27;ve been using and they are all good.</li>
            <li> But the good thing about this product is that you can wear it underneath your makeup and makes your face feel refreshed.</li>
            <li> and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li> Good product at a good price.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful, light weight moisturizer.</li>
            <li> 3 plus ounces at a good price rather than one ounce for a fortune.</li>
            <li> Also good for knees/elbows.</li>
            <li> I loved my serums from them and maybe this is the way it&#x27;s supposed to work, but I did not like the greasy after feeling</li>
            <li> I try to take good care of my Face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;i loved it)&lt;br</li>
            <li> really good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> when you use hyaluronic acid products, you should follow with a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Good Value for your money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good after-shower body lotion and</li>
            <li> It works in good and I intend to continue using it.  </li>
            <li> I think the reason is that it is not water based, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin nice and smooth!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice texture and nice results.</li>
            <li> Creams need to have exceptional ingredients and need to have them in good quantities.</li>
            <li> Defying Moisturizer is a great product which absorbs very quickly and works great to keep my skin moisturized and hydrated.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful to have a face cream that doesn&#x27;t smell full of perfumes and dyes.</li>
            <li> I love how my face was very nice and pleasant after I used this and</li>
            <li> This moisturizer contains a remarkable combination of many of the best as well as time-proven ingredients available for improving and maintaining healthy, beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> It also  has a nice pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Also, the company is generous to their customers, and they have an exceptional customer service to boot.</li>
            <li> it absorbs into the skin quickly and performs superbly.</li>
            <li> This is another great product from InstaNatural that I love.  </li>
            <li> my skin look every day most beauty i am happy</li>
            <li> I found myself using this product more as part of my bedtime routine because after washing and removing my makeup at the end of the day, I felt my face needed some &amp;#34;nourishment&amp;#34; and this works great.</li>
            <li> One of those things is truly finding great skincare that matches the healthy foods we feed our bodies.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> read the reviews beforehand about the breakouts many experienced with the product</li>

            <li> Moisturizer feels nice.</li>
            <li> feels nice on the skin.  </li>
            <li> but I have been noticing a nice difference in my skin tone and texture.  </li>
            <li> my own based on my experience with the product.</li>
            <li> All opinions are my own</li>
            <li> /&gt;Received in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice when applied, and then I don&#x27;t notice it after it has been applied.  </li>
            <li> They use good ingredients, and I feel safe using their products.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my mom and she is loving it.</li>
            <li> Smells nice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is kind of earthy/herbal.</li>
            <li> Smells kind of like vitamins</li>
            <li> It also leaves a nice glow on your skin.</li>
            <li> Absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li> Would be nice if it had some sun protection in it.</li>
            <li> I used this for about a month and generally liked it</li>
            <li> It is nice product.</li>
            <li> The dispenser is handy, allowing you to dispense the amount you want.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer works into the skin nicely without leaving residue on the hands.</li>
            <li> but my opinions are my own</li>
            <li> more things to make you feel good about when using this product.</li>
            <li> but this product has been really nice.</li>
            <li> I guess the best way would to say that it smells very &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and takes some time to get used to.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was thicker than I anticipated but went into the skin nicely.  </li>
            <li> All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> the scent is nice.  </li>
            <li> I put one pump of this in the palm of my hand, then add 2-3 squirts of InstaNatural&#x27;s Rose Hip Oil, mix it together and apply.  </li>
            <li> has well, coupled with the Rose Hip Oil at night before bed.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin nice and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> and I honestly cannot be happier with them.</li>
            <li> This is a decent moisturizer, but not the best one for me.</li>
            <li> But I think this moisturizer will be perfect in winter when my skin is drier, and also if I just put it on the drier areas of my face, particularly around the eye area.  </li>
            <li> This is packed full of nutrient rich ingredients that are especially good and nourishing for your skin.</li>

            <li> Feels good on my face and seems to be taking away fine lines around my eyes.</li>

            <li> Surprised &amp; impressed!</li>
            <li> She liked it more than I did.  </li>
            <li> but this product keeps my face PERFECTLY moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li> Would like to see more products on sale or a nice BOGO once in a while....</li>
            <li> The bottle is a nice pump and I am able to control the amount I put out.  </li>

            <li> And this one is by far the best!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best moisturizer I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> I am impressed with the plethora of natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> and so what I can quite honestly say, is that they sell tippy top of the line skin care products and that I like them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells really good and so smooth on my face.</li>
            <li> has delivered more amazing results than any high-end department cream.</li>
            <li> and he liked the smell of it, so perhaps this is even better for the men out there who need to moisturize.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a nice product, but I got a lovely case of contact dermatitis when I used it.</li>
            <li> Love this company and their amazing products.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t love the smell but it feels nice on my face.</li>

            <li> Very moisturizing and smells good!</li>
            <li> The serums are the best products this company offers versus these moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Spend your money on the C serum, the Hyd. Acid serum, and the Retinol serum --- I swear by these top notch products.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>

            <li> I love the scent, and I use it on my hands at night as well as my face.</li>
            <li> The smell is not my favorite</li>
            <li> Love the 2 together.</li>
            <li> My skin appeared more luminous, and who couldn’t use a bit more luminosity in their day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love the smell and it soaks in - not leaving my skin greasy</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about most of you</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I have hurt my fingers trying to get something to come out of bottles, cans, etc.</li>
            <li> and this is really awesome news for me because now I can finally use all the product up before it expires!</li>
            <li> It is also safe to use around the eyes and I have been doing that without any problems.</li>
            <li> I just used this cream for two more days.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say more about it.</li>
            <li> Will write more after I use 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> If we except that truth we can focus on making it much better.</li>
            <li> but I like radiant, healthy, and glowing skin.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t get any breakouts while using this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I like that my skin looks more hydrated and healthier.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love how it makes my skin look.</li>
            <li> I notice that my skin appears more moist &amp; healthy--younger, I would say.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> one most exercise caution.</li>
            <li> This is soooo smooth on the skin!</li>
            <li> I was pleased when I received the chance to review this product for my blog.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> so I made sure to Not do that.</li>
            <li> I used a pea size amount  (not even) on my face( one pea sized amount for the lower part of my face and another for the top part)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also using the eye gel, which I love.</li>

            <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Defying Moisturizer Cream is an okay cream but will not solve all of your problems.</li>
            <li> I say that if you are having no age difficulties at this time (meaning that if you do not have any problems then this will be okay for you).</li>
            <li> It does not seem to be a magic cream.</li>
            <li> I love the pump top.  </li>
            <li> You are sure to find what you are looking for here.  </li>
            <li> Their prices are great and you will really get a lot for your money.  </li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s ok.  </li>

            <li> Love this cream.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product now for more than 7 days.</li>
            <li> Will buy more...</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t see it&#x27;s a magical power to reduce wrinkles.</li>
            <li> My wife has also enjoyed using this moisturizer in her repertoire of face creams.</li>
            <li> also love that my mineral powder foundation sticks to my skin so much better after applying this moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I am so glad I recieved this product for review.</li>

            <li> I have written a more detailed review on my blog thebeautyanalytic.blogspot.com</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really go for moisturizers that are scented, but my mom thought it smelled good.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt hydrated but it does sink into your skin nicely leaving no feeling stickiness like a heavier moisterizer can and because of that I have been using this in the morning after my shower then applying my foundation over it after its absorbed</li>
            <li> She is in her 50&#x27;s and need a good anti aging moisturizer that is gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> It works good on fine lines, and it has many effective ingredients to fight the aging process and renew the skin such as hyaluronic and lactic acids, glycolic acid, and Vitamin C.</li>
            <li> This is a facial moisturizer that has a weight and thickness some were between a good hand cream and a good night cream, However it absorbs very well which makes it nice to wear morning and</li>
            <li> All in all, a good product, that did indeed provide some new life to my skin!</li>
            <li> This is great, makes my skin so smooth and soft after a day in the sun.</li>
            <li> so it is a very mild smell.</li>
            <li> I love that it is made with great nutrients such as Vitamin C and B5,  Cocoa  Butter, Aloe Vera, and Rosehip Oil.  </li>
            <li> it absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to any women who has an oily face and break out easily from makeup.</li>
            <li> so it is a very mild smell.</li>
            <li> Just like the cellulite cream, it has a dispenser which is easy to control</li>
            <li> But since I have fair skin that burns easily, using a product that makes my skin more sensitive does not work well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> product, with another Email asking if I was pleased with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I was not only buying a great product, but also felt that it matter to them whether the product was working or not for</li>

            <li> This product has organic ingredients, it is not tested on animals, and is made in USA.dont forget to apply sunscreen before going outside, and enjoy the great benefits of this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I can tell a huge difference in just using these products for 1week.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and really does a nice job of moisturizing.</li>
            <li> and this is a huge amount of product for price.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>

            <li> It has a nice smell and it seems to really impart moisture into my dry/oily/complicated skin.</li>
            <li> and my skin feels fabulous.</li>
            <li> I was given this product free for me to review</li>
            <li> I like that it is light weight</li>
            <li> This is such a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Could be great if only they put SPF in it.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li> but as I am only using at night it works great.</li>
            <li> and so one pump is really all I need which is nice.</li>
            <li> This really fit the bill.</li>
            <li> One star is for its promotional price and nice packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product may have promising ingredients</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and not greasy.</li>

            <li> This facial moisturizer is really great.  </li>
            <li> It goes onto the skin silky &amp; smoothly.  </li>
            <li> However, as I am getting to an age where moisturizers are important I decided to try this one.</li>
            <li> I was open-minded about this product, and endeavored to do an impartial, 4 week test.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so very soothing - the ingredients are great as individual ingredients, but all together are that many times better.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Obtained From: Manufacturer&lt;br /&gt;Payment: Free</li>
            <li> I would suggest giving about 15-20 min to make sure that the moisturizer has fully absorbed into skin before putting makeup on over it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also gluten free.  </li>
            <li> Cream last all day and feels great.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for several months now and it is great.  </li>
            <li> Moisturizes nicely but doesn&#x27;t make a real difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I got the chance to try out this fantastic Age Defying Moisturizer</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin like me it is best to only use most moisturizers at night.  </li>
            <li> My wife uses the product every morning after her showers and says it is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel smooth and free of oil.</li>

            <li> It makes my hair silky smooth</li>

            <li> /&gt;I was sent a free sample in order to make an informed review</li>
            <li> Works great for smaller area&#x27;s at a time to see the difference.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a generous 3.4 oz of cream for your money, and you don&#x27;t need to apply a lot to get the bene fit.  </li>
            <li> so it is important to protect  your skin with a sunscreen when using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worth every penny and their customer service is top notch.</li>
            <li> I  received it for free</li>
            <li> However I have not used it in warm weather yet, and that is often the real test.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this everyday for b 3 weeks, now and am quite impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> This facial moisturizer is great.</li>
            <li> I wanted a light moisturizer cream</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer in combination with InstaNatural&#x27;s Vitamin C Toner and their Vitamin C Serum with 20% Hyaluronic Acid Serum and really enjoy using all 3 products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This moisturizer contains cocoa butter and smells lightly of cocoa.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I really enjoy it at night or on my hands.</li>
            <li> This lotion goes on smooth &amp;</li>
            <li> but I did want a good moisturizer with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> have fair sensitive skin with a bit of rosacea on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I really like the Age-Defying Moisturizer so far, it feels very rich and soothing to my skin and makes the skin around my eyes feel great and &amp;#34;relaxed&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, I didn’t notice any significant changes in fine lines or wrinkles, which is another reason that I’ll opt not to use this on my face.  </li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this product as a tryout since I love InstaNatural Age Defining Serum so much.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the InstaNatural brand and can&#x27;t wait to try out some more of their products!</li>
            <li> It is not a bad moisturizer but it has a strong smell.  </li>
            <li> but really like it!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried several brands and I love this moisturizer!!</li>
            <li> Very powerful anti-wrinkle cream.</li>
            <li> It feels very light and not thick like most body lotions.</li>
            <li> so I was happy to take advantage of a special price and try their Anti-Aging Facial Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I am not disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;Their main list of ingredients are MSM, rose hip oil, vitamin c, cocoa butter, johoba oil, and hyaluronic</li>
            <li> The InstaNatural Age-Defying Moisturizer has an herbal scent, but it&#x27;s not too strong and fades quickly.</li>
            <li> It has a strong scent, but not unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a significant improvement in my skin in a number of ways.</li>
            <li> Rich texture.</li>
            <li> A lightweight, non-greasy, but rich and hydrating moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It is creamy and rich, without being at all greasy.</li>
            <li> First off, the product arrived on time, which pleased me.  </li>
            <li> Works better than high end brand name moisturizers for a fraction of the price!!</li>
            <li> I apply the serum first then this cream on top.</li>
            <li> The bottle is already a generous size, so it&#x27;s well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I am ALWAYS on the search for a great moisturizer that really performs well, and most of the time I am left dissappointed.</li>
            <li> It is rich and creamy, but not greasy.  </li>
            <li> so I was concerned about using a rich product</li>
            <li> After my first application, I did notice that my skin felt more hydrated.</li>
            <li> Now, I have a complete set of this line that I am very pleased with.</li>
            <li> But even more important and incredible is that the red, blotchy areas on my cheeks and forehead have faded until they are barely noticeable!  </li>
            <li> The good news, though, is that it is long-lasting and once absorbed, leaves my skin feeling soft and silky-smooth.  </li>
            <li> Like most of the products in their product line, this one contains lots of natural and organic ingredients; many of which you would recognize.  </li>
            <li> Jojoba oil which I have found is great for more dried patches of the skin.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin very moisture and smooth love</li>
            <li> I apply at night on clean skin before bed.</li>
            <li> It seems to absorb quickly and leaves my skin smooth and firm/tight.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week, but so far I have to say that it is one of the best moisturizers I&#x27;ve used in a while.</li>
            <li> My face has never been so smooth and vibrant!!!</li>
            <li> Bouth this with serum , and makes my skin pure then befoure , love this</li>
            <li> This product is right up my alley!  </li>
            <li> Face was very dry, used the moisturizer and skin feels great.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell very good and felt heavy on my skin.</li>
            <li> While I could see mild improvement at 2 weeks, it took 4 weeks to see significant results.</li>
            <li> , it’s rich and creamy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Good cream with light odor, not irritating for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> After my wife started using the Insta Natural Youth Express Age-Defying Moisturizer, she said her skin felt amazing.</li>
            <li> This product does an amazing job of keeping my skin soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> My complexion was left looking bright and radiant, with a smoother feel.</li>
            <li> I have tried several products from Instanatural and I have loved all of them.</li>
            <li> leave face soft and nice (no oily feeling)</li>
            <li> so I can finally feel good about what I putting on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have been loving my Insta Natural Products.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it is life-changing, but the pump is convenient and the size will last you a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> Keeps it nice and soft and plump.  </li>
            <li> it is good, after use it for a week, i can feel different than before.</li>
            <li> I really have enjoyed the cream.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of different moisturizers and am always on the alert for something good that won&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> The texture is phenomenal so it doesn&#x27;t take much per application</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> and I love that this product was both gentle and didn&#x27;t cause any problems for me.  </li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and this cream reacted nicely to it.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the low price and good reviews.</li>
            <li> The list of ingredients takes up the entire length of the bottle, but it&#x27;s good, &amp;#34;98% natural&amp;#34; stuff:</li>
            <li> I use this one on top of my serum and it works really well and dose not pill.</li>
            <li> You can read my full review on my blog by clicking the link below  [...]</li>
            <li> I do not use a full pump of the product as that seems to be a lot of product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a shame because it us one of the top products I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> Many products either irritate my skin, or leave it very oily.  </li>
            <li> Overall a good cream</li>
            <li> It lasted a full 4 months.  </li>
            <li> Not a bad price point tho.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not a bad cream..</li>
            <li> What I love about it is that it makes my face look and feel very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> So right away I knew it was a product I would be comfortable using.  </li>
            <li> It absorbed quickly and leaves your skin very fresh and moist.</li>
            <li> Really like this cream, it goes on my face very clean.</li>
            <li> This is a rich but easily absorbed and non greasy moisturizer in a convenient pump container.</li>
            <li> It is a light cream that easily soaks into your skin, and leaves your face feeling so soft, smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li> but it quickly soaked in once I rubbed it in all the way</li>
            <li> One thing I look for in a product is how quick does it work</li>
            <li> It has a nice texture and the smell is nice and it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling or heavy feeling on your face.  </li>
            <li> cannot possibly say enough wonderful things about their products, and this age-defying moisturizer is no exception!</li>
            <li> I have tried several anti-aging facial moistutizers and this is one of the best.  </li>
            <li> apply InstaNatural Mositurizer after washing with mild cleanser and applying Vitamin C Serum.  </li>
            <li> (I have a mild case of rosacea).</li>
            <li> I love this product, it makes my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> it goes away fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> Super moisturizing and absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li> but it quickly soaked in once I rubbed it in all the way</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I love this product and would definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> and it soaks in quickly with no after-burn.</li>
            <li> This product absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t make me shiny.</li>
            <li> Blends and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> Women should know how quickly makeup / beauty products should betossed.</li>
            <li> The natural, effective, non-abrasive ingredients make it worth trying.  </li>
            <li> Overall my skin looks more even and feels somewhat better compared to just a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> They absorb quickly with no sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> applying it on the body, this absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li> Super moisturizer, my husband loves it</li>
            <li> Anyway, like I said, product is beautifully packaged until you pump a little and prepare yourself to gag with its odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it is possible that the oils kind of accumulate, but right after using exfoliator, I was fine again...    </li>
            <li> Considering the fact that the thickness of the product is what likely locks in the moisture and results in the long-lasting effects, I would say that is accurate, making it worthwhile to keep this product around, as it does what it is advertised to do, which is a HUGE factor for me when it comes to reviewing products.kness of the product is what likely locks in the moisture and results in the long-lasting effects, I would say that is accurate, making it worthwhile to keep this product around, as it does what it is advertised to do, which is a HUGE factor for me when it comes to reviewing products.</li>
            <li> Put it on in the morning after a hot shower and it just dissolves into my skin, leaving it feeling smooth and firmer.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes my skin beautifully without feeling heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> and it is not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I started seeing some fine lines around my eyes and wrinkling that I wasn&#x27;t happy about, and this product along with other InstaNatural creams have really turned things around for my face.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s Great other than that!</li>
            <li> While this was a little heavy for my taste to use as a facial moisturizer, I am more than happy to give it 5 stars because it is an EXCELLENT eye makeup remover!</li>
            <li> I love my new face cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my new favorite and have reordered.</li>
            <li> I really love this new product line from InstaNaturals.</li>
            <li> I received an email checking in on my happiness with the products I purchased, and when I expressed my experience with this one they took the time to not only suggest another that might be a better fit, but to actually send me a complimentary bottle of it to try.</li>
            <li> I previously bought their vitamin C cream and had great results.  </li>
            <li> It rubs in easily and I don&#x27;t have to use too much.</li>
            <li> This product is absorbed quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li> Most of the ingredients look very natural without a lot of chemicals.  </li>
            <li> This is very natural in the products and healthy to the skin.</li>
            <li> Now, I want to say that just because a cream has the right ingredients does not mean that it will be a magic cream and solve all of your problems.</li>
            <li> you so much!!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Love everything from this company so far!</li>
            <li> You’ll notice the difference after the first use!</li>
            <li> and I finally found one I love!  </li>
            <li> BUT I am loving the results enough to live with it. :)</li>
            <li> It is gentle to the skin and reduced the appearance of fine lines and age spots.</li>
            <li> experienced no breakouts whatsoever and did see a difference - a little lightening of hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> Go get some of this and thank you instanatural for such an amazing customer service.</li>
            <li> Feels great, not too heavy or greasy for daytime use, but does the job.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this anti- aging moisturizer for about a month now and my skin absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> It is very lightweight and comes in a HUGE bottle.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite things about this product is that it is 98% natural and contains NO parabens, sulfates or alcohol.  </li>
            <li> Terrific, effective ingredients;</li>
            <li> The cucumber and aloe give a fresh sensation as well.</li>
            <li> I love that the ingredients are natural and do not irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> Have to admit that it was a bit pricey but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed that my skin is more sensitive in the sun.</li>
            <li> Well, I guess I will be paying more attention to my natural ingredients from now</li>
            <li> moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also been using it on the top of my hands because they are getting that old look to them</li>
            <li> moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also been using it on the top of my hands because they are getting that old look to them</li>
            <li> and it smells citrusy and fresh.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind using scented facial products, then this is a nice moisturizer to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> nice moisturizer overall</li>
            <li> /&gt;As noted on the container, this product will make your skin more sensitive to sunlight, so</li>
            <li> use about a dime&#x27;s size worth of cream on my face and neck after applying some vitamin C serum, and after 12 hours I can still feel the difference on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not expecting the bags to go away completely, but I&#x27;m happy to see they aren&#x27;t as obvious as they used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice facial moisturizer that exceeded my expectation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disclaimer: I was provided a complimentary sample.</li>
            <li> I have some smile lines around my mouth &amp; they are still there.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used many skincare products on my skin since I stopped having acne in my early 20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shopping around and trying out the most natural skin care possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I read the ingredients I see many natural foods and vitamins</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t evaluate them properly because I&#x27;ve been trying them for weeks, but not just this one</li>
            <li> so I cannot comment on the long term benefits of it&#x27;s use, but I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> No harsh ingredients and safe.</li>
            <li> I love that InstaNaturals products are not tested on animals and this one is 98% natural.</li>
            <li> I love The items from Insta Natural.</li>
            <li> I am pleased thus far.</li>
            <li> I have use many creams and found this one moisturized better than I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to use more natural products for myself, but also since I&#x27;m still breast feeding my son.</li>
            <li> I understand, to withdraw the natural fragrance of a product you have to add some ingredients that are not&lt;br /&gt;so natural or good for you.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I use 5 drops per night on freshly washed face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, making this a great product and a fantastic buy for my budget:)</li>
            <li> The best thing about this cream (besides it&#x27;s awesome anti-aging ingredients) is that it comes in a pretty sizable bottle, so I don&#x27;t feel guilty using it every night not only on my face, but my neck, upper chest, and HANDS as well.  </li>
            <li> I got used to it pretty quickly, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Results are pretty quick.</li>
            <li> It also has a light, clean, natural scent.</li>
            <li> The seller got it to me right on time</li>
            <li> I was processing a return right now</li>
            <li> soaks right in.  </li>
            <li> It does kind of smell like butt for the first 30 second when you are putting it on, but that goes away.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s true that it doesn&#x27;t function as a proper moisturizer which I apply separately on top if needed.</li>
            <li> OK -- I&#x27;ve tried the whole jar and can say it is not as good as my old standard O&#x27;real Revtalift and Callogen (at night).</li>
            <li> I actually like the pump which dispenses the moisturizer because it is very easy to control.</li>
            <li> When I use it, my hair is completely tangle free and can be quickly combed through.</li>
            <li> This has a nice light smell to it, has a consistency that&#x27;s not too thin and not thick but a nice medium.</li>
            <li> sensitive skin, I am always hesitant to introduce a new product into my regimen, but this is 98% natural, and uses so many organic ingredients that I felt safe trying.  </li>
            <li> Honestly who really has the time to have separate creams for multiple uses.</li>
            <li> price is great, especially for the generous size, and I don&#x27;t see myself going back to drug store moisturizers anytime soon!</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a strong smell associated with this product as 98% of its ingredients are all natural, which is not a deterrent for use in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It has a strong scent of natural ingredients, which I like.</li>
            <li> It quickly absorbs and does the job very well.</li>
            <li> product ships quickly and is packaged really well .</li>
            <li> As far as a daily moisturizer I loved this.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling smooth and soft!</li>
            <li> It soaked right into my skin and just left it feeling softer and looking better.  </li>
            <li> The packaging is great, it has a pump which I love because pumps keep the product uncontaminated by regular skin bacteria, and it is quite big, too, so it will last for a while.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.  </li>
            <li> I like it very much, it keeps my skin moist all day</li>
            <li> soft and fine lines are disappearing.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer it is thick and soaks into your skin quickly and leaves it moist not greasy, bought two more, one for my mom and one for my sister.</li>
            <li> As a woman on the go I need quick, easy and simple.</li>
            <li> but this magic made the dark circles disappear and the fine lines to go away too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to thank Instanatural for sending me their products to try out and for their help in meeting young waitresses and for no longer needing to shave and for being able to sing the high notes once again and.........</li>
            <li> Especially perfect if your skin is dry or you live in a dry climate like I do.</li>
            <li> One day I looked down and realized how great my left hand looked compared to my right!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel it moisturizes in the amazing manner I expected.  </li>
            <li> I use this moisturizer during the day and it makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I really love this moisturizer, It seeps instantly into the skin</li>
            <li> I love that it is ant-aging!&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> First of all, it smells funky -</li>
            <li> I will be buying several more products from InstaNatural after having used this &amp; the Vitamin C serum for about 3 weeks now.</li>
            <li> A very practical gift!</li>
            <li> It is a thicker formula that seemed to not want to soak into my skin at first.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> Her skin is so much softer and looks fresh.  </li>
            <li> Love this facial moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I use it daily bases, mostly in the morning before I put on my sunblocks.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying the InstaNatural line</li>
            <li> Only downfall I have with it is that it could have a better smell to it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> The first result I noticed was around days</li>
            <li> 3-5 yhe dryness was just about disappearing, my skin was soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> If it does a great job of conquering my skin care concerns, however, that’s the least of my worries.  </li>
            <li> First open ,I did not like this product the smell,After one month used this product ,I am feeling ok.</li>
            <li> Like most women (especially us over 40)</li>
            <li> Pump top seems fragile and I fear breaking it.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Only been a couple of weeks, noticing a bit more firmness.</li>
            <li> It’s summertime and this product is exactly what I need</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer for about two weeks and really like it!  </li>
            <li> After only one week I was able to see an improvement in my forehead lines and creases.  </li>
            <li> Since this cream does not have any sunscreen, it would not be my first choice.</li>
            <li> Directions say to put a serum on first</li>
            <li> it makes my skin feel soft and supple and helps to promote a wrinkle free face.</li>
            <li> how much I love the company that I decided to try another product to see if I can claim the same results and benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is fragrance free and organic just as what&#x27;s described - it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> Love this facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer does not have same wonderful smell as Age Defining Serum and rather like their SPF30, which does not smell like usual SPF at all but does not make me want to apply it at night.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very possible that twice per day application may result in greater effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I apply to my face and neck, and especially on my forehead, where there are more wrinkles.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> This product is fragrance free but don&#x27;t let that put you off; it is because of all the natural ingredients in the formula.  </li>
            <li> I tried this for a while only to find more sneaky blackheads and whiteheads forming in places</li>
            <li> I am still working on my first bottle and I am hoping the wrinkles are fading.  </li>
            <li> I neglected my skin until after menopause when I became distressingly aware of how rapidly I had aged.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> At the pharmacy, I was talking to another woman in line about hot flashes</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the first week of using it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crucial what is LEFT OUT of the ingredients, as there are so many toxic ones in most moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I wake with soft, smooth skin.  </li>
            <li> So I would  like to know how I can give you back the product and benefit of your guarantee satisfied or money</li>
            <li> I love this facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My complexion has really improved!</li>
            <li> It is a thicker formula that seemed to not want to soak into my skin at first.</li>
            <li> I have has so many stress related issues it&#x27;s done a number on my skin.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling soft, and looking smooth.  </li>
            <li> I was willing to try anything.</li>
            <li> , the smell did surprise me at first.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product, but after several uses my skin started to break out all around my chin and my forehead.</li>
            <li> It has a lovely fragrance, which isn’t too overpowering for a facial moisturiser.  </li>
            <li> I was also pleased with the moisturizer cream and decided to use it in my daily routine.  </li>
            <li> I would have to say the results are up there with the higher priced brands.</li>
            <li> Nice and smooth moisturizing creme applied to my face, however the fragrance is not appealing to me.</li>
            <li> Unsure when this happened, but the only product I was able to use was what squirted out into the lid.</li>
            <li> Light and soft skin.  </li>
            <li> and I feel my skin is soft and smooth</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles, but I can see how the thickness of this cream helps the skin plump back up to help decrease the signs of those wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3 ;)</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and does not irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd InstaNatural product and as with the others I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> InstaNatural Anti-Aging Facial Moisturizer Cream has many ingredients that provides nutrients to the skin, Vitamin C, Hyaluronic Acid, Vit. B5, MSM etc.</li>
            <li> It is the same with many things that are &amp;#34;unscented.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several products from InstaNatural and love them all.</li>
            <li> I feel this moisturizer really does what it says it will!</li>
            <li> Skin is starting to look more youthful.  </li>
            <li> For a natural product, it had a cheap, dollar store lotion smell.  </li>
            <li> It is good for oily skin as well, because it won&#x27;t clog the pores and make the skin oily after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I had previously brought Insta Natural eye serum and gel and was completly happy with the purchase, so when my serum and moisturizer ran out, I knew I had to try this.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good for my dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It has a very pleasant fragrance that is not added artificially and it goes on light as air but really holds in the moisture.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky like other moisturizers I have used, and you don&#x27;t need a lot for it to be effective.</li>
            <li> I had the privilege to have tried the Insta Natural Youth Express Eye Gel recently (see review HERE) and the results where amazing.</li>
            <li> the difference in my skin is that it has a prettier soft, clean look</li>
            <li> I was even asked if I&#x27;d had a facial recently (no) because my skin looks so good.</li>
            <li> and I bought this product several weeks ago because I liked the natural ingredients and hoped they would nourish my skin.  </li>
            <li> l have been using it faithfully since it arrived,so far lm pleased with the early results..  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t have the greatest smell, very earthy scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll be trying the night cream to see if I can get more long lasting moisture from using the same amount and do a review after using it for a good amount of time</li>
            <li> This facial creme is light and effective providing a powerhouse of bioavailable ingredients that you will quickly see working after just a few uses of this formula.</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve ever had something where I really did notice the difference.</li>
            <li> I have pretty good eye site but the white writing on the light yellow back ground</li>
            <li> This product has a putrid odor and very sticky consistency that prevents me from rating it higher.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought &amp;#34;I&#x27;ll never get used to this&amp;#34; but I absolutely did after about 2 weeks...</li>
            <li> At first, the product smells very funky-</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s full with natural ingredients</li>
            <li> Love,love,love have noticed such a huge difference in my skin its not even funny.</li>
            <li> One pump from an easy pump bottle will cover the entire face and neck -</li>
            <li> You can wear this daily, it absorbs easily into the skin.  </li>
            <li> so I have also used it on the top of my hands in hopes to help with the unsightly dry appearance.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 is because it doesn&#x27;t have an spf, and I liven Colorado where that&#x27;s pretty important.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly &amp; leaves my skin softly moisturized.  </li>
            <li> so I need for things to be easy to open and not give me hassles when trying to use.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the slight rose odor, but works so well who cares.</li>
            <li> I dont think I would recommend this product for oily skin but dry skin for sure.</li>
            <li> I have seen some improvement, but no dramatic difference.</li>
            <li> so I think it will definitely last a good long time as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far, this amazing moisturizer has evened my skins texture and tone, and I&#x27;m sure is working in countless other ways that I cant see it am not privy to just yet.  </li>
            <li> only difference is that the high end moiturizers have a nice and soft fragrance,&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> but I certainly did not.</li>
            <li> but it certainly won&#x27;t make them worse.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has certainly helped my face and neck area.</li>
            <li> Many brown spots (from too much sun exposure), wrinkles, dry skin, and crepe like skin.</li>
            <li> There is a nice thick consistency to the moisturizer that coats the skin and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> It goes on a tiny bit greasy but gets absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer goes on very rich, which I like because I have dry skin.</li>
            <li> My hands tend to crack and become dry very easily these days, but this cream leaves them feeling very soft and</li>
            <li> have some fine lines on my face, and even after a short trial I am seeing improvement in my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I do not see any difference in my facial appearance yet, still have the fine lines and age spots.  </li>
            <li> it would make my skin sensitive to the sun, but so far its been fine.</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit of the product and I love that it is safe to use around your eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This rich cream is better suited for body applications, rather than the face, unless the facial skin is extremely dry.  </li>
            <li> Such a huge container-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Vitamin C in my facial products, especially natural products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thanks so much for providing a product for review on my blog.</li>
            <li> I use it on my forearms and I can really tell a&lt;br /&gt;difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this moisturizer, but I just can&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> IT smelled very chemical-ish.</li>
            <li> I much prefer the night cream over this.</li>
            <li> I do think I am going to really like the product.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so much smoother.</li>
            <li> this is not the case anymore thanks to InstaNatural.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m HOOKED on there whole line of products</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like the product but will be throwing it in the trash.</li>
            <li> I found this to be very hydrating and my acne scars seem to fade away.</li>
            <li> Absolutely recommend this for all skin types.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and packaged well.  </li>
            <li> used for 2 weeks straight.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s working very well.</li>
            <li> It works beautifully I really like this company that makes these products.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This is VERY moisturizing and works well.</li>
            <li> Gives me a sense of satisfaction and confidence knowing what I put on to my face is free of harmful chemicals that will potentially damage my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product isn’t tested on animals either, which I like very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I always apply the 30 day rule so that you can really see the differences in your skin.</li>
            <li> I always apply the 30 day rule so that you can really see the differences in your skin.</li>
            <li> It does give me very moist and plump like velvet skin and no acne for acne prone type skin like mine.</li>
            <li> This seems to really moisturize my face well.  </li>
            <li> and I suspect it was because they really pumped and slathered it on -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 50 year old women that has tried a zillion face creams without much success.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also been using it on my body, very versatile!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It has even helped reduce much of the oily appearance I would get in the evening and for that I am really astounded and impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have to say it really stood up to Insta Naturals products.  </li>
            <li> This product was fantastic and I could see a different in my skin after just using it for a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is defying age, but it does work very well to moisturize and prevent dryness.  </li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer</li>
            <li> This is a very affordable product which works well.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural Facial Moisterizer is a light almost whipped consistency.  </li>
            <li> Everything was in surface but my skin didn&#x27;t seem hydrated or comfortable but only greasy.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> Thanks again..</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> It lasts much longer that way.  </li>
            <li> I have combination skin and my T-zone is very oily.</li>
            <li> Absorbs into skin very well.</li>
            <li> I really like this one.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t absorbing into my skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and the results I am now seeing.</li>
            <li> I really like that this moisturizer is versatile.  </li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t believe how fast this stuff works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very moisturizing to my hands and cuticles.</li>
            <li> I would have been happy with status quo!&lt;br /&gt;Admittedly the first 1-2 weeks I had a few minor break outs.  </li>
            <li> So much for that brand.</li>
            <li> and I thought I put on too much.</li>
            <li> Targets my wrinkles from doing the duck face so much</li>
            <li> Is showing real results.</li>
            <li> On my skin it not only softened but, hydrated hand wrinkles creating a smooth non greasy look.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing however does make me break out on my t zone, so I just avoid that area.</li>
            <li> I really like it .</li>
            <li> , it really helps with evening out</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really like instanatural products</li>
            <li> Age-Defying Moisturizer is very moisturizing together with the serum.  </li>
            <li> moisturizer has a very grassy or herbal fragrance, which can bother some people.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this on my face because it&#x27;s too much for my face but</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> It provides the much needed hydration to skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, as much as I try, I can not get over the smell.</li>
            <li> I am really liking this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I also really, really like the scent and lets face it</li>
            <li> and I really need a moisturizer that works.</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> and I have really come to like it.</li>
            <li> leaves my skin glowing and very moisturized</li>
            <li> Smell- has a very &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Absorbs fast.  </li>
            <li> and absolutely does not leave a greasy or oily</li>
            <li> /&gt;While this might work really well for some people, it just isn&#x27;t for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, reading moisturizer would help.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!&lt;br /&gt;Makes my skin so soft and younger looking! !</li>
            <li> I love the natural ingredients and do think that it is hydrating and brightening my skin at the same time.</li>
            <li> It is definitely up there on my list of favorite brands for natural beauty products.</li>
            <li> He likes the feel of the cream on his skin and the subtle but pleasant</li>
            <li> It will be more firm, smoother and fresh looking or radiant if you prefer that word.</li>
            <li> It will be more firm, smoother and fresh looking or radiant if you prefer that word.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, while it moisturizers amazingly, it&#x27;s not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> It works quickly to eliminate wrinkles, fine lines, crow’s feet, dark circles, and bags.</li>
            <li> organic aloe, organic sunflower oil, avocado oil, green tea, rose hip oil -- you name it,</li>
            <li> In the winter, I wouldn&#x27;t mind this product having the AHA in it as much, since more time is spent in doors for us.</li>
            <li> This bottle is large enough and contains enough moisturizer that you can easily use it on your face, neck, shoulders, chest and hands and not feel like you are draining your supply super fast.</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty minimal, and goes on easy, soaks in fast, and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li> moisturizer is safe for all skin types so you don&#x27;t have to worry about getting Normal, Dry or Oily.</li>
            <li> I recently developed Bells Palsy on the right side of my face, although, it did nothing to my skin persay, it did send my stress levels through the roof.</li>
            <li> I have looked for the right products for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see it much different than other creams, but it was a good price at the time.</li>
            <li> product is 98% natural its a really rich cream and makes the skin ultra soft.</li>
            <li> Face feels really hydrated all day long and the fine lines on my neck seems to be lighter</li>
            <li> downside of this product and perhaps it&#x27;s because of the way I used it, is that my face would get a bit dry minutes after applying (maybe it absorbed too quickly idk)</li>
            <li> just okay, but needs to wear sunblock because it made my skin darker due to the hyaluronic acid content.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin shiny or greasy like so many other products.  </li>
            <li> I have other products that work phenomenally on my face that I have opted to stick with instead.  </li>
            <li> when three younger ladies in one of our sister offices thought I was 40, I knew I had it going on (smile)!</li>
            <li> As to improved appearance that is permanent, I don&#x27;t expect much more than other brands that claim miracles.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great way to condition and improve my skin tone with very little effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is very good quality (which is a big deal) and not full of chemicals (even bigger deal to me)!  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;10 years off my face!&amp;#34; dramatic, I&#x27;m happy with that.  </li>
            <li> This works GREAT on the parts of my face that get really dry, but it works a little too well on the oily parts too.</li>
            <li> Thanks for high quality.</li>
            <li> and I had to reapply to my face pretty frequently.</li>
            <li> so my sleep levels were much lower than normal and my stress levels were way up</li>
            <li> I can see her skin look more smoother, winkles and dark spots become lighter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Remember it took awhile for your skin to get loose, wrinkles and fine lines, so please give this product time to work before you stop using.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Remember it took awhile for your skin to get loose, wrinkles and fine lines, so please give this product time to work before you stop using.</li>
            <li> Skin stays smooth and hydrated all day long!</li>
            <li> As I have gotten older (darn it) I have gotten choosier about the products I put on my face.  </li>
            <li> I have two main problems with this product:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive this to review on my blog</li>
            <li> /&gt;We are getting older.</li>
            <li> This product in particular, I have combo skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;Truly hydrates older skin.</li>
            <li> It goes on white like zinc oxide, but rubs in quickly.  </li>
            <li> Not so much for my face because it&#x27;s probably the most emollient moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used, and I don&#x27;t like the feel of anything heavy on my face, particularly during the summer when the humidity is high.  </li>
            <li> The pump is very sensitive to the touch, so you&#x27;ll never get too much product squirted out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Anyway, overall, it feels greasy, thick and heavy at first, BUT do not despair, in about 2 minutes it absorbes perfectly into your skin and feels clean, moisturized and never greasy, perfect base for make up.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels very soft!</li>
            <li> i had really high hopes because im still under 30 with visible lines on my face..</li>
            <li> but I still have high hopes that it will help with the wrinkles,</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this emollient moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend .</li>
            <li> Having said that I didn&#x27;t have high expectations in that regard</li>
            <li> All around I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> In fact I would highly recommend the use of both together to achieve maximum benefit.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This lotion does not feel heavy when you put it on and the scent is very light.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to change things up a bit, so I researched the highly rated anti-wrinkle moisturizers on Amazon and chose this for the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> This is a high quality moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Right now just feel my face not dry.</li>
            <li> It has become my new favorite daily moisturizer and replaced my prior cream that I was using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I have been trying to switch over once I run out of my other skincare products to ones that are more natural and/or organic.</li>
            <li> The scent is stronger than other serums and facial products I&#x27;ve tried but still, it smells nice.</li>
            <li> but I need a little more.</li>
            <li> Unscented does not mean odorless.  </li>
            <li> After using it the first couple of times, I had a major breakout.</li>
            <li> I think it should be have a little more moisturizer in it specially for dry ski people like me too lite.</li>
            <li> So far I really like how it makes the skin on my face look and feel.</li>
            <li> and I really like how it makes my face feel soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> Because I really don&#x27;t *want* to look like a 20 year old anymore.  </li>
            <li> As far as the circles and puffiness of my eyes, I cannot tell whether it is really working to reduce that yet.</li>
            <li> It is thick and has great coverage and sinks into your skin fast.</li>
            <li> It’s a nice hand moisturizer and not the least bit greasy.</li>
            <li> I have noticed it starts working after one application, you dont normally need to put it on over and over.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few products from this company and have been pleased with all of them.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to be able to pass judgement on the abilities of the anti-aging components, but will update my review after I have been using this for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li> It is good for two years in the bottle, they do not test on animals and they even offer a 100% money back guarantee if you are not satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not this time though, the InstaNatural Anti-Aging Facial Moisturizer Cream is truly a product worth</li>
            <li> Everything that gets absorbed into my skin has a possible effect on him.</li>
            <li> Useful for the entire face.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer is a nice thick cream that comes out of a pump.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is very creamy, but absorbs fast and sinks right into my skin.</li>
            <li> Don’t get me wrong, I’ve tried heavier products that I love, but I prefer those that are lightweight and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually soft and smooth instead of dry.</li>
            <li> , you&#x27;re right, I&#x27;m a fisherman and we tend to embellish our stories a tiny</li>
            <li> have had the chance to try out quite a few of inst naturals products and I have loved every single one.</li>
            <li> I had questions and was surprised when they called me back and were very willing and helpful.  </li>
            <li> After only 2 weeks of using this product, the fine lines around my mouth and forehead have totally disappeared!  </li>
            <li> Other than that this product was fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Other products from this company are fantastic and I hope to find another moisturizer to use during the day.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m new with this</li>
            <li> Like with any new product you try it does take time.</li>
            <li> New product for me....will see.</li>
            <li> It is a thick, rich formula that absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li> Since I started law school my eye bags have been so dark it looks like I got hit in the face and the increased stress has caused some fine lines to appear on my face.</li>
            <li> Also, the pump protects the active ingredients from light and oxidation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve mainly been using on on my chest area which has some sun damage spots I want to clear up.</li>
            <li> Natural Youth Express Age Defying Moisturizer has Botanical Hyaluronic acid, Vitamin C, Vitamin B5, MSM, Cocoa Butter, Green Tea, Aloe Vera, Coconut oil, Jojoba oil, Sunflower oil, Rosehip oil, Flaxseed oil, Avocado oil, Lemongrass, Evening Primrose and more nutrients working together to give you the maximum benefits to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this Product also the only thing is you have to be Careful about going in the Sun while using this</li>
            <li> Even after I have worn  it for  a while, my skin still feels very soft.</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin and have had breakouts all my life.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> This product works well for her very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The pump is easy to use and it doesn&#x27;t make a mess.</li>
            <li> It can be used on top of other specific target-area serums and eye creams to help lock in moisture.  </li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> yes”!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the first things I notice about skin care products (especially those that can be used on the face) is the smell.  </li>
            <li> My hands appeared younger looking after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note of caution, while this moisturizer is hydrating and provides all day moisture for your face, neck and decollete, sun exposure while using this product will cause dryness and clog pores.</li>
            <li> I usually choose something with an SPF 20 or more.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft, and keeps my skin feeling hydrated!</li>
            <li> and she thought I was too young for menopause!  </li>
            <li> Tightens my skin &amp;amp; it feels so soft!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether improved my skin after more than a month</li>
            <li> Why because they make their items with natural stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using InstaNatural Anti-Aging for a couple weeks now and so far I like it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time you use it, you&#x27;ll have to pump the lid several times to get the lotion going.</li>
            <li> After 3 days of putting this on my hands at night they were soft again!</li>
            <li> While pregnant with my son, my sixth pregnancy, my skin became very dry and even flaky.  </li>
            <li> And as I get older and my skin loses more moisture</li>
            <li> the past several weeks fine lines and wrinkles have gradually but distinctly diminished.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, and since the company offers a money back guarantee, you have absolutely nothing to</li>
            <li> and it is mess free.  </li>
            <li> This is a good product for me to use because my hair stylist said my hair was a little dry the last time I went to see her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I only need a small amount for my whole face which I think is nice because it would take a while before I finish the entire bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it can cause birth defects if it is present in large quantities in the blood stream.</li>
            <li> I have an oily skin type and it is hard to find moisturizers that won&#x27;t make my skin be more oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product once so far, so I cannot say much.  </li>
            <li> They are not dramatic (yet), but a noticeable difference is evident by the test subject and some impartial observers also.</li>
            <li> far as the anti-aging, I really cannot comment on that, I am only 25</li>
            <li> I am in my late 40s, and received many compliments that I look like I am in my early 30s.</li>
            <li> My skin feels hydrated, soft, protected.</li>
            <li> Put it on after my routine face wash and it leave my face soft all day.</li>
            <li> I can say that I will be using this product again because it can be used on my body and is gentle enough for my face.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every natural skin product you can name.</li>
            <li> This helped with my skin tone and brought out the soft part of my skin.  </li>
            <li> 98% of this product is made with natural organic ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but so far I couldn&#x27;t be happier</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT is soft</li>
            <li> It leaves the skin soft and non-greasy.  </li>
            <li> so it is too early to tell if it holds up to its claims.</li>
            <li> That’s why, when I was offered the opportunity to try the Insta Natural Youth Express Age-Defying Moisturizer, I didn’t hesitate to say “</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll keep my skin soft and moist , No oil.</li>
            <li> My skin feels hydrated and soft after I use</li>
            <li> May be its too early.</li>
            <li> &amp; I think you will be pleasantly surprised...........</li>
            <li> I like this product for the fact that it is 98% natural.</li>
            <li> was causing some irritation bumps, but my skin tends to be mildly sensitive to alpha hydroxy products.</li>
            <li> Insta Natural Youth</li>
            <li> I feel their ingredients are natural</li>
            <li> I have seen some improvement in my skin tone and my skin is soft.</li>
            <li> I also like that natural, affordable and it gives noticeable results.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn when placing it directly under my lower eyelid.  </li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Insta Natural Age</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of using this moisturizer my skin feels soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> and it’s sensitive</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin also and this does not irritate it.</li>
            <li> There is a lot of natural ingredients in this product.</li>
            <li> My skin is looking like the natural glow.</li>
            <li> It just smells natural.</li>
            <li> She gives it a glowing recommendation and loves that because it is natural and for all skin types she can recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> It is a well developed formula with the anti aging ingrediants I look for.</li>
            <li> I received Insta Natural&#x27;s Youth Express Age Defying Moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> , I think my skin looks firmer&amp;#34; I was really surprised.  </li>
            <li> Makes skin feel soft and plump.</li>
            <li> I disagree completely.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too early to tell, but I do like this product.</li>
            <li> but it depends on how much of the product I have actually used.  </li>
            <li> for the soft skin there&#x27;s the cocoa and shea butter.</li>
            <li> Completely odor-free</li>
            <li> it leaves my skin feeling soft and velvety.</li>
            <li> I like that it is all natural and leaves my skin naturally soft and not greasy.</li>
            <li> The Youth Express moisturizer is 98% all natural.</li>
            <li> But it being 98% all natural, I&#x27;m not too concerned.</li>
            <li> can appreciate that this product is 98% natural</li>
            <li> I like this product because of the natural ingredient list.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually sensitive to things with AHA</li>
            <li> I have 40 year old skin that is prone to break outs</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is natural and contains no parabens, sulfates and alcohol.</li>
            <li> This products works well for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel really soft and not oily.</li>
            <li> Natural</li>
            <li> This cream does not irritate my sensitive skin, even used morning and night.  </li>
            <li> I have bought two bottles so far.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;InstaNatural uses all or almost all natural ingredients and you can tell the difference.  </li>
            <li> Their products either have no scent or rely on the natural ingredients for fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Maybe that is because I have sensitive skin, but that alone will keep me from using this again on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought for my mom in 70 years old.</li>
            <li> My hands and legs feel soft and not sticky.</li>
            <li> Overall I really like this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> but I checked the ingredients and there is no fragrance added so it&#x27;s just the natural smell of the ingredients which I can deal with.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate or aggravate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product in early November...and find that I need to reorder now.  </li>
            <li> My skin is hydrated, soft and supple, and just radiant from within.</li>
            <li> Within a few days of using instanatural my face began to feel more moist and I got my glow back!</li>
            <li> Okay product, though a bit too thick for me.</li>
            <li> It is thick and effective enough to be used as an under eye cream</li>
            <li> InstaNatural&#x27;s Youth Express Age-Defying Moisturizer reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles and other signs of aging as well as moisturizes your skin from deeply within.</li>
            <li> This is a rich cream and seems to almost &amp;#34;fill in the little wrinkles&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> After a hot shower, my face just seems to dry out, by the end of my day</li>
            <li> My hands can become pretty dry</li>
            <li> the problems on my face, it does work well as a moisturizer on my elbows and knees, which both tend to get pretty dry.</li>
            <li> I have been getting less breakouts, my skin tone appears to be more evened out, radiant and glowing - for the first time in years I can leave the house without any foundation on and not feel embarrassed by red spots and dark circles under my eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A bonus of this product is that I use less than I did when using the more expensive name brands - and I get better results.</li>
            <li> I wear it almost everyday after I clean my face.</li>
            <li> I have used several high end moiturizers over the years, and by doing some research just found Insta Natural.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have also been using 4 other products (InstaNatural) in my routine daily (morn &amp; night) for few days longer and highly recommend ALL Of THEIR PRODUCTS based on how fast I have noticed such amazing results by using only their products (morn n night)</li>
            <li> This product is a first for me as I&#x27;ve seem improvement with very limited breakouts.  </li>
            <li> It is very non-irritating to my sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li> It is simple to apply which I normally do once in the morning and once before the bed.</li>
            <li> It is simple to apply which I normally do once in the morning and once before bed.</li>
            <li> am truly loving this product, and I am using it on a daily basis, and have nothing negative to say about it!</li>
            <li> suffer from dry skin, and I live in a part of the country where during half of the year it is very old, and the other half is very warm.</li>
            <li> I really like it &amp; highly recommend it to anyone who needs a boost with dry facial skin..  </li>
            <li> The cream is a little heavier than I like but does absorb quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad smell but a very strong flowery smell that gave me a bad headache.</li>
            <li> I am no exception, to combat the breakouts, I treat with instanatural&#x27;s vitamin c toner, which contains witch hazel and dries my face out a little bit, (which I expect with all toners) combining the toner with this moisturizer has left my complexion blemish free with no drying after effects.</li>
            <li> I have only  been using the product for a couple of weeks and my skin did have to get used to a new face care regimen.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Susan Schenck, award-winning author of The Live Food Factor: The Comprehensive Guide to the Ultimate Diet for Body, Mind, Spirit &amp; Planet&lt;br /&gt;and&lt;</li>
            <li> A young man&#x27;s mistake, as I felt the excruciating pain of $60 fingernails in my forearm, reminding me that I&#x27;m not single or young.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only dislike about the product is that it felt a little greasy when first putting it on, but whatever it was did wonders to my skin!!</li>
            <li> It keeps my dry skin very moisturized.</li>
            <li> so it really helps the dry patches I have on my face.</li>
            <li> The scent is faint to none, It is not irritating and after on use my skin was softer and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> Only reason I gave it five stars it because I haven&#x27;t had enough time to really give it a thorough review.</li>
            <li> It has a thick consistency, but it is absorbed fast by the skin, do not leaving residues.</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with the retinol serum and surprisingly, the small acne that were on my face dried out and disappeared within two days !</li>
            <li> It is creamy in nature but absorbs quickly and doesn’t feel heavy on my face.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer absorbs quickly and never feels greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> The pump allows for just the right amount to come out so there is little to no waste.</li>
            <li> : As I have mentioned in my first review, I noticed this cream is very heavy, but absorbs very well.</li>
            <li> Maybe my skin is a little unique (I do have combination skin) but this moisturizer unfortunately left a sticky residue on my face.  </li>
            <li> No other compensation has been given.</li>
            <li> No other form of compensation was received.</li>
            <li> This is major.</li>
            <li> the list is long and you will be getting so much more with this cream that with others that only have a few things in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This facial anti-aging moisturizer is pretty instant to apply, but takes a month to finally see the difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for few days but it has already shown lots of improvement in the clear, clean, soft, and natural younger glowing face that was not so long ago affected by stress induced adult acne and clogged pores.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is light weight, but hydrates, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a strong a smell, and definitely not unpleasant, but it does linger for about 30-45 minutes after application.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel soft and appears to last all day</li>
            <li> The products that I have reviewed so far from Instanatural are among the easiest to open and use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have stated before, I have really dry skin and one of my main concerns</li>
            <li> I have stated before, I have really dry skin and one of my main concerns</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using Insta Natural Age</li>
            <li> I only use at night, as I have sensitive, acne-prone skin.  </li>
            <li> When I open the product and feel  it on my finger, it seemed to be soft and agreeable.</li>
            <li> Will continue to buy this product in the near future.</li>
            <li> So far I have only used this on my face</li>
            <li> only use once a day for sensitive skin, but doesn&#x27;t irritate</li>
            <li> and I was all for it, as a woman in my early 30’s I have starting to notice the aging progressing.</li>
            <li> You apply it all over the face and neck , now if you have sensitive skin it advises in the directions to only use at night.</li>
            <li> As far as the entire face, it makes my face itch.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and my foundation didn&#x27;t go on as smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Nevertheless, it does have a heavy feel and takes a while to be absorbed by the skin.  </li>
            <li> It smells a little like grass initially but the smell fades quickly.</li>
            <li> The Anti Aging Moisturizer Cream does a good job at hydrating dry skin very well but leaves a heavy oily feeling behind in my case.</li>
            <li> definitely recommend this moisturizer to anyone who prefers using the most natural products possible on their delicate skin!</li>
            <li> However, this facial moisturizer by InstaNatural made the dry spots go away and really lighten the redness.</li>
            <li> Since it feels super thick (and I&#x27;m oily, sensitive and prone to breakout)</li>
            <li> I am old enough to need a wrinkle remover but also old enough to know that no cream can erase deep wrinkles,  but I can still hope.</li>
            <li> and I had high hopes it would hydrate it, but I would wake up with my skin very dry.</li>
            <li> I have the most sensitive skin on the planet and believed I would need to buy the other expensive cream my whole life, but I gave this a try</li>
            <li> last, I finally tried to put the InstaNatural Retinol serum  2,5%serum with 20% Vitamin C, 10% Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin E &amp; Powerfum Sik Firming Antioxidant Blend for face, Eyes &amp; Sensitive Skinwith IntaNaturak Youth Express Age Defying.</li>
            <li> it helps not only hydrate but puts firmness back into perspective of a natural healthier looking skin.</li>
            <li> Not dry or greasy.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little funky upon first application.  </li>
            <li> Only I notice the faint pink spots now as one normally notice his/her own imperfections.</li>
            <li> This facial cream is very rich with ingredients that nourish and rejuvenate my exhausted skin.</li>
            <li> and the results seem to last much longer than other products on the market that I have tried.  </li>
            <li> consistency is a bit thicker than other facial moisturizers I have used but absorbs really well</li>
            <li> and my face feels soft all day long.  </li>
            <li> It also lasts for a long time I could feel my skin soft over six hours after application.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older my skin has gone from mixed to quite dry, and this facial moisturizer just ends the flaking and itching, just stops it dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I live in AZ - a very dry, desert climate</li>
            <li> I needed to try a new moisturizer, I had tried several brands from the store and my face was still dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> very watered down.</li>
            <li> In fact, it&#x27;s actually a bit heavy of a moisturizer for me right now - my skin is still rather oily in places, especially in the summer.  </li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product to evaluate at little or no cost, I was under no obligation to post a review or give positive feedback.</li>
            <li> It is much thicker than the moisturizer I typically use, was concerned about breaking out, but did not have a problem.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Comes in a pump bottle, and less than a pea size drop will cover your whole face.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive and dry skin.  </li>
            <li> The first few ingredients listed on the package are organic and several herbal ingredients are listed as well.</li>
            <li> My main interest in this product was the claim that it was helpful for dark circles.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s creamy and easy to apply, a little half pump is all I need for neck and face so this will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> The lotion is very thick, it feels creamy and smooth and not greasy.</li>
            <li> I have little to no trouble spots on my face that I would consider needing fixed, with continued use of this and plenty of SPF</li>
            <li> A little drop is enough for the whole face for this skin type.</li>
            <li> The scent is very subtle, not overpowering, and dissipates once it absorbs - and it absorbs quickly leaving my skin so soft.  </li>
            <li> Then as I massaged the product on my face slowly, the cream disappeared and got absorbed.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone with dry skin because it definitely wouldn&#x27;t take long to knock out the dry patches.&lt;br /&gt;*I was provided a sample for review</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone with dry skin because it definitely wouldn&#x27;t take long to knock out the dry patches.&lt;br /&gt;*I was provided a sample for review</li>
            <li> I use this product in combination with some of InstaNatural&#x27;s other products (Argan Oil, Rosehip Seed Oil, etc) and really like how their products complement each other for well-rounded skin and glow.  </li>
            <li> the pump to get just as much as you need, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> far  as the effect on my skin this moisturizer works even better than some very expensive</li>
            <li> highly recommend the use of  InstaNatural Youth Express Moisturizer as an everyday face, neck and hand cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using InstaNatural&#x27;s Anti-Aging Facial Moisturizer Cream for about three weeks now, and it&#x27;s made a big difference in eliminating dry skin around my eyes and forehead, as well as helping to ease irritation around my neck where I shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I looked less tired, and my skin just looked better.  </li>
            <li> This lotion seemed moisturizing enough, but the smell was quite off putting to me and I a not sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li> Not completely gone but enough to know it&#x27;s getting better&lt;</li>
            <li> however, the scent does not last long</li>
            <li> a teeny tiny bit goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> I bought it a second time and look forward to seeing continued and increased benefits from long term use.</li>
            <li> This cream felt way too thick and pasty when I put it on for the first time.</li>
            <li> Note that the cream smells like herbal medicine and by that I don&#x27;t mean floral herbs, I mean more like Chinese medicine which smells earthy/woody.</li>
            <li> I will do a proper review when I&#x27;ve used it for at least a month straight.  </li>
            <li> Love this cream and the cocoa buttery scent but the packaging is too bulky and inconvenient, give me a simple jar or tube any day please</li>
            <li> Since I have dry, red skin it worked well on my skin type.</li>
            <li> I absolutely DO NOT RECOMMEND is slathering this product on your face the same way you&#x27;d slather bbq sauce on some baby back</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the lotion has a really strong smell .</li>
            <li> I started by using my Clarisonic on the backs of my hands with a gentle cleanser and patting them dry and applying a small drop of this moisturizer to each hand while it was still moist.</li>
            <li> My skin is a little sensitive, so I generally just apply it at night, rather than twice per day like other users.</li>
            <li> After the first use, I noticed that it was a little greasy and my skin felt a little sticky.</li>
            <li> I recently turned 30 and have been starting to notice crows feet and other lines appearing where they hadn&#x27;t been before.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other under-eye products I&#x27;ve tried, this one is not only for under the eyes, but also for your entire skin.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is the mixture or one product in particular</li>
            <li> It goes on thick and has a slightly sticky texture but it absorbs into your skin fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> Contrary to a lot of reviews, I did like the smell and given the fact that it has all natural ingredients makes it very effective.&lt;br /&gt;Its been two weeks since I had used it, the cream is a bit thick and little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My skin is tight and dry but using this cream makes my face feel so refreshed and soft.</li>
            <li> I will be using this one for a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> bought my second bottle and its almost empty now..</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and hydrated all day without feeling heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> Strange smell but send to work as a fault moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I can see minor improvement - my skin looks and feels a bit softer and maybe a bit smoother.  </li>
            <li> But I think if I keep using this long term it will help me avoid some wrinkles and signs of aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> For a long time I have used Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair and had no complaints.</li>
            <li> Not intense, but present.</li>
            <li> I so far like the scent of this cream and the fact that it&#x27;s not greasy and heavy.  </li>
            <li> skin feels hydrated for a long time!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> You may just be happier inside your skin than you have been in a long time.</li>
            <li> This is somethng that I will be continuing to use for a long time.</li>
            <li> Leaves your face really oily, and worst of all the smell can be very overwhelming, I thought I could just get through the smell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many Insta Natural products and have yet to be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Skin looks plumper, smoother, and is a good base for your makeup.  </li>
            <li> They are very dry currently, and since I have been using this on my elbows they are not as dry.</li>
            <li> Seemed a little thick, but absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> It slaps wrinkles silly and goes after dry skin like a thousand tiny jackhammers tenderizing your flesh, then it gets absorbed and your face feels like your tummy does after the second trip to the salad bar.</li>
            <li> Half a pump is all I would use while applying to my face, and I was left feeling as if my skin needed to breathe (possibly leading to the breakouts).&lt;br /&gt;Aside from those criticisms, I will continue to use this product - just not on my face!</li>
            <li> Nothing dramatic or really too noticeable to anyone besides myself, but I definitely feel like it is helping to maintain the current condition of my skin and improve it</li>
            <li> While other reviewers have found this cream to be &amp;#34;easy to apply&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;light-feeling&amp;#34;, I have the opposite opinion.</li>
            <li> However, I will try some other products from the same company..or maybe give this moisturizer another chance.</li>
            <li> I purchased cream this along with several other anti-aging moisturizers to find one that suited me.</li>
            <li> However over past weeks of using it, it seems it has completely blocked my pores, in a very sneaky, slow, invisible manner.</li>
            <li> Even though I have not used it very long (about one week)</li>
            <li> I moisture lasts all day and I am not flakey and dry even on my arms.</li>
            <li> Helps a lot if you have wrinkles and dry skin.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t the dry flaky type of skin that it had been throughout the pregnancy.  </li>
            <li> My face is dry.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t even have any dry spots.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to people with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I shave every day and it leave my face dry and chaffy.</li>
            <li> It does dry my skin</li>
            <li> if you have skin that&#x27;s not so dry</li>
            <li> I have dry skin on my body</li>
            <li> ,dry  </li>
            <li> This moisturizer is already helping me with wrinkles and dry skin.</li>
            <li> and my skin no longer feels dry and</li>
            <li> Trying to find products to help me with my dry skin is something I am always doing.</li>
            <li> So if you have dry skin anywhere on your body, I would say don&#x27;t hesitate to try this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I tend to have dry skin on some parts of my face and this product does not leave my face oily.  </li>
            <li> My skin during winter gets soo dry</li>
            <li> My only issue is that it is a bit heavy following application.</li>
            <li> I had dry red spots caused by pregnancy hormones that I tried a few facial moisturizers on.</li>
            <li> What I have noticed is that even in the winter time, my skin feels soft and appears smoother unlike past winters.  </li>
            <li> It has a subtle scent, light and nutty, and fairly thick.</li>
            <li> and it has taken me years to nail down my facial product routine</li>
            <li> Too much, and it feels a little on the heavy side, but it hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts!</li>
            <li> Goes on kind of heavy and greasy and has an unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Lets face it, dry skin and makeup together do not go!</li>
            <li> The last under-eye product I tried was a gel that felt greasy and caused a slight burning sensation for about a minute.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about a week &amp; already my smaller wrinkles are less noticeable</li>
            <li> My skin is hydrated and less red than it was before I started using it.</li>
            <li> This cream is pretty thick and heavy; my skin always felt oily after application.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this for the anti-aging properties, but unfortunately I was never able to use it on my face long enough to find out how well it worked for that.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> , my skin is very dry and the moistrization level f</li>
            <li> skin is very dry</li>
            <li> In the winter, I have very dry skin, so I use a thicker moisturizer.</li>
            <li> skin is very dry, and this moisturizer makes my skin feel supple and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> People think I am in my late 20&#x27;s and never get guessed for anything over early 30&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> I spent slightly less overall (ounce per ounce) and the product is use for BOTH day and night.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> This moisturizer did the trick, people have remarked that I look  little younger.</li>
            <li> I use only a little on my face since you don&#x27;t need much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure</li>
            <li> It is a very thick cream but seems to absorb fast.</li>
            <li> I do have to say that I would recommend this to any other mom or just someone with dry skin issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But when I put on my face it was a little too thick and much too greasy.</li>
            <li> was nothing like i expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few days</li>
            <li> Insta naturals has a wide range of beauty products.  </li>
            <li> Somehow did make my skin look healthier, plumper, and cause absolutely no breakouts...</li>
            <li> but I would not hesitate to use it on any rough patches on my body.</li>
            <li> Only a few weeks</li>
            <li> You just need to be careful,</li>
            <li> but that is always to be expected whenever you change product.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Yes, I know I have to be careful with retinol during pregnancy</li>
            <li> it is not very fragrant.</li>
            <li> It removes dead skin cells and works to protect the skin providing moisture and nourishment to the skin creating a softer texture and ultimately clearer skin.</li>
            <li> I owe that partially to this product...</li>
            <li> The moisturizer is thick and has an aroma I can only describe as &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;plant-y.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s definitely not perfumed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it is a side effect of natural products not having fragrances and like all of the natural products the smell leaves</li>
            <li> but I hate the smell, to be honest.</li>
            <li> A little bit does go a long way as it does not have a thick or sticky consistency so you can easily apply a thin coat on both face and neck with one application</li>
            <li> I like my appearance, but wanted to find a product that would help me maintain my skin and face so that I continue to look my age, not older!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it was a little too rich for that purpose.</li>
            <li> have no complaints so far, except that there is not a suncreen (but that would mean unnatural ingredients).</li>
            <li> When I first got this product I was a little put off by the smell (reminded me of the health food store) and the consistency (very thick) but after reading the reviews I wanted to try it.  </li>
            <li> experience is not positive at all.</li>
            <li> Perhaps other batches smell different, but the cream I received smells of its&#x27; ingredients - simply a mixture of jojoba oil, cocoa butter and rosehip oil, and a subtle mix at that.</li>
            <li> Soft subtle skin .</li>
            <li> It is not greasy and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I just put some on and a little goes a long ways</li>
            <li> Also a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Trust me while experimenting with this and all their products a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I use it on my hands as well and find that skin on my hands is no more dry after the long winter.</li>
            <li> However, after using it for a week with no results, and even a few minor breakouts, I tossed it in the trash.</li>
            <li> It says on the bottle that it can be used on other areas</li>
            <li> other moisturizers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this lotion (along with their other products) is helping my skin stay balanced.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a month along with some other items by the company.</li>
            <li> Due to the fact that they don&#x27;t, I wont buy it again.</li>
            <li> have noticed other reviewers have noticed about the scent.</li>
            <li> BUT, like I said in my toner review, I have extremely oily skin</li>
            <li> Add in the desire to be paraben-free, and the search feels endless.</li>
            <li> It only takes a small amount and</li>
            <li> I cant wait to try their other product too.</li>
            <li> So, experiment with your moisturizer to see if it can help you in other areas as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, experiment with your moisturizer to see if it can help you in other areas as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have no bias one way or the other regarding this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the second week, I was pulled over and told that my parents would have to be notified, I gave him the number for Shady Hills and wished him luck with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve started using it every other day ever since I noticed a neighbor had his eye on me</li>
            <li> The two products have worked well together to reduce dark spots and rough patches on my forehead.  </li>
            <li> other ingredients</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll report long use of this product after a few month&#x27;suse.</li>
            <li> I will not use any other product.</li>
            <li> That, and other reviews I read, prompted me to try this product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or make my skin breakout as some other moisturizers have.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer evens out your skin tone by diminishing the presence of age spots, sunspots, scars, and other discoloration.</li>
            <li> A little goes a VERY long way.</li>
            <li> I was very careful to not apply it if I will be outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Left my face very greasy feeling and the next day after using, my face had begun breaking out.  :(</li>
            <li> Organic Aloe Vera, Cucumber Distillate, Botanical Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin C, Organic Sunflower Oil, Tamanu Oil, Organic Borage Oil, Organic Flax Seed Oil, Organic Evening Primrose Oil, Organic Rosehip Oil, Vitamin B5, Wildcrafted Arnica, Organic Lavender, Organic Calendula, Organic Chamomile, Macadamia Nut Oil, Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Glycolic Acid( to give a very slight peel with each application), Organic Coconut Oil, Squalane, Palm Oil, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Cocoa Butter, Organic Beeswax, Organic Jojoba Oil, Coenzyme Q10, Phytic Acid, Phospholipids, Grapeseed Oil, Wildcrafted Oregon Grape, Wildcrafted Green Tea, Camellia Oil, Avocado Oil, Wildcrafted Eyebright, Helichrysum Essential Oil, Organic Licorice, Lemongrass, Vitamin C Palmitate, Tocopheryl (Antioxidant), Pyrus Malus, Citrus Medica Lemon, and Sugar Cane.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not right for my skin.</li>
            <li> A noticed a slight burn due to the hyaluronic acid but over a week, smoother skin appearance.</li>
            <li> Whilst this product kept the area under my eyes moisturized, I did not see any improvements to the dark circles.</li>
            <li> But, it has had no effect for the dark circles.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product with the vitamin C serum and the eye cream for dark circles.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed a change in my dark spots or wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Seems like it brightens and reduces dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li> Not fun.</li>
            <li> So be careful, you don&#x27;t want to waste this stuff.</li>
            <li> I am in a remote overseas location and the environment is quite harsh</li>
            <li> This moisturizer feels luxurious when it goes on, it&#x27;s thick and creamy, but absorbs instantly</li>
            <li> texture is not too thick but definitely not too runny either.</li>
            <li> My skin feels and looks amazing even with our nasty winds  that normally dry my face out</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t let down:</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try other products from this Company!</li>
            <li> When I put this on my face (I combine it with the 100% Rosehip Seed Oil, my face feels extremely moisturized!</li>
            <li> ,  it seems to be helping to improve my skin tone and texture, my skin is hydrated in the morning, not that combination of dry and oily like it usually is.  </li>
            <li> It can almost be used on small areas of the body that are extremely dry.</li>
            <li> Due to the heavy weight of the cream, I prefer to use it on my body, but not my face.  </li>
            <li> Brown spots took a bit longer, about 2 weeks, to really start to fade, but that is probably because the skin on your hands is so different from your face, and these were some bad brown spots.</li>
            <li> My skin condition seems to have improved with continued use and I&#x27;ve become less susceptible to ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> Its ridiculous that they don&#x27;t have any products with SPF in it for daily use.  </li>
            <li> The treated side of his face seems firmer and less wrinkly than the untreated side.</li>
            <li> It has an odd smell</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s less than optimal</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finishing up the bottle on my legs since the skin there is less finicky than my face.</li>
            <li> less wrinkle.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer offers the moisture I need without irritating my skin and it isn&#x27;t heavy.</li>
            <li> I detect a slight smoothing of the wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve recently been trying to get serious about anti-aging skin care.  </li>
            <li> I alsonused this product as a moisturizer after I applied the eye serum under my eyes for black circles.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my neck, an area that I had previously neglected.  </li>
            <li> I can’t speak to the summer months of wearing it under makeup but, since you tend to wear less I would guess that you can.</li>
            <li> As time has gone by, the smell has bothered me less and less but is still noticeably there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already noticing results within less than a week.  </li>
            <li> My wrinkles are looking less noticeable.</li>
            <li> so I was not about to mess with it.</li>
            <li> Well, I have had a few sleep deprived months and dark circles is all I have.</li>
            <li> My face has never been through any rough spells until this past year.</li>
            <li> Luckily, however, I didn’t have a bad experience in that regard with this product.  </li>
            <li> Many Vitamin C lotions are loaded with unnecessary ingredients and preservative and the Vitamin C still is oxidized leaving a very sad product as the end result.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it - morning and night - for a little over a month.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer helps my face to be whiter and smoother, but I feel that a little helpful for Anti-Aging.</li>
            <li> but it smells a little like celery</li>
            <li> Don’t let this stop you if you spend little to no time out-of-doors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I know, it&#x27;s the little things in life that excite me nowadays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the smell--a little bit like a forest</li>
            <li> I soaks into the skin with little rubbing effort.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I leave it a little longer before applying makeup</li>
            <li> I was a little unsure about using this product.</li>
            <li> A little heavy for my face for a daytime moisturizer under makeup but works well for nighttime.</li>
            <li> but it felt a little heavy and caused me to break out.  </li>
            <li> Age Defying Moisturizer is a little greasy but nowhere as near as bad as some of its competitors.&lt;br /&gt;The big deal here is quality and quantity.  </li>
            <li> The problems started when l found painful bumps between my eyebrows and on my temples and huge hard pores on my chin.</li>
            <li> Please do just a few thing in this life for yourself,get this moisturizer, you will thank you yourself morning and night.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s calming, moisturizing but not to heavy.</li>
            <li> She bought this and the night cream and uses it everyday.  </li>
            <li> It also is a heavy lotion that made my face feel oily.</li>
            <li> I cant wait to see the end result with using this item for a few weeks</li>
            <li> IN FEW FEW DAY</li>
            <li> I have to go heavy with the cologne after using this.</li>
            <li> but a few days</li>
            <li> This product moisturizes well, not greasy or heavy.  </li>
            <li> It is neither lightweight and watery nor heavy and creamy.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t leave any heavy feeling when I put it on.</li>
            <li> It is heavy but not oil/greasy.</li>
            <li> my hands are always dried out and cracking.</li>
            <li> After a few days I stopped noticing the smell.</li>
            <li> (i have trouble with that)</li>
            <li> The Youth Express Moisturizer keeps my skin supple, firm, and hydrated all day.</li>
            <li> The ingredients list sold me: green tea, cocoa butter, cucumber and vitamins to name a few.</li>
            <li> The Argan Oil can be used as a conditioner every day or once every few days.</li>
            <li> Glides onto the skin like butter, and it provides visible results within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I will be passing this along to my mom since I have a few problems using it.    </li>
            <li> I used this on my hands in the winter when they were so cracked they they would bleed everyday.</li>
            <li> When looking at the ingredients there are still a few unpronounceable/unidentifiable ingredients in the product.</li>
            <li> I let it soak in for a few hours and then put moisturizer over it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a relatively heavy cream that is loaded with cocoa butter</li>
            <li> Yep...these pumps are really crappy make, as I have seen with other reviews...so bad, because I would have give 5 star for the moisturizer...but now, that it has been adulterated and had to be scooped into another old container, I feel weird...    </li>
            <li> I use it on my neck area daily and have noticed a dramatic difference in the color and smoothness of my neck.  </li>
            <li> So it turns out that after my initial disappointment in this as a face cream, I will repurchase it as a neck and decollete cream for as long as InstaNatural makes it, which I hope is forever.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t moisturize very well, and the smell was unpleasant to me.</li>
            <li> Since I seriously &amp;#34;heart&amp;#34; my other InstaNatural products, I bought this to use as a night cream on my face.  </li>
            <li> Does not work as well and is not a very effective moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to put on my face as my skin is very sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I also felt like it gave a little brightness to some of the dull parts of my skin.</li>
            <li> was even a little hard for me to read.  </li>
            <li> The only other disappointment I had with this is that it does not have any sunscreen or SPF protection in it and that is always a bonus for me that I try to look for in my moisturizers</li>
            <li> The texture and consistency might be a little thick</li>
            <li> There is very little odor at all</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not pleasant like other moisturizing</li>
            <li> I usually have issues with my oily skin</li>
            <li> Since I usually use the InstaNatural product which contains Retinol, I use this moisturizer either at night or on a non sunny day.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually like a sort of pump foam cream</li>
            <li> Not sure, it&#x27;s been 10 days since I am using</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this moisturizer is working or not.</li>
            <li> I have been using InstaNatural Youth Express Age Defying Moisturizerfollow for the past three weeks</li>
            <li> the course of the past 2 yrs.</li>
            <li> Not many, but some.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re face like some products I used in the past.</li>
            <li> Although it says no scent, to me it had this small scent that was not to my liking.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;effective&amp;#34; this anti-aging moisturizer is yet,but I&#x27;m having a hell of a time blending this thing on my face!!! :-/</li>
            <li> My skin has that glow that I&#x27;ve never had from any sort of moisturizer I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> Thick heavy cream.</li>
            <li> It is very thick and make my face a little shiny.</li>
            <li> My skin has been looking dull and this gave me the glow I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Very thick and heavy,</li>
            <li> but i can&#x27;t complain at least i am not allergic to anything in it.</li>
            <li> I like the way it makes my skin feel and try to use it at least once a day along with the Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li> This acid is commonly used as a filler/protectant in spas/salons.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Caucasian woman in my late fifties</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is 100 ml (3.4 OZ) in the container and after using it for over a month I still have plenty to go (I&#x27;d say at least 3/4 of it</li>
            <li> hydrated my delicate eye area</li>
            <li> This is a thick but not greasy moisturizing product.  </li>
            <li> This cream is excessively thick - it would be easier to smear cocoa butter on my face.</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that it is not all thick and leaving a thick film on my face after using.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m just doubtful of the ingredients being really on this product.</li>
            <li> Thick, but not greasy.  </li>
            <li> The bottle comes with a dispenser and the cream is thick and not watery which is always a plus.</li>
            <li> Goes on really thick</li>
            <li> Thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> Too thick for my face, I use it on my elbows and knees.</li>
            <li> prefer this moisturizer for winter because it&#x27;s so thick, but you could use it year-round.</li>
            <li> moisturizer is thick.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is too thick for my summer skin routine.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is creamy and thick, but not too thick.</li>
            <li> Also, you use very little wach time!</li>
            <li> #34;Item should be received by 3/23.&amp;#34; I mean today is 3/23 at 8PM.</li>
            <li> I mean, I like Neutrogena and Eucerin and Gold Bond</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to give such a bad review, but this heavy, smelly cream just doesn&#x27;t work!  </li>
            <li> It started off subtle but I complexly notice a change.</li>
            <li> , that is slightly unpleasant to me, but maybe that is a personal preference.</li>
            <li> My only complaint with it is it smells really bad.</li>
            <li> They are serious about wanting 100% satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Not only does a bad smell start to make me nauseous after a while</li>
            <li> It’s a heavy cream that is somewhat difficult to spread and goes on very thick.  </li>
            <li> ; smell which I have found very hard to get used to</li>
            <li> I have previously been afraid to use moisturizers because I thought they would break me out.</li>
            <li> My skin no longer feels tough</li>
            <li> My skin no longer feels tough</li>
            <li> It is very thick</li>
            <li> moisturizer is very thick and whipped in texture.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick.  </li>
            <li> It feels very thick too.  </li>
            <li> Since it is a thick moisturizer I use it at night because my makeup applied weird.</li>
            <li> But the result was worse,</li>
            <li> Since it is a thick moisturizer I use it at night because my makeup applied weird.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe anything that will produce a dramatic effect.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is a little earthy, but not as bad as others, and it is tolerable and after it&#x27;s applied, I don&#x27;t notice it a bit.  </li>
            <li> --it&#x27;s a very very subtle, faint scent of cucumber to</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed that there was no spf</li>
            <li> None of that icky, drying, damaging, bad for you</li>
            <li> im just so sad that it doesnt not work on me..</li>
            <li> I still use the eye gel I bought from this company, but this moisturizer unfortunately did not work.  </li>
            <li> Just silly.</li>
            <li> , it’s sometimes difficult to get rid of, even after attempting to wash it off.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately it won&#x27;t be a product I&#x27;d use again.</li>
            <li> I am sorry</li>
            <li> sorry but seen no changes</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they are very hard, painful and almost impossible to remove without damage...</li>
            <li> See, I have a skin that sometimes has outbreaks but not in the typical oily/teenager spots, but since I have started using this cream, the areas of no problems before have become breeding grounds for families of nasty, hardened pores.</li>
            <li> I was afraid that using during the summer months on my oily skin would be a problem</li>
            <li> Call me crazy</li>
            <li> It has an unpleasant odor.  </li>
            <li> 12/21/14  Very sad to report that now I have stopped using the cream alltogether.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t that bad</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if the item I got is just a bad batch or something.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sorry, it smells really bad.</li>
            <li> I have bad health spells from time to time where I don&#x27;t even think about using my skincare, so I have had products expire before I get them all used up</li>
            <li> This is not for me, I have tried it 2 times and it has made my face itch really bad</li>
            <li> Bad news for the buyers</li>
            <li> I have not had any bad skin reactions from this yet.</li>
            <li> Now I can go without makeup and people aren&#x27;t asking me if I am sick.</li>
            <li> this cream :(&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  </li>
            <li> But I was a bit disappointed in this one because it did not absorb itself into my skin.</li>
            <li> Particularly annoying is it creates whiteheads in the crease around my nose and around my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I always hate sticking my fingers in a jar.  </li>
            <li> (I really hate it when products pill) .</li>
            <li> I hate perfume.</li>
            <li> Horrible smell is a breaker for me.</li>
            <li> There’s nothing like rubbing a product all over your face that smells horrible.  </li>
            <li> but it smells terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is my go to moisturizer after exfoliating my face. It feels so amazing on my skin.</li>
            <li> Very nice moisturizer.  InstaNatural products are awesome. I use this moisturizer during the day and it makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I have tried several products from Instanatural and I have loved all of them. The ingredients are a good quality and I get great results.&lt;br /&gt;I have some fine lines on my face, and even after a short trial I am seeing improvement in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel moisturized and did not experience any side effects from using this cream. Such a huge container- I will be using this one for a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much for providing a product for review on my blog.</li>
            <li> Great texture.  Love the bottle and the fact that it dispenses the exact amount you need!</li>
            <li> just okay, but needs to wear sunblock because it made my skin darker due to the hyaluronic acid content.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer.  A little heavy for my face for a daytime moisturizer under makeup but works well for nighttime.</li>
            <li> I really love this moisturizer, It seeps instantly into the skin and I don&#x27;t feel like I am wearing anything at all, yet my skin feels smooth. I have some problems with age spots and I have noticed a visible difference in the spots fading.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product for a face moisturizer. I love that it is ant-aging!&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I love that this moisturizer contains an anti-aging agent in it!  It has a very pleasant smell and you can use it not only on your face but all over your body.  I used it specifically on my face to treat fine lines and wrinkles and also to keep my elbows and knees from drying out.  The cream goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky or greasy residue.  It keeps my skin hydrated throughout the day and my skin feels healthier just by using it on a daily basis.  I have had issues with eczema in the past and it doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate my hot spots at all.  One of my favorite things about this product is that it is 98% natural and contains NO parabens, sulfates or alcohol.  I highly recommend the InstaNatural brand and can&#x27;t wait to try out some more of their products!</li>
            <li> Amazing and good price !!!!</li>
            <li> have been using for about a month on top of vitamin C serum, and it works fine.  It is much thicker than the moisturizer I typically use, was concerned about breaking out, but did not have a problem.  Goes on well, feels good.  Have not noticed my face looking remarkably younger, but we will see with time.</li>
            <li> Ilove this amazing product</li>
            <li> leave face soft and nice (no oily feeling)</li>
            <li> My skin never looked better,  very satisfied with the results!!!</li>
            <li> The seller got it to me right on time and I really do love&lt;br /&gt;this lotion..I use it on my forearms and I can really tell a&lt;br /&gt;difference in my skin. I was a sun worshipper back in the&lt;br /&gt;day and have damage and this cream seems to be&lt;br /&gt;helping. The &amp;#34;sun spots&amp;#34; are lightening also.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> Feels great Absorbs quickly.  Wish the smell was bettet but i can&#x27;t complain at least i am not allergic to anything in it.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin nice and smooth!!! Great product would buy again</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!&lt;br /&gt;Makes my skin so soft and younger looking! !</li>
            <li> This was an excellent product!</li>
            <li> I have seen some improvement, but no dramatic difference. In truth, I have not used it twice daily as directed.  I will do so in the future.</li>
            <li> I like the way it makes my skin feel and try to use it at least once a day along with the Vitamin C Serum. The smells of all the InstaNatural products are heavenly and the products make my skin feel wonderful.</li>
            <li> It works great, non greasy, a natural smell</li>
            <li> What a great anti aging moisturizer!. The texture, smell and result is amazing!. I can see the difference of my skin for two weeks of using. My pores get smaller, soften the skin and doesn&#x27;t break me out!.&lt;br /&gt;Must have product for night cream!.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t won the lottery (yet!) so, when I shop, I want the most bang for my buck. Youth Express Age-Defying Moisturizer fits the bill - and then some! This moisturizer contains a remarkable combination of many of the best as well as time-proven ingredients available for improving and maintaining healthy, beautiful skin. I&#x27;ve been using it - morning and night - for a little over a month. My friends and family have been complimenting my skin, saying that it has never looked better! I can see and feel the difference as well. My skin feels hydrated, soft, protected. It&#x27;s tone has greatly-improved. I&#x27;ve had zero breakouts since I began using this moisturizer and my blackheads... what blackheads? I use this product in a daily regimen (wash, tone, serum, moisturizer). I&#x27;ve noticed a significant improvement in my skin in a number of ways. Smells like cucumbers. Rich texture. Terrific, effective ingredients; Made in the USA; A generous 3.4-oz. What&#x27;s not to Love?</li>
            <li> Love,love,love have noticed such a huge difference in my skin its not even funny. Its so affordable you just can&#x27;t beat it</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product and even more the customer service. I had questions and was surprised when they called me back and were very willing and helpful.  My skin is smoother and softer than every. My daughter even commented on my skin looking better and she did not know I had switched products. I moisture lasts all day and I am not flakey and dry even on my arms.</li>
            <li> Oh so creamy,moist,my face drinks it up and it shows. Please do just a few thing in this life for yourself,get this moisturizer, you will thank you yourself morning and night.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer. The packaging is great, it has a pump which I love because pumps keep the product uncontaminated by regular skin bacteria, and it is quite big, too, so it will last for a while. It has a stronger odor than that you might be used to, but to me personally it&#x27;s fine. It has a thick consistency, but it is absorbed fast by the skin, do not leaving residues. It is good for oily skin as well, because it won&#x27;t clog the pores and make the skin oily after a few minutes. I can feel my skin tightening after I apply the cream, as it works it&#x27;s way through the skin layers. The cucumber and aloe give a fresh sensation as well. It works good on fine lines, and it has many effective ingredients to fight the aging process and renew the skin such as hyaluronic and lactic acids, glycolic acid, and Vitamin C. Because it helps resurfacing the skin, it also improves the tone, and diminishes some spots you may have here and there. I have noticed a better tone and a more even texture on my face. This product has organic ingredients, it is not tested on animals, and is made in USA.dont forget to apply sunscreen before going outside, and enjoy the great benefits of this moisturizer. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I enjoy it&#x27;s herbal fragrance and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin shiny or greasy like so many other products.  I would definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this moisturizer, but I just can&#x27;t.  First of all, it smells funky - like I&#x27;m putting salad dressing on my face.  I like a lot of InstaNatural products, so I didn&#x27;t want to give such a bad review, but this heavy, smelly cream just doesn&#x27;t work!  Secondly, it contains beeswax, a known comedogenic ingredient that doesn&#x27;t belong in a facial moisturizer. Being a skin care junkie, I would&#x27;ve tolerated the smell, and greasy feel if it was beneficial for my skin. However, after using it for a week with no results, and even a few minor breakouts, I tossed it in the trash.</li>
            <li> LOVE this moisturizer!! I will be buying several more products from InstaNatural after having used this &amp; the Vitamin C serum for about 3 weeks now. Surprised &amp; impressed!</li>
            <li> Leaves your face really oily, and worst of all the smell can be very overwhelming, I thought I could just get through the smell but I just couldnt so I stopped using.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and my foundation didn&#x27;t go on as smoothly.  I still have wrinkles and they don&#x27;t look like they are getting any smaller.</li>
            <li> Helps a lot if you have wrinkles and dry skin. Very moisturizing and smells good! Leaves your skin feeling smooth and soft!</li>
            <li> Love all products I have purchased from this company!</li>
            <li> Fabulous!  Wish it was in a larger container.  It is like mousse for the face!</li>
            <li> This lotion seemed moisturizing enough, but the smell was quite off putting to me and I a not sensitive to smells. IT smelled very chemical-ish.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it a couple of weeks, but I do like the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Feels nice on me face.</li>
            <li> All the Instanatural line are very consistent, I love the quality of the texture of this product.</li>
            <li> I much prefer the night cream over this. This moisturizer has a moldy smell to it and leaves a sticky residue. I am returning it and going back to the night cream.</li>
            <li> I have the most sensitive skin on the planet and believed I would need to buy the other expensive cream my whole life, but I gave this a try and it&#x27;s even better than the one I had been using!  No irritation at all, moisturizes well and feels good on the skin. It smells a little like grass initially but the smell fades quickly. I use this with the Hyaluronic Acid Serum and my skin looks great and even better FEELS great!</li>
            <li> Great product. My mom uses it every morning &amp; night</li>
            <li> I use this day and night on my face and neck. Face feels really hydrated all day long and the fine lines on my neck seems to be lighter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW***</li>
            <li> The serums are the best products this company offers versus these moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Spend your money on the C serum, the Hyd. Acid serum, and the Retinol serum --- I swear by these top notch products.&lt;br /&gt;Also get the 4oz of Argan Oil ( certified organic ) --- the only one I buy and use liberally on face and hair and hands.&lt;br /&gt;Indispensible.</li>
            <li> This a great product. It has a nice smell and it seems to really impart moisture into my dry/oily/complicated skin. I also felt like it gave a little brightness to some of the dull parts of my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Put it on after my routine face wash and it leave my face soft all day. Not dry or greasy. Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great for sun damaged face!</li>
            <li> This product has made my face so smooth and because I can see changes happen so quickly, it makes me use the product with consistency!</li>
            <li> bought my second bottle and its almost empty now.. im just so sad that it doesnt not work on me..i still have wrinkles and even reduce the appearance of it as what it claims it would do to your skin..i had really high hopes because im still under 30 with visible lines on my face..</li>
            <li> A lightweight, non-greasy, but rich and hydrating moisturizer.  One pump from an easy pump bottle will cover the entire face and neck - the product is a white creamy consistency with no discernible fragrance.  You can wear this daily, it absorbs easily into the skin.  It can be used on top of other specific target-area serums and eye creams to help lock in moisture.  It serves as a protective barrier between your skin and the elements (although it is not a sunscreen).  A lovely daily moisturizer with excellent ingredients at an affordable price.  PS if you are looking for an easy moisturizer to give a man in your life, this is a great option as the packaging is simple, it&#x27;s easy to use and it has no offensive smell.  A very practical gift!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer works best for me at night. It is a thicker formula that seemed to not want to soak into my skin at first. I almost thought that I wouldn&#x27;t use it again but it quickly soaked in once I rubbed it in all the way and my skin feels fabulous. Since it is a thick moisturizer I use it at night because my makeup applied weird. The only smell that I can pick up is cocoa butter so it is a very mild smell. This is packed full of nutrient rich ingredients that are especially good and nourishing for your skin. I highly recommend this to anyone with dry skin because it definitely wouldn&#x27;t take long to knock out the dry patches.&lt;br /&gt;*I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li> This has a nice light smell to it, has a consistency that&#x27;s not too thin and not thick but a nice medium. It rubs in easily and I don&#x27;t have to use too much. So far I really like how it makes the skin on my face look and feel.</li>
            <li> I started using InstaNaturals Anti-Aging Moisturizer in conjunction with their Retinol Serum because I was in need of a pick me up. My skin has been looking dull and this gave me the glow I was looking for. It started off subtle but I complexly notice a change. It says on the bottle that it can be used on other areas so I have also used it on the top of my hands in hopes to help with the unsightly dry appearance. I&#x27;m really glad I have been able to try out  InstaNaturals Anti-Aging Moisturizer, I&#x27;m starting to fall in love with the company, I just wish they had a kit!</li>
            <li> I love the way this cream makes my face feel!  As I have gotten older (darn it) I have gotten choosier about the products I put on my face.  This is a rich cream and seems to almost &amp;#34;fill in the little wrinkles&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s an excellent moisturizer!</li>
            <li> It does what it promises.</li>
            <li> I got my hands on Age - Defying Moisturizer which is to help hydrate your face and body. This product is great because I can use it all over. Honestly who really has the time to have separate creams for multiple uses. Not to mention the time to apply those creams to specific areas. As a woman on the go I need quick, easy and simple. One thing I look for in a product is how quick does it work and when will I see results. With a moisturizer its like a first date you can usually tell after one use if you will use the product again. I can say that I will be using this product again because it can be used on my body and is gentle enough for my face. That sold me instantly! but once I tried the product I found that I actually like it. The scent is faint to none, It is not irritating and after on use my skin was softer and healthy looking. The product is non greasy and super absorbent and most importantly I didn&#x27;t have any reactions.</li>
            <li> I used this product and also let my mom use this cream.  She liked it more than I did.  I don&#x27;t really go for moisturizers that are scented, but my mom thought it smelled good.  I don&#x27;t have many fine lines but I thought that cream made my skin more hydrated.  My mom really liked it.  We both noticed that her skin looked younger.  I would use this again if they made an unscented version, but that&#x27;s just my opinion.  I was given this product free for me to review</li>
            <li> Horrible smell is a breaker for me. Overpriced. No noticeable difference from other moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give a 3 star if it wasn&#x27;t for the smell.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to future wonderful results!</li>
            <li> good product easy absorb</li>
            <li> This product is okay. Goes on kind of heavy and greasy and has an unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I have been using it now for about 2 weeks or so, 2 times a day morning and night, I do not see any difference in my facial appearance yet, still have the fine lines and age spots.  but I still have high hopes that it will help with the wrinkles, crows feet so we will see.  It has a nice texture and the smell is nice and it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling or heavy feeling on your face.  It does absorb well into the skin.  I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay. the scent is strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product once so far, so I cannot say much.  I will do a proper review when I&#x27;ve used it for at least a month straight.  :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> I love it! It&#x27;s calming, moisturizing but not to heavy. I have sensitive skin and I&#x27;m prone to breaking out and this lotion (along with their other products) is helping my skin stay balanced. I&#x27;m using the vitamin C face wash, age defying toner, vitamin C serum, eye serum and this moisturizer. I&#x27;m very happy with all of their products. Hoping to try the skin brightening products soon!</li>
            <li> I have only  been using the product for a couple of weeks and my skin did have to get used to a new face care regimen. I do think I am going to really like the product. It is lightweight under my make up and I feel like my face is brighter already.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a month along with some other items by the company. I like that it is light weight and you get a lot for your money.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a perfect day cream for a long time. I&#x27;ve tried every natural skin product you can name. I&#x27;ve been using InstaNatural for 3 weeks now and I&#x27;m very impressed!</li>
            <li> This is another great product from InstaNatural that I love.  It is a perfect daytime moisturizer with a light pick-me-up fresh scent that I enjoy.  I am so happy I found InstaNaturals so I can finally feel good about what I putting on my skin.  The list of ingredients is amazing...everything that should be there...is.  It is nourishing and effective.  A winner!</li>
            <li> “I&#x27;m getting compliments, so it must be helping. I use it in the&lt;br /&gt;morning and a night time moisturizer in the evening.”</li>
            <li> This is such a great moisturizer. I usually have issues with my oily skin but this product keeps my face PERFECTLY moisturized and soft. It also has a light, clean, natural scent.</li>
            <li> I like that is not greasy. I think it works well. It does kind of smell like butt for the first 30 second when you are putting it on, but that goes away.</li>
            <li> Love this cream and the cocoa buttery scent but the packaging is too bulky and inconvenient, give me a simple jar or tube any day please</li>
            <li> I love my new face cream. Its not too greasy and it feels great on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update 9/11/2015 - I have bought my second bottle of cream and I still love it. It works as a great moisterizer to use before make up.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer feels great going on. It is creamy and rich, without being at all greasy. I love the natural ingredients and do think that it is hydrating and brightening my skin at the same time. The best thing is that it does not have chemical that are often included in skin care products that can be harmful to your health. I highly recommend this emollient moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product.  She bought this and the night cream and uses it everyday.  She had family and friends tell me my skin looks good.  They had no idea she is using this product.  Her skin is so much softer and looks fresh.  It is not greasy and a little goes a long way.  She has  found her line of beauty products forever.  She has health issues and is always reading labels and tried this line because of ingredients.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered on time and was well packaged.  Product is a good size and the pump looks very easy to use.  Most of the ingredients look very natural without a lot of chemicals.  I am looking forward to fantastic results from this product!</li>
            <li> Maybe my skin is a little unique (I do have combination skin) but this moisturizer unfortunately left a sticky residue on my face.  Although I use moisturizer on a once to twice-daily basis, I do not like feeling it on my face afterwards.  Some great &amp;#34;drier&amp;#34; moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried included Zihr protect, age defying moisturizer which is a night cream, and clinique clear complexion which almost dries like a powder.  I still use the eye gel I bought from this company, but this moisturizer unfortunately did not work.  Not a bad price point tho.</li>
            <li> While pregnant with my son, my sixth pregnancy, my skin became very dry and even flaky.  This helped with my skin tone and brought out the soft part of my skin.  It wasn&#x27;t the dry flaky type of skin that it had been throughout the pregnancy.  I do have to say that I would recommend this to any other mom or just someone with dry skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got these as a review. No other compensation has been given.</li>
            <li> This is a multipurpose moisturizer. I have started using it as night cream for my face and hands. I love that it is made with great nutrients such as Vitamin C and B5,  Cocoa  Butter, Aloe Vera, and Rosehip Oil.  This product is absorbed quickly into the skin. It is not greasy feeling and I love that. It also  has a nice pleasant scent. I just started using this product, but I can tell it is a winner. It works on wrinkles, fine lines, age spots, scars, and discolorations. 98% of this product is made with natural organic ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I am looking forward to all the benefits this product has to offer.</li>
            <li> I got this for part of a gift basket I am putting together for my sisters 21st birthday (anti aging hahah) I have heard great things! I was sold after watching a youtube review about instanatural products. I look forward to hearing about the results! If it is good. I may get one for myself too.</li>
            <li> Works Wonders!  Face was very dry, used the moisturizer and skin feels great.</li>
            <li> I am going to continue to buy this item. My skin feels so much smoother. Great product!</li>
            <li> My face is dry. This is the second bottle. After I used one bottle, I changed another brand, but I didn&#x27;t like. So, I ordered again. This moisturizer helps my face to be whiter and smoother, but I feel that a little helpful for Anti-Aging.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel soft and appears to last all day</li>
            <li> This is a thick but not greasy moisturizing product.  My skin condition seems to have improved with continued use and I&#x27;ve become less susceptible to ingrown hairs.  Very happy.</li>
            <li> Perfect for dry weather. My skin feels and looks amazing even with our nasty winds  that normally dry my face out this is not the case anymore thanks to InstaNatural.</li>
            <li> Could be great if only they put SPF in it. Due to the fact that they don&#x27;t, I wont buy it again. Its ridiculous that they don&#x27;t have any products with SPF in it for daily use.  Just silly.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!!! Love the pump, It goes on smooth &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel, I&#x27;m new with this but so far I couldn&#x27;t be happier, I wish I woulda seen this years ago, I&#x27;m HOOKED on there whole line of products</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Love this facial moisturizer! I use it daily bases, mostly in the morning before I put on my sunblocks. It&#x27;s like all in one cream to give the best to the skin. Good to travel with too.</li>
            <li> Let me just say this product works amazing. It is simple to apply which I normally do once in the morning and once before the bed. It is even safe aroun the eyes. I started using about two weeks and I noticed the difference. Really good moisteruzer. Highly recommend . Loved.</li>
            <li> I like this product it&#x27;s good for my dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I received the lotion very quickly and was excited to try it. Unfortunately the lotion has a really strong smell . It&#x27;s not a bad smell but a very strong flowery smell that gave me a bad headache. It also is a heavy lotion that made my face feel oily. I really wanted to like the product but will be throwing it in the trash.</li>
            <li> I have been loving my Insta Natural Products. It is definitely up there on my list of favorite brands for natural beauty products. They are always generous in product size, and their ingredients as always top notch. Results? They are not dramatic (yet), but a noticeable difference is evident by the test subject and some impartial observers also. His treated arm is softer with fewer noticeable wrinkles. The treated side of his face seems firmer and less wrinkly than the untreated side. He likes the feel of the cream on his skin and the subtle but pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I receive this product on discount for reviewing purposes</li>
            <li> This does not smell good at all. . Left my face very greasy feeling and the next day after using, my face had begun breaking out.  :(</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month and it works amazing. It goes on thick and has a slightly sticky texture but it absorbs into your skin fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> Love everything about this cream. I was worried the AHA&#x27;s in it would make my skin sensitive to the sun, but so far its been fine. This moisturizer is very creamy, but absorbs fast and sinks right into my skin. It can be used on both face and body, which is an added bonus! I&#x27;ve mainly been using on on my chest area which has some sun damage spots I want to clear up. Its been working great so far, improving the texture and tone of my skin. I do use a SS afterwards to prevent future sun damage.</li>
            <li> Tried their age defying eye cream and love it. This is one of my morning facial care routine products. It keeps my skin hydrated and smooth. Goes great with their VC serum together. Nice packaging. Great quality and very affordable. Will buy more.</li>
            <li> I love that the ingredients are natural and do not irritate my skin.  I was afraid that using during the summer months on my oily skin would be a problem but as I am only using at night it works great.</li>
            <li> Great size of the bottles a lot of product for a razonable price</li>
            <li> Bought this moisturiser after a lot of research and I am glad I did get it all the way to India ! Have to admit that it was a bit pricey but definitely worth it. I loved the neat packaging, the pump of the bottle makes it easier to use and does not cause any wastage. Contrary to a lot of reviews, I did like the smell and given the fact that it has all natural ingredients makes it very effective.&lt;br /&gt;Its been two weeks since I had used it, the cream is a bit thick and little goes a long way. Since I have dry, red skin it worked well on my skin type. I found this to be very hydrating and my acne scars seem to fade away. I use this in conjunction with the retinol serum and surprisingly, the small acne that were on my face dried out and disappeared within two days ! My face looks plump and can immediately see a difference in the quality of my skin in terms of brightness and tone. Absolutely recommend this for all skin types. The best part- it has no parabens. Go get some of this and thank you instanatural for such an amazing customer service.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product, I spend a lot of time outdoors and the face was taking a beating. This moisturizer did the trick, people have remarked that I look  little younger. Hey, for a guy creeping in on 50 i&#x27;ll take it, try the product you&#x27;ll love it. I run a lot also and this product doesn&#x27;t sting your eyes as you sweat. - Brad in Michigan</li>
            <li> InstaNatural has done it again!&lt;br /&gt;I cannot possibly say enough wonderful things about their products, and this age-defying moisturizer is no exception! My claims have even caught the attention of my husband, and he&#x27;s been sneaking to use this as well!&lt;br /&gt;With sensitive skin, I am always hesitant to introduce a new product into my regimen, but this is 98% natural, and uses so many organic ingredients that I felt safe trying.  I am not disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;Their main list of ingredients are MSM, rose hip oil, vitamin c, cocoa butter, johoba oil, and hyaluronic acid.&lt;br /&gt;So far, this amazing moisturizer has evened my skins texture and tone, and I&#x27;m sure is working in countless other ways that I cant see it am not privy to just yet.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what amazing results are in store!</li>
            <li> I cant wait to see the end result with using this item for a few weeks, i know it will work</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is ok. It is very thick and so one pump is really all I need which is nice. It has an odd smell, that is slightly unpleasant to me, but maybe that is a personal preference. I wouldn&#x27;t say it is life-changing, but the pump is convenient and the size will last you a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> i received this a gift of my boyfriend and i can tell you that is REALLY IS AMAZING WORK IN FEW FEW DAY I RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT is soft no smell is too much good my skin look every day most beauty i am happy ,i use eye gel every night and this is best combination if you want best product this is .customer service is nice and i feel a vip people</li>
            <li> Do not use this if you are prone to break outs!</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying the InstaNatural line and I have been thrilled with the results! I put this on every morning before putting on my make-up and it keeps my skin nice and moisturized throughout the day. The scent is nice and light, and I actually enjoy the texture of it - very easy to put on and smooth over my face. After about a week of using it I have noticed that my skin is already softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is great, especially for the generous size, and I don&#x27;t see myself going back to drug store moisturizers anytime soon!</li>
            <li> This is a Great moisturizer. It is a nice size bottle also.</li>
            <li> I like how the product moisturizes my skin.  Keeps it nice and soft and plump.  Only downfall I have with it is that it could have a better smell to it.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.  It leaves the skin soft and non-greasy.  I only wish it had sunscreen added OR perhaps one that gives some color like J&amp;uuml;rgen&#x27;s that has some color AND sunscreen.  Since I usually use the InstaNatural product which contains Retinol, I use this moisturizer either at night or on a non sunny day.  Otherwise I&#x27;m very happy with it!!!</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and this moisturizer is great.</li>
            <li> The cream is a little heavier than I like but does absorb quickly. I have only been using for a week so it is too early to tell if it holds up to its claims.</li>
            <li> Love how my skin feels!  It has so many ingredients that I was applying but now they are all and some others in one bottle.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> I have two main problems with this product:&lt;br /&gt;1. Each time I use it on my face, I am guaranteed a breakout. Particularly annoying is it creates whiteheads in the crease around my nose and around my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;2. While other reviewers have found this cream to be &amp;#34;easy to apply&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;light-feeling&amp;#34;, I have the opposite opinion. This cream is excessively thick - it would be easier to smear cocoa butter on my face. Half a pump is all I would use while applying to my face, and I was left feeling as if my skin needed to breathe (possibly leading to the breakouts).&lt;br /&gt;Aside from those criticisms, I will continue to use this product - just not on my face! I&#x27;ve been using this on my d&amp;eacute;colletage and arms with great results. The pump bottle is convenient and the cream seems to absorb better on my body than my face.&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed other reviewers have noticed about the scent. Perhaps other batches smell different, but the cream I received smells of its&#x27; ingredients - simply a mixture of jojoba oil, cocoa butter and rosehip oil, and a subtle mix at that.</li>
            <li> Another moisturizer, that I love,leaves your face and body really soft and very,very,moisturized all day,It goes on easy smells good with natural ingredients  that have great benefits for your skin.I HAVE RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED FEEDBACK.</li>
            <li> This is what I&#x27;ve been looking for . Fast shipment!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> After only 2 weeks of using this product, the fine lines around my mouth and forehead have totally disappeared!  This is a great moisturizer and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel.  It absorbs well with.  Shipping was fast and packaged well.  I definitely recommend this moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I just started using this moisturizer and I am noticing that my lines are not as noticeable, but I have also noticed that my skin is more sensitive in the sun. I also like the fact that it is not all thick and leaving a thick film on my face after using.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I am in love with their toner and figured if the ingredients were so awesome in that, they must be great in this too. BUT, like I said in my toner review, I have extremely oily skin and it has taken me years to nail down my facial product routine so I was not about to mess with it. I bought this product to try to deal with the sun damaged skin on the backs of my hands. Many brown spots (from too much sun exposure), wrinkles, dry skin, and crepe like skin. I did get some filler in my hands as they were starting to look like skeletons, and that made them look years younger, but the skin still needed a lot of help. I couldn&#x27;t wait for the bottle to arrive so I could read the ingredients and I wasn&#x27;t let down: Organic Aloe Vera, Cucumber Distillate, Botanical Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin C, Organic Sunflower Oil, Tamanu Oil, Organic Borage Oil, Organic Flax Seed Oil, Organic Evening Primrose Oil, Organic Rosehip Oil, Vitamin B5, Wildcrafted Arnica, Organic Lavender, Organic Calendula, Organic Chamomile, Macadamia Nut Oil, Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Glycolic Acid( to give a very slight peel with each application), Organic Coconut Oil, Squalane, Palm Oil, Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Cocoa Butter, Organic Beeswax, Organic Jojoba Oil, Coenzyme Q10, Phytic Acid, Phospholipids, Grapeseed Oil, Wildcrafted Oregon Grape, Wildcrafted Green Tea, Camellia Oil, Avocado Oil, Wildcrafted Eyebright, Helichrysum Essential Oil, Organic Licorice, Lemongrass, Vitamin C Palmitate, Tocopheryl (Antioxidant), Pyrus Malus, Citrus Medica Lemon, and Sugar Cane. WOW! I was more than impressed. I started by using my Clarisonic on the backs of my hands with a gentle cleanser and patting them dry and applying a small drop of this moisturizer to each hand while it was still moist.The first result I noticed was around days 3-5 yhe dryness was just about disappearing, my skin was soft and smooth. Brown spots took a bit longer, about 2 weeks, to really start to fade, but that is probably because the skin on your hands is so different from your face, and these were some bad brown spots. The wrinkles were the last to respond. While I could see mild improvement at 2 weeks, it took 4 weeks to see significant results. Now I am not hesitant or embarrassed when I have to shake someone&#x27;s hands. I know my hands look and feel good. Now I use an SPF 85 and I can&#x27;t wait to see how much better they will look after I&#x27;ve been using the product for 6 months!</li>
            <li> If a product has “anti-aging” or “age-defying” in the name, you can count on me trying it.  That’s why, when I was offered the opportunity to try the Insta Natural Youth Express Age-Defying Moisturizer, I didn’t hesitate to say “yes”!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the first things I notice about skin care products (especially those that can be used on the face) is the smell.  There’s nothing like rubbing a product all over your face that smells horrible.  Not only does a bad smell start to make me nauseous after a while, it’s sometimes difficult to get rid of, even after attempting to wash it off.  Luckily, however, I didn’t have a bad experience in that regard with this product.  The moisturizer has a very pleasant scent.  I can’t quite put my finger on it, but perhaps it’s a hint of a citrus scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is not lightweight.  It’s a heavy cream that is somewhat difficult to spread and goes on very thick.  Don’t get me wrong, I’ve tried heavier products that I love, but I prefer those that are lightweight and easy to apply.  If it does a great job of conquering my skin care concerns, however, that’s the least of my worries.  Nevertheless, it does have a heavy feel and takes a while to be absorbed by the skin.  The good news, though, is that it is long-lasting and once absorbed, leaves my skin feeling soft and silky-smooth.  Due to the heavy weight of the cream, I prefer to use it on my body, but not my face.  I have other products that work phenomenally on my face that I have opted to stick with instead.  Furthermore, I didn’t notice any significant changes in fine lines or wrinkles, which is another reason that I’ll opt not to use this on my face.  My preference is to actually use it as a hand cream.  My hands tend to crack and become dry very easily these days, but this cream leaves them feeling very soft and touchable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the label, the product states it is a “face &amp; body hydrating treatment.”  Considering the fact that the thickness of the product is what likely locks in the moisture and results in the long-lasting effects, I would say that is accurate, making it worthwhile to keep this product around, as it does what it is advertised to do, which is a HUGE factor for me when it comes to reviewing products.kness of the product is what likely locks in the moisture and results in the long-lasting effects, I would say that is accurate, making it worthwhile to keep this product around, as it does what it is advertised to do, which is a HUGE factor for me when it comes to reviewing products.</li>
            <li> Great face lotion, great ingredients, not a fan of the smell though. The product seems to work well enough but I hate the smell, to be honest. I have to go heavy with the cologne after using this. The smell isn&#x27;t that bad but it&#x27;s less than optimal I wish I could give this 3.5 stars but that&#x27;s not an option.</li>
            <li> My mom asked me to post this review... she was born in 1955.....&lt;br /&gt;I have used this cream for a month and I have noticed the lines on the sides of both eyes vanishing and the skin getting a youthful plump look. I have had no side affects from the sun and I have not gotten it in my eyes. I have tried 4 others creams without any noticeable change. This cream is giving me some great results. I am reordering 2 more and I plan to keep using this product.... Thank You T.K.</li>
            <li> I only used the product once, I didn&#x27;t like the way it smells</li>
            <li> This is a decent moisturizer, but not the best one for me. Call me crazy but it smells a little like celery and I had to reapply to my face pretty frequently. It gets the job done though. I&#x27;m finishing up the bottle on my legs since the skin there is less finicky than my face.</li>
            <li> I am old enough to need a wrinkle remover but also old enough to know that no cream can erase deep wrinkles,  but I can still hope. Having said that I didn&#x27;t have high expectations in that regard but I did want a good moisturizer with natural ingredients. This really fit the bill. It has a very pleasant fragrance that is not added artificially and it goes on light as air but really holds in the moisture. I don&#x27;t usually like a sort of pump foam cream but this is so silky and light and yet effective I am a fan. I&#x27;ve only used it for about two weeks and I do believe that the appearance of the lines around my eyes and mouth are reduced. I live in Hawaii and have a lot of sun damage and this is very effective and soothing on my arms and chest as well. I noticed from the reviews that some people experienced some irritation but I certainly did not. All around I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> very watered down. was nothing like i expected. used for 2 weeks straight.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll keep my skin soft and moist , No oil. First open ,I did not like this product the smell,After one month used this product ,I am feeling ok.</li>
            <li> Very good! Products works just like i need it to! I will buy again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good moisturizer for a while now and had high hopes for this one. After the first use, I noticed that it was a little greasy and my skin felt a little sticky. Then I smelled it. I immediately washed it off because the scent was so strong and I definitely didn&#x27;t like it. Therefore, I can comment on how well it actually moisturizes because I haven&#x27;t used it since. Hopefully, if you like the scent, it works well for you but unfortunately it won&#x27;t be a product I&#x27;d use again.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. It has a nice consistency and goes on smoothly.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I just received my product so I have not used it but a few days but, it feels very smooth on my skin. Even after I have worn  it for  a while, my skin still feels very soft.</li>
            <li> So far, so good. I think it&#x27;s working very well. It&#x27;s not sticky like other moisturizers I have used, and you don&#x27;t need a lot for it to be effective.</li>
            <li> Bouth this with serum , and makes my skin pure then befoure , love this</li>
            <li> Very nice texture and nice results. I would definitely buy it again. My only issue is that it is a bit heavy following application.</li>
            <li> It works beautifully I really like this company that makes these products. My skin looks very good!</li>
            <li> Another great product. I use it after I apply the serum. Great combination. No side effects like blemish or redness or irritation for me. I will definetly purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I had been using a pricey product that promised to restore my skin and give me back that youthful glow. Within a few days of using instanatural my face began to feel more moist and I got my glow back!</li>
            <li> It was okay... Didn&#x27;t care for smell..</li>
            <li> Been using it for awhile and Im noticing fewer wrinkles and softer skin</li>
            <li> While this product moisturizes, it feels thicker than I am used to with facial creams. A noticed a slight burn due to the hyaluronic acid but over a week, smoother skin appearance. This acid is commonly used as a filler/protectant in spas/salons. I use it sparingly and still get a great effect from it. Great price for this item.</li>
            <li> One of the nicest moisturizers I&#x27;ve found at this price point (~$25).</li>
            <li> Like most women (especially us over 40) I try everything. Well it feels like it anyway. Add in the desire to be paraben-free, and the search feels endless. But I am so happy I found this line of skin care. I love these products! First time I&#x27;ve ever had something where I really did notice the difference. I was even asked if I&#x27;d had a facial recently (no) because my skin looks so good. If I notice and others notice, then hooray! And the price is really good. Might my search be over?</li>
            <li> Greasy for me to use, will not allow my makeup to absorb. My makeup seems to just sit on top and disappear easily. I don&#x27;t feel it moisturizes in the amazing manner I expected.  Smell is fine. Pump top seems fragile and I fear breaking it. Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer goes on very rich, which I like because I have dry skin. The fragrance is a little earthy, but not as bad as others, and it is tolerable and after it&#x27;s applied, I don&#x27;t notice it a bit.  It&#x27;s my new favorite and have reordered.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my cousin and she loves it!!! she feels rejuvenated already and she just started using it 5 days ago.</li>
            <li> Switched to this from Clinique moisturizing gel for my combo dry/oily skin. This works GREAT on the parts of my face that get really dry, but it works a little too well on the oily parts too. Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer!  love that it came in a pump bottle (makes it super easy to use)  It has a nice smooth, yet light texture to it which makes it very easy to apply. It absorbs well with no greasy residue and it doesn&#x27;t make your face look shiny, so that makes it great to put on under makeup. I found myself using this product more as part of my bedtime routine because after washing and removing my makeup at the end of the day, I felt my face needed some &amp;#34;nourishment&amp;#34; and this works great. My skin feels hydrated and soft after I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Over all, I had a great experience with the InstaNatural&#x27;s Age-Defying Moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I like it. It does have a strong cocoa scent which I don&#x27;t love, but others might. It is a very thick cream but seems to absorb fast.</li>
            <li> Not sure, it&#x27;s been 10 days since I am using and I did not notice any improvement yet. May be its too early. Will give some more time.</li>
            <li> Awesome.  My husband has definitely noticed.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Feels good on my face and seems to be taking away fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> One star is for its promotional price and nice packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product may have promising ingredients but if you can&#x27;t stomach its smell, then you won&#x27;t benefit from it.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if the item I got is just a bad batch or something. I was processing a return right now and it says &amp;#34;Item should be received by 3/23.&amp;#34; I mean today is 3/23 at 8PM. Anyway, like I said, product is beautifully packaged until you pump a little and prepare yourself to gag with its odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, it smells really bad.</li>
            <li> it is good, after use it for a week, i can feel different than before. less wrinkle.</li>
            <li> Great results. Fast shipping. Very happy with product.</li>
            <li> Nice, smooth moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Have used it for a month. It goes on smoothly and not greasy. I have seen some changes in that my skin looks more moisturized and youthful.</li>
            <li> Very nice product with high level of moisturizing!</li>
            <li> my husband has been using this product daily and he loves it. So light on his skin and light scent.</li>
            <li> I like it very much, it keeps my skin moist all day</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 is because it doesn&#x27;t have an spf, and I liven Colorado where that&#x27;s pretty important. But still, I&#x27;ll be buying this product again!.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer-I a now using the Instanatural Serum,retinol cream and moisturizing cream.  It only takes a small amount and the difference in my skin is that it has a prettier soft, clean look</li>
            <li> This is great, makes my skin so smooth and soft after a day in the sun. I love the scent, and I use it on my hands at night as well as my face.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this moisturizer is working or not. I stopped using it after two times because I don&#x27;t like its scent. It smells like some salad dressing. However, I will try some other products from the same company..or maybe give this moisturizer another chance.</li>
            <li> I have tried several anti-aging facial moistutizers and this is one of the best.  It is gentle to the skin and reduced the appearance of fine lines and age spots. Great product.</li>
            <li> I really have enjoyed the cream. It has a nice consistency and absorbs easily. My skin feels soft and hydrated all day without feeling heavy or greasy. The smell is not my favorite but it doesn&#x27;t bother me and doesn&#x27;t seem to linger.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product; I love it! I also received excellent tips from the seller, as well. I am very pleased! Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I am no youngster and was not expecting miracles but I am very happy with my skin.  I also love the fact that you get a good amount of product and the price is wonderful.  I also like the customer service, they are very interested in your happiness with their products.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Strange smell but send to work as a fault moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Only been using it for a week but I have seen some improvement</li>
            <li> Moisturizer feels nice.</li>
            <li> This is VERY moisturizing and works well. I have been using it since I received it and love it! This is a great add to facial care!</li>
            <li> The are amazing. I can tell a huge difference in just using these products for 1week.</li>
            <li> While this was a little heavy for my taste to use as a facial moisturizer, I am more than happy to give it 5 stars because it is an EXCELLENT eye makeup remover! It does not sting at all and all the wonderful oils immediately dissolve my eye makeup. And because it is a cream I don&#x27;t feel like it tugs at my eyes as I wipe it away. I just bought my second bottle today.</li>
            <li> This product moisturizes well, not greasy or heavy.  I use it with the Hyaluronic Acid serum.  Love the 2 together. Only been a couple of weeks, noticing a bit more firmness. I cant wait to try their other product too.</li>
            <li> This facial moisturizer is really great.  It goes onto the skin silky &amp; smoothly.  It absorbs quickly &amp; leaves my skin softly moisturized.  I really like it &amp; highly recommend it to anyone who needs a boost with dry facial skin..  Best of all, it does not leave an oily/greasy residue.  Just beautifully moisturized skin.  Give it a try &amp; I think you will be pleasantly surprised...........another winner from AMAZON!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Would like to see more products on sale or a nice BOGO once in a while....</li>
            <li> I love this product been using it for 3 weeks now!! 5 stars</li>
            <li> I like this product for the fact that it is 98% natural. Gives me a sense of satisfaction and confidence knowing what I put on to my face is free of harmful chemicals that will potentially damage my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how easy it is on my skin, it is creamy yet absorbs quickly leaving my face feeling clean, smooth and beautiful. It’s summertime and this product is exactly what I need, I want my face to be moisturized at the same time don’t give me that oily feeling when I go out there to run errands or do my chores under the sun.</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer for about two weeks and really like it!  After only one week I was able to see an improvement in my forehead lines and creases.  I notice a difference in overall texture too. I did have to reduce my use to once a day as twice was causing some irritation bumps, but my skin tends to be mildly sensitive to alpha hydroxy products. I already recommended this to a friend and plan on ordering the eye cream as well.</li>
            <li> All day moisture for your face, neck and decollete can be attained in one simple step, InstaNatural Youth Express Age Defying Moisturizer. I have been using InstaNatural Youth Express Age Defying Moisturizerfollow for the past three weeks and I immediately noticed the lasting feeling of all day moisture when used on my face and neck. My skin appeared more luminous, and who couldn’t use a bit more luminosity in their day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply InstaNatural Mositurizer after washing with mild cleanser and applying Vitamin C Serum.  It is a thick, rich formula that absorbs quickly into the skin. I’m able to smooth on BB Cream and concealer within minutes of use of InstaNatural Youth Express Age-Defying Moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a strong smell associated with this product as 98% of its ingredients are all natural, which is not a deterrent for use in my opinion. The first few ingredients listed on the package are organic and several herbal ingredients are listed as well. This product isn’t tested on animals either, which I like very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;InstaNatural also doubles as hand moisturizer. It’s a nice hand moisturizer and not the least bit greasy. My hands appeared younger looking after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note of caution, while this moisturizer is hydrating and provides all day moisture for your face, neck and decollete, sun exposure while using this product will cause dryness and clog pores. Don’t let this stop you if you spend little to no time out-of-doors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the use of  InstaNatural Youth Express Moisturizer as an everyday face, neck and hand cream.</li>
            <li> Very nice lotion. It has a subtle scent, light and nutty, and fairly thick. The bottle is a nice pump and I am able to control the amount I put out.  I have been using this for a month now and I really like how it makes my face feel soft and supple.  Would recommend to anyone who needs moisure.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and it soaks in - not leaving my skin greasy</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of different moisturizers and am always on the alert for something good that won&#x27;t irritate my skin. (I have a mild case of rosacea). I usually choose something with an SPF 20 or more. Since this cream does not have any sunscreen, it would not be my first choice.Despite this, I must say that it is one of the best moisturizers I have ever used. It is neither lightweight and watery nor heavy and creamy. It is almost like putting whipped cream on your face. It goes on smoothly and really does a nice job of moisturizing. The scent is pleasant. Directions say to put a serum on first and I did that, so there was an extra step, but I still like this well enough that I would recommend. There&#x27;s no way to know if it would long-term reduce my wrinkles but it certainly won&#x27;t make them worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, you pump this out into your hand and then rub it on. So be careful, you don&#x27;t want to waste this stuff. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Are you guys looking for a really good moisturizer that isn&#x27;t full of chemicals? I don&#x27;t know about most of you but I have been trying to switch over once I run out of my other skincare products to ones that are more natural and/or organic. I found this one recently from Instanatural and it&#x27;s called Youth Express Age Defying Moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have RA and Fibromyalgia so the bigger tops and such help me out quite a lot. I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I have hurt my fingers trying to get something to come out of bottles, cans, etc. I have no strength anymore so I need for things to be easy to open and not give me hassles when trying to use. The products that I have reviewed so far from Instanatural are among the easiest to open and use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going to say earlier that I thought the cream smelled like cucumbers but then thought I was imagining it but there it is in the ingredients list above! And no, I try not to read about a product until the day I write the review so nothing influences my testing. I actually did not know that cucumbers had an anti-aging capability, did you? Well, I guess I will be paying more attention to my natural ingredients from now on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also learned that this moisturizer has a shelf life of 24 months, which for me is totally awesome! I have bad health spells from time to time where I don&#x27;t even think about using my skincare, so I have had products expire before I get them all used up and this is really awesome news for me because now I can finally use all the product up before it expires! I know, it&#x27;s the little things in life that excite me nowadays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer is safe for all skin types so you don&#x27;t have to worry about getting Normal, Dry or Oily. I don&#x27;t know about you, but it&#x27;s mind boggling when you have to separate everything that way. It is also safe to use around the eyes and I have been doing that without any problems. I have found that the face moisturizers are just as good as the eye ones, so why buy both? Now, serums and gels are different and they do different things, so this only applies to cream moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also been using it on the top of my hands because they are getting that old look to them and now they are regaining some of that radiant glow about them. So, experiment with your moisturizer to see if it can help you in other areas as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember it took awhile for your skin to get loose, wrinkles and fine lines, so please give this product time to work before you stop using. I always apply the 30 day rule so that you can really see the differences in your skin. It will be more firm, smoother and fresh looking or radiant if you prefer that word. I can honestly say I am very happy with my results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I have stated before, I have really dry skin and one of my main concerns is getting moisture to my face and this moisturizer does just that. My skin no longer feels tough, it is a lot smoother and even my husband has noticed!es, so why buy both?

            <li> I was lucky enough to receive this to review on my blog and I love it! It&#x27;s almost all natural and leaves my face fresh and wonderful! It evens out my combination skin and I don&#x27;t even have any dry spots. Love love love!</li>
            <li> Great to use for non greasy and effective skin care. I like that it makes my skin feel soft and supple and helps to promote a wrinkle free face.</li>
            <li> I just used this cream for two more days. Can&#x27;t say more about it. Right now just feel my face not dry. Will write more after I use 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Put it on in the morning after a hot shower and it just dissolves into my skin, leaving it feeling smooth and firmer. However, it&#x27;s true that it doesn&#x27;t function as a proper moisturizer which I apply separately on top if needed.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Works great....one of the best moisturizers I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell very good and felt heavy on my skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this along with the Hyaluronic Acid Serum and they work perfectly together.  I also used both products on my hands and noticed a visible improvement in the elasticity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried (and loved) InstaNatural&#x27;s Vitamin C Eye Gel so I was happy to take advantage of a special price and try their Anti-Aging Facial Moisturizer. Absolutely love it. The texture is phenomenal so it doesn&#x27;t take much per application and it smells citrusy and fresh. Great pump bottle keeps product germ-free. I use it on my neck as well. I recommend!</li>
            <li> I had the privilege to have tried the Insta Natural Youth Express Eye Gel recently (see review HERE) and the results where amazing. So it was truly a testament to  how much I love the company that I decided to try another product to see if I can claim the same results and benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are getting older. It&#x27;s true. If we except that truth we can focus on making it much better. One of those things is truly finding great skincare that matches the healthy foods we feed our bodies. Insta Natural Youth Express Age Defying Moisturizer is one of those perfect skin matches. It helps balance redness, tighten and tones the skin, aids dryness, and improves those stubborn fine lines and wrinkles. I don&#x27;t know about you but I like radiant, healthy, and glowing skin. Why not try a product that can help you achieve just that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Insta Natural Youth Express Age Defying Moisturizer has Botanical Hyaluronic acid, Vitamin C, Vitamin B5, MSM, Cocoa Butter, Green Tea, Aloe Vera, Coconut oil, Jojoba oil, Sunflower oil, Rosehip oil, Flaxseed oil, Avocado oil, Lemongrass, Evening Primrose and more nutrients working together to give you the maximum benefits to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Insta Natural Youth Express Age Defying Moisturizer has truly impressed me and I know it will do it for you. Product is guaranteed so you have nothing to lose but wrinkles.</li>
            <li> The InstaNatural Youth Express Age Defying Moisturizer has a white color and has a cream-like texture. The scent is stronger than other serums and facial products I&#x27;ve tried but still, it smells nice. I actually like the pump which dispenses the moisturizer because it is very easy to control. I&#x27;ve been using this at night for several days now and I like that it absorbs very quickly. The texture and consistency might be a little thick but I like that it doesn&#x27;t leave any heavy feeling when I put it on. I also like that it doesn&#x27;t make my oily face oilier. It also doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t get any breakouts while using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few days and I like that my skin looks more hydrated and healthier. I haven&#x27;t seen any anti-aging effects yet (I have some fine lines on my forehead) but it works great as a moisturizer. I only need a small amount for my whole face which I think is nice because it would take a while before I finish the entire bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The InstaNatural Youth Express Age Defying Moisturizer is a great product which absorbs very quickly and works great to keep my skin moisturized and hydrated. If you don&#x27;t mind using scented facial products, then this is a nice moisturizer to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I received a free product to test and try however, all opinions are unbiased, honest and my own. No other form of compensation was received.</li>
            <li> I purchased cream this along with several other anti-aging moisturizers to find one that suited me. And this one is by far the best! This moisturizer feels amazing on my skin! I absolutely love how it makes my skin look. The seller is excellent. I am very pleased with this purchase. I encourage anyone considering this moisturizer to give it a try!</li>
            <li> This facial cream is very rich with ingredients that nourish and rejuvenate my exhausted skin. The smell is fragrance free and organic just as what&#x27;s described - it&#x27;s all natural. I appreciate the size/price and the wonderful service. It&#x27;s my privilege to give it a solid five star. Thank you.</li>
            <li> feels nice on the skin.  no greasy feeling.  no smell.  nice moisturizer overall</li>
            <li> Love this facial moisturizer. A little bit goes a long way!!! Feels great on my skin too!</li>
            <li> I recently turned 30 and have been starting to notice crows feet and other lines appearing where they hadn&#x27;t been before.  I like my appearance, but wanted to find a product that would help me maintain my skin and face so that I continue to look my age, not older!  This product is right up my alley!  It is made in the US and contains no Parabens, no Sulfates &amp; no Alcohol!!!  None of that icky, drying, damaging, bad for you stuff!  So right away I knew it was a product I would be comfortable using.  But would it work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using Insta Natural Age Defying Moisturizer Cream for a month but I have been noticing a nice difference in my skin tone and texture.  Nothing dramatic or really too noticeable to anyone besides myself, but I definitely feel like it is helping to maintain the current condition of my skin and improve it just enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while the change isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;10 years off my face!&amp;#34; dramatic, I&#x27;m happy with that.  Because I really don&#x27;t *want* to look like a 20 year old anymore.  I like looking my age, but with healthy, chemical free skin.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer! Even though I have not used it very long (about one week) the consistency and the fragrance are both great. It moisturizes my skin beautifully without feeling heavy or greasy. I have previously been afraid to use moisturizers because I thought they would break me out. However, as I am getting to an age where moisturizers are important I decided to try this one. Yay! No breakouts. My skin just feels very very smooth and comfortable after using this product. I have a lot of faith in Instanatural products. I feel their ingredients are natural and I know how to pronounce them which is always a good thing. Keep up the good work.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, sensitive skin.  This moisturizer offers the moisture I need without irritating my skin and it isn&#x27;t heavy. Love it!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this product as a tryout since I love InstaNatural Age Defining Serum so much. I wanted to find the best moisturizer from them and thought this would be it. This moisturizer does not have same wonderful smell as Age Defining Serum and rather like their SPF30, which does not smell like usual SPF at all but does not make me want to apply it at night. It is very thick and make my face a little shiny. It does give me very moist and plump like velvet skin and no acne for acne prone type skin like mine. I would recommend this product to people with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I was open-minded about this product, and endeavored to do an impartial, 4 week test. To be fair, I started the review at 3-Stars, so as to be neutral. I have no bias one way or the other regarding this product. I raised the rating to 4-Stars, based on my results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now used product for 4 weeks. My skin is a little sensitive, so I generally just apply it at night, rather than twice per day like other users. It&#x27;s very possible that twice per day application may result in greater effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my experience with this product after 4 weeks:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;♠ I notice that my skin appears more moist &amp; healthy--younger, I would say.&lt;br /&gt;♠ Product goes on very smoothly and easily.&lt;br /&gt;♠ I like the smell--a little bit like a forest (must be those roots I smell).&lt;br /&gt;♠ I apply to my face and neck, and especially on my forehead, where there are more wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;♠ I detect a slight smoothing of the wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As noted on the container, this product will make your skin more sensitive to sunlight, so one most exercise caution. I was very careful to not apply it if I will be outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;√ All in all, a good product, that did indeed provide some new life to my skin!</li>
            <li> It is heavy but not oil/greasy.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer exceeded my expectations!  I was a tad hesitant only because I&#x27;m also using a serum that contains an AHA, and it&#x27;s summer - but the serum gave me no troubles - and neither has this!  It&#x27;s so very soothing - the ingredients are great as individual ingredients, but all together are that many times better.  It&#x27;s creamy and easy to apply, a little half pump is all I need for neck and face so this will last a long time.  I appreciate the expiration dates.  The scent is very subtle, not overpowering, and dissipates once it absorbs - and it absorbs quickly leaving my skin so soft.  Yes this one is a recommended product!!</li>
            <li> I like the product how it feels in my skin, but  the odor of the cream is the one that bothers me a lot. I hope they can change the smell of it. So it could be more pleasant</li>
            <li> Love this Product also the only thing is you have to be Careful about going in the Sun while using this so I need to get a good regimen going while using this but it&#x27;s Great other than that!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using InstaNatural&#x27;s Anti-Aging Facial Moisturizer Cream for about three weeks now, and it&#x27;s made a big difference in eliminating dry skin around my eyes and forehead, as well as helping to ease irritation around my neck where I shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use about a dime&#x27;s size worth of cream on my face and neck after applying some vitamin C serum, and after 12 hours I can still feel the difference on my skin. It&#x27;s actually soft and smooth instead of dry. It also seems to help eliminate some of the puffiness under my eyes, an increasing problem as I get old(er). I&#x27;m not expecting the bags to go away completely, but I&#x27;m happy to see they aren&#x27;t as obvious as they used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also pleased with the scent, as it has an herbal/tropical-like scent that is very pleasant. Overall, this is a great way to condition and improve my skin tone with very little effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:&lt;br /&gt;Obtained From: Manufacturer&lt;br /&gt;Payment: Free</li>
            <li> This seems to really moisturize my face well.  I put it on under my makeup and have never had a problem.  Would buy this again.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it makes my skin soft and smooth. I shave every day and it leave my face dry and chaffy. I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wayne</li>
            <li> This is soooo smooth on the skin! I have been using it as a hand moisturizer, since I work with boxes a lot my hands are always dried out and cracking. I have noticed it starts working after one application, you dont normally need to put it on over and over. I needed something that would work without burning or being greasy. This is perfect for my skin, they hit the nail on the head with this organic moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Review Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
            <li> Like this cream. It does dry my skin so I mix it with a couple of drops of Argan oil during the day and a dot of coconut oil at night. I have seen some improvement in my skin tone and my skin is soft. I am a senior gal so it may not be drying to the younger gals.</li>
            <li> I was pleased when I received the chance to review this product for my blog. I have tried a few products from this company and have been pleased with all of them. This is a facial moisturizer that has a weight and thickness some were between a good hand cream and a good night cream, However it absorbs very well which makes it nice to wear morning and night.&lt;br /&gt;That being said however I tried both morning and night and found that if I used this moisturizer at night before going to bed I did not need to moisturize in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do choose to use in the morning before putting on your make up I would suggest giving about 15-20 min to make sure that the moisturizer has fully absorbed into skin before putting makeup on over it. This will help insure that there is no issues with the makeup clumping or becoming oily do to the absorption of any excess moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Nice facial moisturizer that exceeded my expectation. I had dry red spots caused by pregnancy hormones that I tried a few facial moisturizers on. There was no improvement. However, this facial moisturizer by InstaNatural made the dry spots go away and really lighten the redness. Only I notice the faint pink spots now as one normally notice his/her own imperfections. Note that the cream smells like herbal medicine and by that I don&#x27;t mean floral herbs, I mean more like Chinese medicine which smells earthy/woody. After a few days I stopped noticing the smell. Overall, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I think this product helps smooth fine lines and wrinkles, and it&#x27;s affordable!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now and here are my thoughts/experiences with it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews beforehand about the breakouts many experienced with the product and I suspect it was because they really pumped and slathered it on - so I made sure to Not do that. I used a pea size amount  (not even) on my face( one pea sized amount for the lower part of my face and another for the top part)&lt;br /&gt;I experienced no breakouts whatsoever and did see a difference - a little lightening of hyperpigmentation. Not completely gone but enough to know it&#x27;s getting better&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside of this product and perhaps it&#x27;s because of the way I used it, is that my face would get a bit dry minutes after applying (maybe it absorbed too quickly idk) regardless I used the same amount morning and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a bad cream..if you have skin that&#x27;s not so dry I recommend this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I absolutely DO NOT RECOMMEND is slathering this product on your face the same way you&#x27;d slather bbq sauce on some baby back ribs - of course your pores will be clogged and you will break out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be trying the night cream to see if I can get more long lasting moisture from using the same amount and do a review after using it for a good amount of time</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer. I&#x27;ve been using it morning and at night, I&#x27;ve noticed that my face and especially my neck is soft and fine lines are disappearing. I had that saggy neck thing going and the results are amazing. When using this I don&#x27;t need my primer. I&#x27;m also using the eye gel, which I love. I also like that natural, affordable and it gives noticeable results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many Insta Natural products and have yet to be disappointed.  Like most of the products in their product line, this one contains lots of natural and organic ingredients; many of which you would recognize.  It&#x27;s also gluten free.  In fact, the only allergen listed is tree nuts. Unlike other under-eye products I&#x27;ve tried, this one is not only for under the eyes, but also for your entire skin.  It doesn&#x27;t burn when placing it directly under my lower eyelid.  The last under-eye product I tried was a gel that felt greasy and caused a slight burning sensation for about a minute.  This cream goes on smoothly, spreads easily and does not burn.  It also has a very mild and pleasant fragrance that reminds me of freshly sliced cucumber.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 50 year old women that has tried a zillion face creams without much success.  I have VERY sensitive skin and have had breakouts all my life.  This product is a first for me as I&#x27;ve seem improvement with very limited breakouts.  The smell is a little funky upon first application.  My understanding is the company is working on this - yea -!  Cream last all day and feels great.  Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for several months now and it is great.  i love the way my skin seems to drink it in when I apply it in the morning and night.  It just seems happy when I put it on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the InstaNatural Age-Defying Moisturizer for about two weeks! I like that it can be used on your face and body because I love to use it on my hands, and Decollete. My skin feels soft, and keeps my skin feeling hydrated! The InstaNatural Age-Defying Moisturizer has an herbal scent, but it&#x27;s not too strong and fades quickly. It also absorb quickly into the skin, and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy! I really like it! I have dry skin on my body so it&#x27;s perfect, I use only a little on my face since you don&#x27;t need much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: The InstaNatural Age Defying Moisturizer was sent for review purposes. However, the opinions expressed are 100% my own based on my experience with the product.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes nicely but doesn&#x27;t make a real difference in my skin.  If all I needed was a moisturizer I&#x27;d buy again but I need a little more.</li>
            <li> I like the formula, it’s rich and creamy and absorbs quickly. I found it helped reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles on my face. I used it along with Hyaluronic Acid Serum and my acne cream. I have not had any adverse reactions by pairing the moisturizer over my acne cream and Hyalruonic Acid, which is definitely great! I&#x27;ve also been using it on my body, very versatile!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was provided a complimentary sample. All opinions are my own</li>
            <li> I really like this [[ASIN:B00KCTER3U Anti-Aging Facial Moisturizer Cream by InstaNatural]] because in my use, it has gone on smooth but best of all, no greasy after feel.  After a hot shower, my face just seems to dry out, by the end of my day it&#x27;s all oily.  I started using this product after my morning shower to help control dryness.  I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned, I apply this product just after a shower, I use two pumps from the bottle, then spread it in my hands and massage it into my face.  I use this product in combination with some of InstaNatural&#x27;s other products (Argan Oil, Rosehip Seed Oil, etc) and really like how their products complement each other for well-rounded skin and glow.  I think this product is perfect for those who are looking for more life and moisture to their skin, I have found it works great and the results seem to last much longer than other products on the market that I have tried.  I have somewhat sensitive skin and I love that this product was both gentle and didn&#x27;t cause any problems for me.  It has even helped reduce much of the oily appearance I would get in the evening and for that I am really astounded and impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Review Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
            <li> I received this cream to try out. It is said to be very good for an anti-aging cream. Now, I want to say that just because a cream has the right ingredients does not mean that it will be a magic cream and solve all of your problems. Creams need to have exceptional ingredients and need to have them in good quantities. Insta Natural Age Defying Moisturizer Cream is an okay cream but will not solve all of your problems. I say that if you are having no age difficulties at this time (meaning that if you do not have any problems then this will be okay for you). It does not seem to be a magic cream. I did not notice any difference when I used it for several weeks. They offer a guarantee so that is a good thing. The ingredients seem like they would help several things but I think this is a good moisturizer and I do think that it does a good job of keeping skin soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good product, mainly as a moisturizer and ordered this product.  I am in a remote overseas location and the environment is quite harsh so I needed a product to protect my skin.  First off, the product arrived on time, which pleased me.  This product is fragrance free but don&#x27;t let that put you off; it is because of all the natural ingredients in the formula.  After 2 weeks of using this moisturizer my skin feels soft and supple.  I am almost 60 but last week when three younger ladies in one of our sister offices thought I was 40, I knew I had it going on (smile)! The best part is that AJ contacted me twice to make sure I was happy with the product and I thought that was superb customer service.  Thank you AJ!</li>
            <li> Works better than high end brand name moisturizers for a fraction of the price!! Skin stays smooth and hydrated all day long!</li>
            <li> I got the chance to try out this fantastic Age Defying Moisturizer and I have to say it really stood up to Insta Naturals products.  I have combo skin and it’s sensitive so when I find a moisturizer that works for my skin I just have to yell it from the roof tops.  This one was a lighter moisturizer it did not leave my skin greasy at all.  It soaked right into my skin and just left it feeling softer and looking better.  If you have sensitive skin like me it is best to only use most moisturizers at night.  If you have dryer skin use it morning and night to keep your skin from drying out.  The only thing I would change about this product is the wording on the bottle.  I have pretty good eye site but the white writing on the light yellow back ground was even a little hard for me to read.  Other than that this product was fantastic.  I love the pump top.  I always hate sticking my fingers in a jar.  This product was fantastic and I could see a different in my skin after just using it for a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had the chance to try out quite a few of inst naturals products and I have loved every single one. Insta naturals has a wide range of beauty products.  For your every day needs or even for specific needs.  You are sure to find what you are looking for here.  Their prices are great and you will really get a lot for your money.  I would suggest insta naturals to everyone.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed that there was no spf...  and I don&#x27;t care for the scent .  however, the scent does not last long so that&#x27;s ok.  I will reserve judgment about how well it works for a week or two.</li>
            <li> Yep...these pumps are really crappy make, as I have seen with other reviews...so bad, because I would have give 5 star for the moisturizer...but now, that it has been adulterated and had to be scooped into another old container, I feel weird...    Anyway, overall, it feels greasy, thick and heavy at first, BUT do not despair, in about 2 minutes it absorbes perfectly into your skin and feels clean, moisturized and never greasy, perfect base for make up.  Somehow did make my skin look healthier, plumper, and cause absolutely no breakouts...I did noticed some blackheads and pores on my nose filling up so it is possible that the oils kind of accumulate, but right after using exfoliator, I was fine again...    would buy again, but PLEASE, fix those damn pumps...I cannot run back to the post office every time...and I will not like keeping defective product again!      UPDATE 12/21/14  Very sad to report that now I have stopped using the cream alltogether. I will post update if anything changes.   Reasons: As I have mentioned in my first review, I noticed this cream is very heavy, but absorbs very well. However over past weeks of using it, it seems it has completely blocked my pores, in a very sneaky, slow, invisible manner. The problems started when l found painful bumps between my eyebrows and on my temples and huge hard pores on my chin. I do not use hair products, so it is not from that. I am a picker, so tried to relieve these pores by extracting the blackheads, and exfoliating, in hopes it would relieve them, as well as aid in removing the deposits this moisturizer might leave during the day. I tried this for a while only to find more sneaky blackheads and whiteheads forming in places I would have never had this problem before. See, I have a skin that sometimes has outbreaks but not in the typical oily/teenager spots, but since I have started using this cream, the areas of no problems before have become breeding grounds for families of nasty, hardened pores. Unfortunately they are very hard, painful and almost impossible to remove without damage...I have stopped using the moisturizer and now will wait it out. I guess I might do better with a gel based moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The best thing about this cream (besides it&#x27;s awesome anti-aging ingredients) is that it comes in a pretty sizable bottle, so I don&#x27;t feel guilty using it every night not only on my face, but my neck, upper chest, and HANDS as well.  I even use it on my forearms where I have some freckles (probably sun spots or age spots).  Excellent, I will always buy this!</li>
            <li> Love this cream. It moisturizes with out making my skin feel greasy. I have sensitive skin also and this does not irritate it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product now for more than 7 days. I can say I am noticing results. Like with any new product you try it does take time. I am using this on my face and addition to on my elbows. They are very dry currently, and since I have been using this on my elbows they are not as dry. I tested this for quality and am basing my review on my experience! There is a lot of natural ingredients in this product. Jojoba oil which I have found is great for more dried patches of the skin. My skin is looking like the natural glow. I am noticing the glow on my cheeks. The moisturizer is a nice thick cream that comes out of a pump. When applied to the skin it has a cooling effect to it. I would have to say that is is to the cucumber in it. This is very natural in the products and healthy to the skin.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer lasts all day.  It has a strong scent, but not unpleasant.  I am still working on my first bottle and I am hoping the wrinkles are fading.  Will buy more...</li>
            <li> This product has a putrid odor and very sticky consistency that prevents me from rating it higher.  However it was priced well so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I can only give this 2 stars. I&#x27;ve been applying it for about 3 1/2 months now. Let me give the pros of this product are:&lt;br /&gt;It smells great- like coco/buttery &amp; earthy&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a lot of product in the bottle&lt;br /&gt;It contains a lot of good ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It is a PORE CLOGGER- This is major. I get pimples w/ this cream :(&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see it&#x27;s a magical power to reduce wrinkles. I have some smile lines around my mouth &amp; they are still there.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I&#x27;m just doubtful of the ingredients being really on this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks.  I wish that I&#x27;d taken before and after shots, because it is working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed a reduction in the crow&#x27;s feet around my eyes, as well as the &amp;#34;laugh lines&amp;#34; at the corners of my mouth are definitely not as deep.  This moisturizer feels luxurious when it goes on, it&#x27;s thick and creamy, but absorbs instantly and I don&#x27;t mind the smell at all--it&#x27;s a very very subtle, faint scent of cucumber to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the wrinkle reducing benefits,  it seems to be helping to improve my skin tone and texture, my skin is hydrated in the morning, not that combination of dry and oily like it usually is.  I highly recommend this product, and since the company offers a money back guarantee, you have absolutely nothing to lose!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** I received a sample of this product to evaluate at little or no cost, I was under no obligation to post a review or give positive feedback. I choose to review this product  in order to inform others of my experience.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best moisturizer I have ever tried. I&#x27;ve been getting compliments from the time I started using it. No dryness and I&#x27;m definitely seeing the results!</li>
            <li> I have used this as a post-shower and shave lotion.  It has served me well as it moisturizes and comforts.  I don&#x27;t know if it is defying age, but it does work very well to moisturize and prevent dryness.  I use it also in the evening.  The smell is nice when applied, and then I don&#x27;t notice it after it has been applied.  I use it around my eyes without irritation.  I am impressed with the plethora of natural ingredients.  My wife has also enjoyed using this moisturizer in her repertoire of face creams.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s now and I&#x27;ve recently been trying to get serious about anti-aging skin care.  I haven&#x27;t used many skincare products on my skin since I stopped having acne in my early 20&#x27;s.  I&#x27;ve been shopping around and trying out the most natural skin care possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this moisturizer, mostly because of what is NOT in it.  When I read the ingredients I see many natural foods and vitamins I recognize (jojoba oil, coenzyme Q10, vitamin C, etc).  I don&#x27;t feel worried about what chemicals I&#x27;m putting on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer is very thick and whipped in texture.  It feels luxurious on the skin.  In fact, it&#x27;s actually a bit heavy of a moisturizer for me right now - my skin is still rather oily in places, especially in the summer.  But I think this moisturizer will be perfect in winter when my skin is drier, and also if I just put it on the drier areas of my face, particularly around the eye area.  And as I get older and my skin loses more moisture this will be even more important to me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that my mineral powder foundation sticks to my skin so much better after applying this moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using this for a couple of weeks.  I can see minor improvement - my skin looks and feels a bit softer and maybe a bit smoother.  But I think if I keep using this long term it will help me avoid some wrinkles and signs of aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this moisturizer to anyone who prefers using the most natural products possible on their delicate skin!</li>
            <li> Good cream with light odor, not irritating for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin very moisture and smooth love it  the best</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer, my skin is very dry and the moistrization level f this product is perfect for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Caucasian woman in my late fifties and I bought this product several weeks ago because I liked the natural ingredients and hoped they would nourish my skin.  I neglected my skin until after menopause when I became distressingly aware of how rapidly I had aged.&lt;br /&gt;In the course of the past 2 yrs. I have tried numerous products and been moderately satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this cream!&lt;br /&gt;In the past several weeks fine lines and wrinkles have gradually but distinctly diminished.  But even more important and incredible is that the red, blotchy areas on my cheeks and forehead have faded until they are barely noticeable!  I no longer use cover up or foundation at all!&lt;br /&gt;Friends and family have commented on how great I look.  At the pharmacy, I was talking to another woman in line about hot flashes and she thought I was too young for menopause!  OMG!!!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only moisturizer I can get my husband to use.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month now. My main interest in this product was the claim that it was helpful for dark circles. Well, I have had a few sleep deprived months and dark circles is all I have. Whilst this product kept the area under my eyes moisturized, I did not see any improvements to the dark circles. None at all. As a moisturizer, this is excellent. The area under my eyes looks hydrated. But, it has had no effect for the dark circles. I have been using this religiously every night for a month and nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue this product until for another month and update back. Also, I don&#x27;t quite like the smell of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> This product should have a warning on the label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first week of using it I had a waitress in a club card me. \\&quot;You&#x27;re 48! Well I never!\\&quot; she says. So I droop my eyelids and say \\&quot;Honey, I have been for 30 years and I&#x27;d be honored to get you started\\&quot;. A young man&#x27;s mistake, as I felt the excruciating pain of $60 fingernails in my forearm, reminding me that I&#x27;m not single or young.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the second week, I was pulled over and told that my parents would have to be notified, I gave him the number for Shady Hills and wished him luck with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, you&#x27;re right, I&#x27;m a fisherman and we tend to embellish our stories a tiny bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But honest, this is incredibly good moisturizer. I mean, I like Neutrogena and Eucerin and Gold Bond is okay too, for my hands. But this stuff rocks. It slaps wrinkles silly and goes after dry skin like a thousand tiny jackhammers tenderizing your flesh, then it gets absorbed and your face feels like your tummy does after the second trip to the salad bar. Try and imagine that, because it reminds me of something that&#x27;s never happened before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve started using it every other day ever since I noticed a neighbor had his eye on me, he&#x27;s a truant officer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Straight talk, this is one of three Instanatural products I&#x27;ve been using and they are all good. I honestly can&#x27;t evaluate them properly because I&#x27;ve been trying them for weeks, but not just this one and so what I can quite honestly say, is that they sell tippy top of the line skin care products and that I like them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I&#x27;d like to thank Instanatural for sending me their products to try out and for their help in meeting young waitresses and for no longer needing to shave and for being able to sing the high notes once again and.........</li>
            <li> This is a great companion product to the Vitamin C Serum. In fact I would highly recommend the use of both together to achieve maximum benefit. The vitamin C content is superb and the feel and texture is on point! Many Vitamin C lotions are loaded with unnecessary ingredients and preservative and the Vitamin C still is oxidized leaving a very sad product as the end result. This facial creme is light and effective providing a powerhouse of bioavailable ingredients that you will quickly see working after just a few uses of this formula. InstaNatural has quickly become my #1 favorite cosmetic line and I recommend them to my friends, family and clients!</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with the ingredients of this product. It&#x27;s crucial what is LEFT OUT of the ingredients, as there are so many toxic ones in most moisturizers. I use this in the afternoon on my face, and it feels great. Sometimes I also use it at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan Schenck, award-winning author of The Live Food Factor: The Comprehensive Guide to the Ultimate Diet for Body, Mind, Spirit &amp; Planet&lt;br /&gt;and&lt;br /&gt;Beyond Broccoli, Creating a Biologically Balanced Diet When a Vegetarian Diet Doesn&#x27;t Work</li>
            <li> love this.  makes my skin look smooth and silky!  was worried about it being greasy (i have trouble with that) and it&#x27;s not a bit.  soaks right in.  and added bonus has this great smell that takes me back to when i was a kid (but dang it, can&#x27;t place it, lol)...for those who don&#x27;t like scents...it goes away fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> After my wife started using the Insta Natural Youth Express Age-Defying Moisturizer, she said her skin felt amazing. It is wonderful to have a face cream that doesn&#x27;t smell full of perfumes and dyes. There is very little odor at all and it is not unpleasant. It just smells natural. There is a nice thick consistency to the moisturizer that coats the skin and absorbs quickly. There is no residue or oily feeling to the skin. In addition to the product itself, the bottle used is ideal. The pump allows for just the right amount to come out so there is little to no waste. My wife uses the product every morning after her showers and says it is fantastic. She gives it a glowing recommendation and loves that because it is natural and for all skin types she can recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Let me just say this product works amazing. It is simple to apply which I normally do once in the morning and once before bed. It&#x27;s even safe to use around your eyes and does not leave an oily feeling afterwards. I have been using on my face and neck and swear I can already see a difference. This is a very affordable product which works well. I received this product an exchange for my honest review and am so glad I had the opportunity!</li>
            <li> Received this product yesterday and used it as my night cream.  When I got up this morning I could see a definite different In the appearance of my facial skin.  I looked less tired, and my skin just looked better.  I&#x27;ve decided to us this moisturizer as my day and night time moisturizer because it works that well! Highly recommended. I will definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li> l have been using it faithfully since it arrived,so far lm pleased with the early results..  thankyou for this wonderful product.  sarah Hughes</li>
            <li> InstaNatural Facial Moisterizer is a light almost whipped consistency.  A little bit does go a long way as it does not have a thick or sticky consistency so you can easily apply a thin coat on both face and neck with one application so I think it will definitely last a good long time as well. The fragrance is very light with just a hint of citrus? At any rate it did not trigger my asthma which is often a problem with fragranced lotis and moisturizers.  I recieved this on a promotional price and would purchase again. My skin felt hydrated but it does sink into your skin nicely leaving no feeling stickiness like a heavier moisterizer can and because of that I have been using this in the morning after my shower then applying my foundation over it after its absorbed and I am very happy with the results.  It is a well developed formula with the anti aging ingrediants I look for. A Plus!</li>
            <li> I am really loving the InstaNatural brand! This lotion does not feel heavy when you put it on and the scent is very light. The fact that it is 98% natural and paraben free makes me happy as well!</li>
            <li> My skin feels very soft!</li>
            <li> Really love this product works great</li>
            <li> I have to say I LOVE Amazon Prime and the 2 day shipping !!  I&#x27;m very happy with the InstaNatural Moisturizer.  It goes on very smoothly and my face feels soft all day long.  I have just started using this product so I cannot comment on the long term benefits of it&#x27;s use, but I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> The most emollient moisturizer I have used.  Thick, but not greasy.  I only use at night, as I have sensitive, acne-prone skin.  I wake with soft, smooth skin.  Has not given me any breakouts. 5 Stars once again for Instanatural!</li>
            <li> When I open the product and feel  it on my finger, it seemed to be soft and agreeable. But when I put on my face it was a little too thick and much too greasy. Everything was in surface but my skin didn&#x27;t seem hydrated or comfortable but only greasy.&lt;br /&gt;At last, I finally tried to put the InstaNatural Retinol serum  2,5%serum with 20% Vitamin C, 10% Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin E &amp; Powerfum Sik Firming Antioxidant Blend for face, Eyes &amp; Sensitive Skinwith IntaNaturak Youth Express Age Defying. But the result was worse, I fely mi skin unconfotable,dry  and I wanted to cratch it.&lt;br /&gt;My experience is not positive at all. So I would  like to know how I can give you back the product and benefit of your guarantee satisfied or money back.&lt;br /&gt;Nota : Nothing to say about communication and advice  Theses were great.</li>
            <li> This is not for me, I have tried it 2 times and it has made my face itch really bad both times.&lt;br /&gt;This is not right for my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this facial moisturizer. It makes my face feel smooth and free of oil. I have an oil face especially when I wear makeup. But the good thing about this product is that you can wear it underneath your makeup and makes your face feel refreshed. I alsonused this product as a moisturizer after I applied the eye serum under my eyes for black circles. These two are a great combination for facial cleanse. I recommend this product to any women who has an oily face and break out easily from makeup. Will continue to buy this product in the near future. Thanks again..</li>
            <li> My face has never been so smooth and vibrant!!! My only dislike about the product is that it felt a little greasy when first putting it on, but whatever it was did wonders to my skin!!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the InstaNatural products, price, and customer service. I have been using their Youth Express Age-Defying Moisturizer, Vitamin C Serum, Organic Rosehip Oil, and Argan Oil. They use good ingredients, and I feel safe using their products. The Youth Express Moisturizer keeps my skin supple, firm, and hydrated all day. It has a strong scent of natural ingredients, which I like. It is a great product, and I highly recommend it.  Also, the company is generous to their customers, and they have an exceptional customer service to boot. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I have been using it about eight weeks. My face feels softer, and it plumps up the wrinkles around my eyes so foundation goes on smoother.  I use it every morning after I apply vitamin C serum to my cleansed face.  The two products have worked well together to reduce dark spots and rough patches on my forehead.  I also like the pump bottle which helps me control the amount of product I use.  It lasts much longer that way.  The fresh herbal scent is nice too!</li>
            <li> Love it! It makes your skin feel wonderful, non greasy formula I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I use this with the InstaNatural retinal serum. I apply the serum first then this cream on top. My complexion has really improved!</li>
            <li> The ingredients list sold me: green tea, cocoa butter, cucumber and vitamins to name a few. Super moisturizing and absorbs quickly into the skin. So far I have only used this on my face but I would not hesitate to use it on any rough patches on my body. I like using this as part of my nighttime, pre-bed skin ritual. My skin feels softer and looks healthier/brighter when I wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li> Nice cream, smooth application. only use once a day for sensitive skin, but doesn&#x27;t irritate</li>
            <li> I gave this to my mom and she is loving it. She is in her 50&#x27;s and need a good anti aging moisturizer that is gentle on the skin. No harsh ingredients and safe. This is the answer. It quickly absorbs and does the job very well.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer works best for me at night. It is a thicker formula that seemed to not want to soak into my skin at first. I almost thought that I wouldn&#x27;t use it again but it quickly soaked in once I rubbed it in all the way and my skin feels fabulous. Since it is a thick moisturizer I use it at night because my makeup applied weird. The only smell that I can pick up is cocoa butter so it is a very mild smell. This is packed full of nutrient rich ingredients that are especially good and nourishing for your skin. I highly recommend this to anyone with dry skin because it definitely wouldn&#x27;t take long to knock out the dry patches.&lt;br /&gt;*I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li> Love this. No smell. Medium weight. I&#x27;ve been using it nightly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick.  It can almost be used on small areas of the body that are extremely dry.</li>
            <li> Smooth and nice rising. Just started using the product can&#x27;t wait to see the results</li>
            <li> Great stuff and I&#x27;m a vey satisfied user/customer!  Tightens my skin &amp;amp; it feels so soft!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two weeks. I have combination skin and my T-zone is very oily. This cream felt way too thick and pasty when I put it on for the first time. Then as I massaged the product on my face slowly, the cream disappeared and got absorbed. It did not feel greasy at all. The next thing I watched for was if this product would cause a breakout. It didn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t believe anything that will produce a dramatic effect. I will see how this moisture lives up to the name &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; when I am done with the bottle.</li>
            <li> Does a great job as a moisturizer.  Good product at a good price.</li>
            <li> Absorbs into skin very well. Not greasy. Smells nice.</li>
            <li> Really great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to put on my face as my skin is very sensitive.  It feels very thick too.  I put on my neck instead and there is no reaction to it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving 3 stars just because I thought I&#x27;d use on my face.  Since it feels super thick (and I&#x27;m oily, sensitive and prone to breakout) that I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll work for my face.</li>
            <li> I had previously brought Insta Natural eye serum and gel and was completly happy with the purchase, so when my serum and moisturizer ran out, I knew I had to try this. Its been 1 week since I ve started applying this and can already see the difference. My face is bright and glowing.</li>
            <li> Great quality for a good price</li>
            <li> This stuff works and works well. After one week I looked 5 yr  younger ... well never be without it!</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer. Love everything from this company so far!</li>
            <li> For a long time I have used Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair and had no complaints. I just wanted to change things up a bit, so I researched the highly rated anti-wrinkle moisturizers on Amazon and chose this for the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I have no complaints so far, except that there is not a suncreen (but that would mean unnatural ingredients).</li>
            <li> My face has never been through any rough spells until this past year. I have has so many stress related issues it&#x27;s done a number on my skin. I recently developed Bells Palsy on the right side of my face, although, it did nothing to my skin persay, it did send my stress levels through the roof. Many people will notice they will have breakouts during stressful periods in life. I am no exception, to combat the breakouts, I treat with instanatural&#x27;s vitamin c toner, which contains witch hazel and dries my face out a little bit, (which I expect with all toners) combining the toner with this moisturizer has left my complexion blemish free with no drying after effects. I love when I can find a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film, and this is it! I soaks into the skin with little rubbing effort. I have little to no trouble spots on my face that I would consider needing fixed, with continued use of this and plenty of SPF I look forward to that for many more years to come!</li>
            <li> Great, light moisturizer. Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t have the greatest smell, very earthy scent.</li>
            <li> This truly brightens your face!! Only a few weeks but really like it!!! This product was free but the review is my own opinion.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer! I use it on my face and neck, and so far I am loving it! I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks now and I think it is great.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is fabulous for so many reasons. It&#x27;s all natural, has an impressive roster of active ingredients including AHA&#x27;s and antioxidants, comes in a great pump style bottle that ensures the ingredients stay fresh and potent, and best of all it is a cosmetically elegant formula that doesn&#x27;t leave my face oily and shiny like virtually all other moisturizers I have tried (except my holy grail Cerave PM, it&#x27;s also wonderful).</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful, light weight moisturizer. Smells really good and so smooth on my face. I really like this one. *product provided for review*</li>
            <li> A very good quality moisturizer. Feels great, not too heavy or greasy for daytime use, but does the job. Great information and packaging too. A winner!</li>
            <li> Really like this cream, it goes on my face very clean. It does have a seaweed type smell to it. Not intense, but present. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I have used Clinique for years. It wasn&#x27;t absorbing into my skin. This product is amazing. It absorbs well and has changed the feel of my skin. I use this under my makeup.  I apply at night on clean skin before bed. I really like this product and the results I am now seeing.</li>
            <li> I received this cream for review purposes and used it on my body. The bottle comes with a dispenser and the cream is thick and not watery which is always a plus.The smell is fantastic and the cream itself contains healthy ingredients which I knew I can slather all over my legs and feet and thighs without worries. The great thing about this cream in my case is that I did not break out. My skin is sensitive and this cream reacted nicely to it. It moisturized without the greasy feel.</li>
            <li> This feels great on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I received Insta Natural&#x27;s Youth Express Age Defying Moisturizer.  I am always looking for a really great facial moisturizer that leaves my skin looking great.  This moisturizer feels great on.  It leaves my skin feeling soft, and looking smooth.  The moisturizer is said to help with the signs of aging.  I really like that this moisturizer is versatile.  It can be used for men or women.  It can also be used during the day, but also as a night cream.  The moisturizer also doubles as a body moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure - free sample for blog review was provided.</li>
            <li> As a part of reviewing the aragon hair  mask I was also asked if I wanted to review another product with them and I was all for it, as a woman in my early 30’s I have starting to notice the aging progressing. When they asked me to review Youth express age defying I was all for it, Anything that can help with the aging process of the fine lines and wrinkles I was willing to try anything. In the directions it says anyone over the age of 25 should have this moisturizer, I have never used a product that helped hydrate the skin like this product. Its easy to use and quite amazing, no irritation or redness. it helps not only hydrate but puts firmness back into perspective of a natural healthier looking skin. You apply it all over the face and neck , now if you have sensitive skin it advises in the directions to only use at night. Its safe to use under your eyes and under your make up. I was very pleased with the results I had with this product.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this anti- aging moisturizer for about a month now and my skin absolutely loves it. I have been getting less breakouts, my skin tone appears to be more evened out, radiant and glowing - for the first time in years I can leave the house without any foundation on and not feel embarrassed by red spots and dark circles under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is not too thick but definitely not too runny either. It&#x27;s silky smooth and very easy to apply. Most importantly, while it moisturizers amazingly, it&#x27;s not greasy at all. It absorbed quickly and leaves your skin very fresh and moist. It&#x27;s perfect for morning application under make-up, though because it contains an alpha hydroxy acid, it is strongly advised to use sunscreen while using this moisturizer in summer time (alpha hydroxy acid increases skin sensitivity to sun and may cause sunburns). That being said, I have been using it all throughout August together with a bit of sunscreen and I did not experience any skin problems or sunburns at all. You just need to be careful, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is kind of earthy/herbal. It smells a bit like cucumber and camomile. It&#x27;s not a strong a smell, and definitely not unpleasant, but it does linger for about 30-45 minutes after application. I got used to it pretty quickly, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Among other ingredients, this moisturizer contains organic beeswax, lavender, organic aloe, organic coconut oil and cocoa butter, which are all great for your skin and have anti-aging properties (coconut oil also has anti-bacterial properties and can help treat acne). This product is 98% natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is 100 ml (3.4 OZ) in the container and after using it for over a month I still have plenty to go (I&#x27;d say at least 3/4 of it left). A little goes a VERY long way. The pump is very sensitive to the touch, so you&#x27;ll never get too much product squirted out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love this product and would definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> Smells like forest woods and works well! Love the sealed and pump package too!</li>
            <li> What a great product! Very powerful anti-wrinkle cream. It works quickly to eliminate wrinkles, fine lines, crow’s feet, dark circles, and bags. It was nourishing and conditioning to my skin while making fine lines and wrinkles disappear. I am in love with the amazing results they get from using this super affordable wrinkle treatment.&lt;br /&gt;This has delivered more amazing results than any high-end department cream. I started seeing results and look younger than I ever thought possible. You’ll notice the difference after the first use! I am so glad I recieved this product for review.</li>
            <li> Smells kind of like vitamins but it works great! It keeps my dry skin very moisturized. It also leaves a nice glow on your skin. I have been using this product with the vitamin C serum and the eye cream for dark circles. The results have been amazing! I am not sure if it is the mixture or one product in particular but I can&#x27;t believe how fast this stuff works. Since I started law school my eye bags have been so dark it looks like I got hit in the face and the increased stress has caused some fine lines to appear on my face. I started using this stuff leading up to finals so my sleep levels were much lower than normal and my stress levels were way up but this magic made the dark circles disappear and the fine lines to go away too. Now I can go without makeup and people aren&#x27;t asking me if I am sick. I have tried a lot of different products but none of them have worked quite like these!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now, and am quite pleased with it! My face isn&#x27;t greasy from it, and my face feels moisturized from it. The pump is easy to use and it doesn&#x27;t make a mess. I do recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I did receive free product in order to facilitate a review of it, and the opinions expressed are my own!</li>
            <li> I really like the Age-Defying Moisturizer so far, it feels very rich and soothing to my skin and makes the skin around my eyes feel great and &amp;#34;relaxed&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s also very moisturizing to my hands and cuticles.</li>
            <li> Great Cream for the neck</li>
            <li> This is the last product I put on my face &amp; neck before bed and before I put on my make up. It&#x27;s the perfect moisturizer that lasts all day. A little goes a long way, making this a great product and a fantastic buy for my budget:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really impressed.  I took a risk here.  I&#x27;ve been using Loreal Revitalift for about 6 years.  I was unsatisfied with the price of Loreal at the store and I was all out.  So I bought this product.  I spent slightly less overall (ounce per ounce) and the product is use for BOTH day and night.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very satisfied.  After about 4 weeks, I walked passed a mirror yesterday and thought &amp;#34;Huh, I think my skin looks firmer&amp;#34; I was really surprised.  I would have been happy with status quo!&lt;br /&gt;Admittedly the first 1-2 weeks I had a few minor break outs.  (a zit here, a zit there) but that is always to be expected whenever you change product.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the smell did surprise me at first. That is, I prefer NO smell, but this has a smell. At first I thought &amp;#34;I&#x27;ll never get used to this&amp;#34; but I absolutely did after about 2 weeks...and now I sort of like it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really satisfied with the product and will probably get it again.</li>
            <li> I so far like the scent of this cream and the fact that it&#x27;s not greasy and heavy.  It does its job without obscuring my makeup application which is a major win.  I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to be able to pass judgement on the abilities of the anti-aging components, but will update my review after I have been using this for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li> 3 plus ounces at a good price rather than one ounce for a fortune. I just put some on and a little goes a long ways and it soaks in quickly with no after-burn. As to improved appearance that is permanent, I don&#x27;t expect much more than other brands that claim miracles. I just hope for some improvement on a day to day basis. I tried a free month&#x27;s sample of one of those miracle repair jobs and it actually made my face worse. So much for that brand. I&#x27;ll report long use of this product after a few month&#x27;suse. OK -- I&#x27;ve tried the whole jar and can say it is not as good as my old standard O&#x27;real Revtalift and Callogen (at night). Does not work as well and is not a very effective moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Goes on really thick and I thought I put on too much. I&#x27;m a guy with oily t-bone. This product absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t make me shiny. I&#x27;m not sure whether improved my skin after more than a month but it didn&#x27;t hurt. I will not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  Woke up to my skin looking well rested and hydrated!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for few days but it has already shown lots of improvement in the clear, clean, soft, and natural younger glowing face that was not so long ago affected by stress induced adult acne and clogged pores. I have also been using 4 other products (InstaNatural) in my routine daily (morn &amp; night) for few days longer and highly recommend ALL Of THEIR PRODUCTS based on how fast I have noticed such amazing results by using only their products (morn n night) b4 applying any make-up but have also proudly been able to go out without any make-up &amp; I&#x27;m not insecure, I love it!!! :)</li>
            <li> Thick and creamy. Absorbs nicely. Makes skin feel soft and plump.</li>
            <li> Soft subtle skin . Targets my wrinkles from doing the duck face so much</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see it much different than other creams, but it was a good price at the time.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Not greasy.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Visibly noticed smoothing of skin tones :)</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is already helping me with wrinkles and dry skin. It feels wonderful on and it does make a big difference. Thanks for high quality. I would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Seemed a little thick, but absorbs quickly.  Helps makeup go on smoothly.  My face stays moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product, but after several uses my skin started to break out all around my chin and my forehead. I have combination skin and this is not working for me even though it says its for all skin types-- I disagree completely.  This cream is pretty thick and heavy; my skin always felt oily after application. On the bright side, I guess I can use it as a hand mosturizer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this along with their Retinol serum. Overall, the product works. My skin is moisturized, and skin surface, together with the serum. Is showing real results. I took away two stars because it is just too greasy on my skin, and doesn&#x27;t quite soak in. However, the customer service is exceptional and worthy of note. I received an email checking in on my happiness with the products I purchased, and when I expressed my experience with this one they took the time to not only suggest another that might be a better fit, but to actually send me a complimentary bottle of it to try. They are serious about wanting 100% satisfaction. The replacement bottle arrived within a couple days of the email exchange. I am thoroughly impressed,  and feeling very secure in continuing to try new products from this company.</li>
            <li> Since I seriously &amp;#34;heart&amp;#34; my other InstaNatural products, I bought this to use as a night cream on my face.  Unfortunately, it was a little too rich for that purpose. The InstaNatural folks instantly gave me a refund and suggested using up the bottle as a body cream.  I tried it on my neck, an area that I had previously neglected.  Perfection!  This cream has helped restore elasticity and smoothness to my neck while reducing crepiness.  The saying goes, &amp;#34;the neck always tells&amp;#34; (age) but my neck is no longer a dead giveaway of my age thanks to this product.  I wouldn&#x27;t think of going a night without it.  One of the nicest things about this cream is its silky, creamy texture.  I think it&#x27;s the most luxurious-feeling cream I&#x27;ve tried and let&#x27;s just say I dabble a lot at Sephora. So it turns out that after my initial disappointment in this as a face cream, I will repurchase it as a neck and decollete cream for as long as InstaNatural makes it, which I hope is forever.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too early to tell, but I do like this product. It also does not seem to clog my pore or cause breakouts. I do notice my skin looks brighter and it&#x27;s only been a week.</li>
            <li> Been using this and eye serum and vitamin c serum for approx 7 weeks every day and night.  I haven&#x27;t yet noticed even the smallest affect. The ingredients seems to be very good but I just haven&#x27;t seem any improvement at all.  I&#x27;ll give the products more time though.</li>
            <li> The InstaNatural Age-defying Moisturiser has become an essential for me before I go to bed and before I apply my makeup.  I have found that this spreads evenly and takes under 10 minutes to soak in.  Sometimes I leave it a little longer before applying makeup but it depends on how much of the product I have actually used.  Just like the cellulite cream, it has a dispenser which is easy to control and it is mess free.  It has a lovely fragrance, which isn’t too overpowering for a facial moisturiser.

            <li> I just cant wait to see the end result! I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week and can already tell a difference!</li>
            <li> What I love about this moisturizer is the multi use. Especially perfect if your skin is dry or you live in a dry climate like I do. I can’t speak to the summer months of wearing it under makeup but, since you tend to wear less I would guess that you can. The Age-Defying Moisturizer is creamy, goes on smooth and hydrates your skin beautifully. On my skin it not only softened but, hydrated hand wrinkles creating a smooth non greasy look. On my face it worked great even under makeup. I&#x27;d purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  I tried this with combination of the Vitamin C Serum and it never hydrated me.&lt;br /&gt;It actually gave me 3 pimples in one week! when the last time I had pimples was probably 10+ years ago.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very dry and I had high hopes it would hydrate it, but I would wake up with my skin very dry.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing however does make me break out on my t zone, so I just avoid that area. Excellent moisturizer otherwise.</li>
            <li> I had the chance to try the Argan Oil Hair Mask and Anti-Aging Facial Moisturizer Cream. The Argan Oil can be used as a conditioner every day or once every few days. It smells so good! It makes my hair silky smooth and it seems to be a bit fuller. When I use it, my hair is completely tangle free and can be quickly combed through. This is a good product for me to use because my hair stylist said my hair was a little dry the last time I went to see her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the moisturizer before I put on my make-up. It smells like cucumbers, but is not overpowering (I’m not a big fan of cucumbers.) It has not caused me to break-out, which is a plus! As for age-defying properties, that is to be seen!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Vitamin C in my facial products, especially natural products. This moisturizer is light weight, but hydrates, and a little goes a long way. The bottle is already a generous size, so it&#x27;s well worth the money! The scent is citrusy and light. :)</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cream that safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding and this went through the test. I like that it&#x27;s full with natural ingredients and this is a huge amount of product for price.&lt;br /&gt;What really makes this cream effective is the caffeine and retinol. Yes, I know I have to be careful with retinol during pregnancy it can cause birth defects if it is present in large quantities in the blood stream. Although during breastfeeding the amount that comes from the cream and goes into my body can not go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;And for the soft skin there&#x27;s the cocoa and shea butter. Completely odor-free and it&#x27;s new to me, but good to know that there&#x27;s no fragrances that can cause allergy.</li>
            <li> I have looked for the right products for my sensitive skin.  This year, I started with InstaNatural&#x27;s eye gel, then when I reported some redness, they immediately sent me the Anti-Aging Facial Moisturizer Cream to try.  I decided to try the eye gel again.  It works beautifully without anymore issues with redness.  I was also pleased with the moisturizer cream and decided to use it in my daily routine.  I now use the day cream under my BB cream, without any problems.  What I have noticed is that even in the winter time, my skin feels soft and appears smoother unlike past winters.  Plus, the overall color and texture have improved.  As a result, I have added their Night Cream Moisturizer.  I love their products and excellent customer service provided to me.</li>
            <li> Been using it for two weeks and like it. Pores have shrunk some and face is brighter.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great product. I love that InstaNaturals products are not tested on animals and this one is 98% natural. I&#x27;m still waiting to see results but I think my face is starting to feel softer.</li>
            <li> Glides onto the skin like butter, and it provides visible results within a few weeks. Great company that provides great quality products for an affordable price. Can&#x27;t say anything better about them.</li>
            <li> Love this cream. Have only been using it along with their serum and eye cream for about one week and already see a big improvement in skin. Love it love it love it</li>
            <li> I needed to try a new moisturizer, I had tried several brands from the store and my face was still dry and itchy. I bought this based on the low price and good reviews. It is fantastic. The lotion is very thick, it feels creamy and smooth and not greasy. It soaks in quickly and my skin feels much better after. I have been using it daily for about a week and my skin no longer feels dry and flaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes in a pump bottle, and less than a pea size drop will cover your whole face. Also good for knees/elbows.</li>
            <li> I have semi-dry skin and i have been using this as a night moisterizer. I really like it . It really hydrates my face and in the morning face looks very healthy and nourished . Best thing i like about this is all the great natural ingredients it has.</li>
            <li> I love The items from Insta Natural. Why because they make their items with natural stuff! This product in particular, I have combo skin so it really helps the dry patches I have on my face. It a not greasy, it really helps with evening out t&#x3D;my complexion. It a must buy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using InstaNatural Anti-Aging for a couple weeks now and so far I like it! It has made my skin glow more than before! It&#x27;s very easy to use and within a couple weeks you will see a difference! If you&#x27;re looking for a awesome Anti-Aging product, this may be for you! I highly recommend it! Once I&#x27;ve tried it out more I will be  adding to this review and will hopefully have some pictures!</li>
            <li> I just started using it,I need to wait to see results Ihave been using the moisturizer for two weeks and I see some improvement. My wrinkles are minimized.I will purchase another bottle.</li>
            <li> I have being using the product for two weeks. I am pleased thus far. I am told that my face looks brighter.</li>
            <li> Love this company. They keep in touch after their products ship.But I was a bit disappointed in this one because it did not absorb itself into my skin. After applying it as suggested it just didn&#x27;t  seem to absorb through. I loved my serums from them and maybe this is the way it&#x27;s supposed to work, but I did not like the greasy after feeling</li>
            <li> Very nice moisturizer. Goes on smooth and silky. Also kept my skin hydrated all day. Would be nice if it had some sun protection in it. I give it 4 stars b/c it is not very fragrant. Once rubbed in the smell of the moisturizer dissapates.</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer, glad I decided to give this a try. Great price too.</li>
            <li> I used this for about a month and generally liked it but it felt a little heavy and caused me to break out.  My skin tends to be prone to break outs.  Other products from this company are fantastic and I hope to find another moisturizer to use during the day.</li>
            <li> I recently started using this product. I give a 4 out of 5 because it did what is said it would do, but nothing is 100% unless it is surgery. I would have to say the results are up there with the higher priced brands. It had dramatically reduced my wrinkles. I really like instanatural products</li>
            <li> It is nice product. But not for summer season. When I used it my face became oily.</li>
            <li> Nice and smooth moisturizing creme applied to my face, however the fragrance is not appealing to me. I&#x27;d give it 5 stars otherwise.</li>
            <li> Too thick for my face, I use it on my elbows and knees.</li>
            <li> Used this product for a couple of weeks and love it!</li>
            <li> Okay product, though a bit too thick for me. Makes a great under eye night cream. As far as the entire face, it makes my face itch. Only two stars because the pour nozzle was busted up. Unsure when this happened, but the only product I was able to use was what squirted out into the lid. I cannot get any more moisturizer out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> This is a really great moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I previously bought their vitamin C cream and had great results.  Its my nature to rhink more is better and in this case it is.&lt;br /&gt;The Age Defying Moisturizer is a little greasy but nowhere as near as bad as some of its competitors.&lt;br /&gt;The big deal here is quality and quantity.  I have a bald head so I have to cover more skin :)  Insta Natural comes in 3.4 oz bottles and are a great value compared to its competitors.</li>
            <li> I have tried several brands and I love this moisturizer!! it leaves my skin feeling soft and velvety. I will not use any other product.</li>
            <li> a teeny tiny bit goes a LONG way. Too much, and it feels a little on the heavy side, but it hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts! It&#x27;s really nice and has a very pleasant scent!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome</li>
            <li> Very nice.  Not greasy.  Blends and absorbs quickly.  Light and soft skin.  No irritants.</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful product for me, I use it in the morning and I feel my skin is soft and smooth so I go to my office with fully confidence!</li>
            <li> I am sorry but I did not see any improvement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the &amp;#34;Youth Express&amp;#34; -- as the bottle says -- with this moisturizer. The list of ingredients takes up the entire length of the bottle, but it&#x27;s good, &amp;#34;98% natural&amp;#34; stuff: organic aloe, organic sunflower oil, avocado oil, green tea, rose hip oil -- you name it, if you&#x27;ve seen it in the healthfood store, it&#x27;s probably in this moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time you use it, you&#x27;ll have to pump the lid several times to get the lotion going. The dispenser is handy, allowing you to dispense the amount you want. The moisturizer is thick and has an aroma I can only describe as &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;plant-y.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s definitely not perfumed. The moisturizer works into the skin nicely without leaving residue on the hands. I did notice, several minutes after rubbing it in, that my fingers felt so satiny-soft -- so they were moisturized too. My hands can become pretty dry so I am using this for them as well as my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer this moisturizer for winter because it&#x27;s so thick, but you could use it year-round. Recommended.</li>
            <li> New product for me....will see. I try to take good care of my Face.&lt;br /&gt;After using this product twice I can give my personal opinion, it is great!&lt;br /&gt;But what a &amp;#34;SORPRESA&amp;#34;,THAT AFTER PAYING $18.95, NOW COST OVER $100.00?!! What?! Bad news for the buyers, don&#x27;t you think Amazon?</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I just love it and so my skin, thank you</li>
            <li> I love so many things about this InstaNatural moisturizer. First it is chock full of ingredients that are proven great for the skin. InstaNatural really packed this moisturizer with the very best of the best ingredients. the list is long and you will be getting so much more with this cream that with others that only have a few things in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is 98% natural its a really rich cream and makes the skin ultra soft. I have use many creams and found this one moisturized better than I expected. The price for this is just the best with all the science and care they have put into this cream it should cost more. I love the way my skin feels after applying it .&lt;br /&gt; My skin is tight and dry but using this cream makes my face feel so refreshed and soft.I use this one on top of my serum and it works really well and dose not pill. (I really hate it when products pill) . it absorbs into the skin quickly and performs superbly. As I said I have used many many moisturizers for my face this one is just so rich and creamy its better at moisturizing that many I have tried that are so much more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;This product ships quickly and is packaged really well . I really love everything about it .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent a free sample in order to make an informed review but my opinions are my own</li>
            <li> The Anti Aging Moisturizer Cream does a good job at hydrating dry skin very well but leaves a heavy oily feeling behind in my case. I know each person&#x27;s experience will vary while it may work for some it might not work for others. I will be passing this along to my mom since I have a few problems using it.    You can read my full review on my blog by clicking the link below  [...]</li>
            <li> This facial anti-aging moisturizer is pretty instant to apply, but takes a month to finally see the difference. Great for people who sleep on their sides and have wrinkles on that certain side, and need a quicker lift away the aging on your face. Works great for smaller area&#x27;s at a time to see the difference. The smell is pretty minimal, and goes on easy, soaks in fast, and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural&#x27;s Youth Express Age-Defying Moisturizer reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles and other signs of aging as well as moisturizes your skin from deeply within. This may be used as an all around face treatment and as an under eye treatment. It also helps your skin to get better tone, complexion, brightness and that special glow that can get lost with age (or lack of sleep).&lt;br /&gt;  As far as a daily moisturizer I loved this. It is very lightweight and comes in a HUGE bottle. I like that it is all natural and leaves my skin naturally soft and not greasy. Also a little goes a long way. It is very non-irritating to my sensitive and dry skin. It also lasts for a long time I could feel my skin soft over six hours after application. My only complaint with it is it smells really bad. It reminds me of burnt leaves. Unfortunately, it is a side effect of natural products not having fragrances and like all of the natural products the smell leaves minutes after application thank goodness! However, I will say my husband tried it as well and he liked the smell of it, so perhaps this is even better for the men out there who need to moisturize. The only other disappointment I had with this is that it does not have any sunscreen or SPF protection in it and that is always a bonus for me that I try to look for in my moisturizers especially.&lt;br /&gt;  InstaNatural strive to have their customers 100% satisfied. Their logo is actually &amp;#34;we truly care about you&amp;#34;. The Youth Express Moisturizer comes in a 4.5 oz 9100ml) container. Trust me while experimenting with this and all their products a little goes a long way. The Youth Express Moisturizer is 98% Natural which is actually very good for a moisturizing cream. The majority of the ingredients are oils, vitamins and organic herb blends. It is good for two years in the bottle, they do not test on animals and they even offer a 100% money back guarantee if you are not satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Next Generation Stay At Home Mom gives InstaNatural&#x27;s Youth Express Age-Defying Moisturizer 4 Stars!ation Stay At Home Mom gives InstaNatural&#x27;s Youth Express Age-Defying Moisturizer 4 Stars!</li>
            <li> I am ALWAYS on the search for a great moisturizer that really performs well, and most of the time I am left dissappointed. Not this time though, the InstaNatural Anti-Aging Facial Moisturizer Cream is truly a product worth buying!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffer from dry skin, and I live in a part of the country where during half of the year it is very old, and the other half is very warm. So my skin goes through drastic changes throughout the year. Trying to find products to help me with my dry skin is something I am always doing. I am truly glad that I have come across this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this daily in the morning, after I have washed my face. A dime size amount is all I need to cover my face and neck area. It is a light cream that easily soaks into your skin, and leaves your face feeling so soft, smooth and hydrated. I use this under my makeup, and I never have a issue of my makeup smudging, or moving around during the day. It has become my new favorite daily moisturizer and replaced my prior cream that I was using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the anti-aging, I really cannot comment on that, I am only 25 so I am not at that stage yet, however I am sure that using this will benefit my skin in years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottle is nicely sized, and it has a great pump dispenser which gives you just the right amount of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am truly loving this product, and I am using it on a daily basis, and have nothing negative to say about it! 5 star rating from me for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> I think it should be have a little more moisturizer in it specially for dry ski people like me too lite.</li>
            <li> When I first got this product I was a little put off by the smell (reminded me of the health food store) and the consistency (very thick) but after reading the reviews I wanted to try it.  I am very glad I did!  My skin has gotten smoother and healthier looking since I&#x27;ve been using it. You only need a little bit of the product and I love that it is safe to use around your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not my favorite BUT I am loving the results enough to live with it. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about a week &amp; already my smaller wrinkles are less noticeable + my face looks smoother. The consistency is light and creamy &amp; easy to blend into your skin. I am totally pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> sorry but seen no changes</li>
            <li> I used this on my hands in the winter when they were so cracked they they would bleed everyday. After 3 days of putting this on my hands at night they were soft again!</li>
            <li> My priority is finding skin care and cosmetic products that are safe. That, and other reviews I read, prompted me to try this product. I have been very, very satisfied. I bought it a second time and look forward to seeing continued and increased benefits from long term use.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s perspective:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fair sensitive skin with a bit of rosacea on my cheeks. I&#x27;ve been trying to use more natural products for myself, but also since I&#x27;m still breast feeding my son. Everything that gets absorbed into my skin has a possible effect on him. The Youth Express moisturizer is 98% all natural. When looking at the ingredients there are still a few unpronounceable/unidentifiable ingredients in the product. Not many, but some. But it being 98% all natural, I&#x27;m not too concerned. What did bother me was that it has alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) in it. There is a caution label on the side that says AHA can increase your skin sensitivity to the sun. You should use a sunscreen when using this product. We all know that we should use sunscreen under any moisturizer. But since I have fair skin that burns easily, using a product that makes my skin more sensitive does not work well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer is thick. In the winter, I have very dry skin, so I use a thicker moisturizer. In the summer my skin gets oily in the t-zone. So I use a lighter moisturizer in the summer time. This moisturizer is too thick for my summer skin routine. I do think it would work well on my drier winter skin. In the winter, I wouldn&#x27;t mind this product having the AHA in it as much, since more time is spent in doors for us. For it being a natural product, it has a pleasant scent. It is nothing too strong or over powering. My husband complains about the scent of  Burt&#x27;s Bees hand cream that I use. I could use this moisturizer on my hands and I don&#x27;t think my husband would mind. I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles, but I can see how the thickness of this cream helps the skin plump back up to help decrease the signs of those wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some more things to make you feel good about when using this product. It&#x27;s made in the USA. It&#x27;s not tested on animals. After opening it you have 24 months to use it. Women should know how quickly makeup / beauty products should betossed. Not that we always follow those guidelines. It&#x27;s nice to know that if I have any of this product left over after the winter months, I can save it for when it gets cold again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:  Sample provided for review</li>
            <li> My wife has used this product and notes the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the Age-Defying Moisturizer for the last month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can appreciate that this product is 98% natural but I have struggled with the smell of the product.  As time has gone by, the smell has bothered me less and less but is still noticeably there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Age-Defying Moisturizer is very moisturizing together with the serum.  It seems to absorb quickly and leaves my skin smooth and firm/tight.  I do not use a full pump of the product as that seems to be a lot of product.  I have not noticed a change in my dark spots or wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I like this product because of the natural ingredient list.  I do not like the smell as it goes on as it smells like tea tree oil to me even though that is not in the product.  The smell does dissipate after 20 minutes.  It is rich and creamy, but not greasy.  I have not noticed any improvements in my skin.  I will continue to use it until it is done, but will not re-purchase.</li>
            <li> I have used several high end moiturizers over the years, and by doing some research just found Insta Natural.&lt;br /&gt;This is my second bottle ( which my husband added to a gift packcage for me knowing how much&lt;br /&gt;i loved it)&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very dry, and this moisturizer makes my skin feel supple and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;As far  as the effect on my skin this moisturizer works even better than some very expensive ones.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels hydrated for a long time!&lt;br /&gt;The only difference is that the high end moiturizers have a nice and soft fragrance,&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer has a very grassy or herbal fragrance, which can bother some people.&lt;br /&gt;I got used to it.&lt;br /&gt;As I understand, to withdraw the natural fragrance of a product you have to add some ingredients that are not&lt;br /&gt;so natural or good for you. I will try to learn more about it.&lt;br /&gt;Congratulations  to a company that kept it simple.&lt;br /&gt;by the way:&lt;br /&gt;This Company has the best customer service ever!&lt;br /&gt;I could not believe it that following my purchase I got a personal Email, explaining the company mission, thanking me for purchasing&lt;br /&gt;their product, with another Email asking if I was pleased with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I was not only buying a great product, but also felt that it matter to them whether the product was working or not for me.&lt;br /&gt;For sure I will buy it again and again from them. I can&#x27;t wait to try other products from this Company! Love the prices and product so far.&lt;br /&gt;from a ex cosmetics sales manager from a great high end cosmectic company.</li>
            <li> Yes, I do love this product.  Not so much for my face because it&#x27;s probably the most emollient moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used, and I don&#x27;t like the feel of anything heavy on my face, particularly during the summer when the humidity is high.  But on the rest of my skin?  This feels like heaven.  As I&#x27;ve gotten older my skin has gone from mixed to quite dry, and this facial moisturizer just ends the flaking and itching, just stops it dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say if there&#x27;s an anti-aging effect going on here since the only place my age shows on my skin is on my face, but if the way my skin feels after applying it is any indication, I&#x27;m getting younger by the day.  It&#x27;s a generous 3.4 oz of cream for your money, and you don&#x27;t need to apply a lot to get the bene fit.  So if you have dry skin anywhere on your body, I would say don&#x27;t hesitate to try this stuff.  You may just be happier inside your skin than you have been in a long time.</li>
            <li> I love it already!  It makes my skin look smoother under makeup.  I&#x27;m excited to see the longterm results!</li>
            <li> This seems to be a nice product, but I got a lovely case of contact dermatitis when I used it.</li>
            <li> Love the consistency and the bottle style- you get just the amount you need. This moisturizer is creamy and thick, but not too thick. Absorbs so well after using the Facial Cleansing Oil.  The company sent me a personal email to ask about my satisfaction, and then responded to a question!  Great service.</li>
            <li> Love this! Arrived quickly, made my skin feel great, and didn&#x27;t cause irritation.</li>
            <li> &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3 ;)This product Increases elasticity, firms and plumps my skin around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;It hydrated my delicate eye area I can definitely feel the difference.&lt;br /&gt;It Useful for the entire face. It can be applied all over my face for an enhanced glow and a more radiant looking face. I love how my face was very nice and pleasant after I used this and the great thing about this product it does not dry out you&#x27;re face like some products I used in the past. It 5 stars for me. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I was a little unsure about using this product. I&#x27;m usually sensitive to things with AHA but this product has been really nice. Absorbs well, has an herbal scent but I like it. Not noticed yet if there is any improvement to my face but I&#x27;ve used it on my hands and I think they&#x27;re looking better from the use.</li>
            <li> This is the best. Works phenomenally.  Not a fan of the slight rose odor, but works so well who cares. Results are pretty quick. Goes on smooth and does not irritate my sensitive skin.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Excellent facial moisturizer! Easy to control w/the pump to get just as much as you need, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I love love this Moisturizer. It has restored life to my skin. I don&#x27;t use this on my face because it&#x27;s too much for my face but on my body it is perfection. It removes dead skin cells and works to protect the skin providing moisture and nourishment to the skin creating a softer texture and ultimately clearer skin. I don&#x27;t recommend for the face but the body as it works great. It has AHA so it is important to protect  your skin with a sunscreen when using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was sent this product to try out and review. I have written a more detailed review on my blog thebeautyanalytic.blogspot.com</li>
            <li> I was very impressed.  Great moisturizer.. Not greasy!</li>
            <li> Feels great on my face! Leaves a clean feeling on my face!  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for 7 days now and I really like it.  I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny and their customer service is top notch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting instaNatural products to try for review &amp; I love them, will keep using as I can see results already!</li>
            <li> I like this product. I tend to have dry skin on some parts of my face and this product does not leave my face oily.  Very light weight.  Although it says no scent, to me it had this small scent that was not to my liking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already noticing results within less than a week.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd InstaNatural product and as with the others I absolutely love it.  This is a rich but easily absorbed and non greasy moisturizer in a convenient pump container. I have 40 year old skin that is prone to break outs so I was concerned about using a rich product but this brand of skin care seems to contain ingredients that just don&#x27;t aggrivate your skin at all. I have noticed a definite softening of my forehead lines but the best improvement had been my neck. This bottle is large enough and contains enough moisturizer that you can easily use it on your face, neck, shoulders, chest and hands and not feel like you are draining your supply super fast. It&#x27;s another hit for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this each night for a short time &amp; I have already noticed my skin improving a ton. It is a very nice quality cream.&lt;br /&gt;I will order it again soon.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;effective&amp;#34; this anti-aging moisturizer is yet,but I&#x27;m having a hell of a time blending this thing on my face!!! :-/</li>
            <li> really good moisturizer. Doesn&#x27;t leave skin oily but is still moisturizer. Great as a day and night cream</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  It has certainly helped my face and neck area. It seems to be clearing up all of my problems. Thank you for making this product.I  received it for free</li>
            <li> I use 5 drops per night on freshly washed face. I let it soak in for a few hours and then put moisturizer over it. Seems like it brightens and reduces dark spots on my face. And it helped Reduce some fine lines on my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this company and their amazing products.  If you want to feel younger and look beautiful without breaking the bank InstaNatural is for you.  The natural, effective, non-abrasive ingredients make it worth trying.  You will &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; the results instantly.  Skin looks plumper, smoother, and is a good base for your makeup.  I don&#x27;t leave home without it!</li>
            <li> InstaNatural Anti-Aging Facial Moisturizer Cream has many ingredients that provides nutrients to the skin, Vitamin C, Hyaluronic Acid, Vit. B5, MSM etc. I like the fact that it is natural and contains no parabens, sulfates and alcohol. It is creamy in nature but absorbs quickly and doesn’t feel heavy on my face. It provides the much needed hydration to skin. I use it on my hands as well and find that skin on my hands is no more dry after the long winter. The pump is easy to use and you don’t need a lot. It has made my skin hydrated and supple. I’ll continue to use it. It comes with a lifetime money back guarantee so you have nothing to lose.</li>
            <li> I like the product and how it works but it smells terrible.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  At 51, I don&#x27;t expect miracles, but this comes close.  My skin is softer, brighter, more supple, and fine lines have faded.  A bonus of this product is that I use less than I did when using the more expensive name brands - and I get better results.</li>
            <li> I like the product. I like the way it feels on my skin and how well it soaks in without being greasy! It&#x27;s terrific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as much as I try, I can not get over the smell. It&#x27;s not pleasant like other moisturizing lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a matter of fact, it&#x27;s offensive. I&#x27;ve tried for several weeks to get used to it because I like the product! It&#x27;s really a shame because it us one of the top products I&#x27;ve tried *and I&#x27;ve tried a lot over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truly hydrates older skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t love the smell but it feels nice on my face. haven&#x27;t  seen any difference but I&#x27;m hoping it does help</li>
            <li> Only reason I gave it five stars it because I haven&#x27;t had enough time to really give it a thorough review. After my first application, I did notice that my skin felt more hydrated. As far as the circles and puffiness of my eyes, I cannot tell whether it is really working to reduce that yet.</li>
            <li> I wanted to give this stuff some time to show its worthiness.  It has an unpleasant odor.  It is the same with many things that are &amp;#34;unscented.&amp;#34;  Unscented does not mean odorless.  Unscented means that they did not add a pleasant smell, so you get whatever the components smell like.  It goes on white like zinc oxide, but rubs in quickly.  It does not leave the skin feeling oily even in the oily areas.  It seems to work as well as the more expensive moisturizer that I used before.  However I have not used it in warm weather yet, and that is often the real test.  Overall my skin looks more even and feels somewhat better compared to just a moisturizer.  At this point I am continuing to use the product.</li>
            <li> My skin is looking a lot younger since this product. My wrinkles are looking less noticeable. This is somethng that I will be continuing to use for a long time.</li>
            <li> I am really liking this moisturizer. I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy as a lot of moisturizers do.  I also really, really like the scent and lets face it, when something on you face has a scent, you want it to be a pleasant one.  I have noticed that the &amp;#34;crow&#x27;s feet&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;laugh lines&amp;#34; as well as the wrinkles in my forehead are definitely less prominent, so I&#x27;m happy :)</li>
            <li> Excellent facial moisturizer.  Many products either irritate my skin, or leave it very oily.  This products works well for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several products from InstaNatural and love them all. This moisturizer absorbs quickly and never feels greasy or heavy. It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or make my skin breakout as some other moisturizers have. I live in AZ - a very dry, desert climate and I really need a moisturizer that works. This product does an amazing job of keeping my skin soft and hydrated. And I love the scent - very fresh and light.</li>
            <li> I really love this new product line from InstaNaturals. The creams are light and go on easily. They absorb quickly with no sticky feeling. The day cream works great under makeup.</li>
            <li> I am SO picky about my facial moisturizer and I finally found one I love!  This is very good quality (which is a big deal) and not full of chemicals (even bigger deal to me)!  My hunt for facial moisturizer is over!!  My face is so soft and feels amazing!  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Right up-front, great product, will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Liked this product, it felt clean and not greasy. I cant see a difference, but if definitely feels a bit firmer and fresher. I absolutely love the feel of the aloe gel in this product.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive and dry skin.  This moisturizer is great.  My skin is hydrated and less red than it was before I started using it.</li>
            <li> Like this cream. I wear it almost everyday after I clean my face. It makes my skin feel really soft and not oily. A great base before putting on my makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month.  It is not a bad moisturizer but it has a strong smell.  It takes a while to get used to.</li>
            <li> I love love love anything made by instanaturals. This is a high quality moisturizer. I use it for my oily skin and it makes my skin feel great!</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer. Very emollient and makes my skin feel great. Also, you use very little wach time!</li>
            <li> I really do love this product. It&#x27;s my 3rd or 4th bottle. It reminds me Nerium. (A much more expensive product that requires you to join a pyramid to purchace.) I pair this with the InstaNatural Vitamin C 20% Serum (blue bottle). The serum is in a dropper bottle so I put the drops on the back of my hand as a holding place to dip my finger before dabbing it around my eyes. One day I looked down and realized how great my left hand looked compared to my right! Now I put the serum and the lotion on both my hands and they love me for it! Great products!</li>
            <li> I have been using this everyday for b 3 weeks, now and am quite impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> This facial moisturizer is great. when you use hyaluronic acid products, you should follow with a good moisturizer. This fits the bill. Now, I have a complete set of this line that I am very pleased with. They also make a body moisturizer that is great on your heels.</li>
            <li> I started using this product several months ago and I have really come to like it. At first, the product smells very funky- I can&#x27;t quite describe it. I guess the best way would to say that it smells very &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and takes some time to get used to. When I put this on my face (I combine it with the 100% Rosehip Seed Oil, my face feels extremely moisturized! My skin has that glow that I&#x27;ve never had from any sort of moisturizer I&#x27;ve used in the past. I feel this moisturizer really does what it says it will! I will definitely be purchasing this moisturizer when I run out!&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Big size- 3.4 oz&lt;br /&gt;2. Natural&lt;br /&gt;3. leaves my skin glowing and very moisturized&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Smell- has a very &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; smell which I have found very hard to get used to</li>
            <li> This cream does not irritate my sensitive skin, even used morning and night.  It hydrates very well, fine lines disappear and deeper forehead lines are greatly minimized almost immediately after application.  Powder make-up goes on well over it.  Very impressed with it!</li>
            <li> I have bought two bottles so far.  I have very sensitive skin.  I LOVE THIS CREAM.  Absorbs fast.  Skin is starting to look more youthful.  Good Value for your money.</li>
            <li> I like this company&#x27;s products and use the Hyaluronic Acid Serum.  I wanted a light moisturizer cream so I purchased this product.&lt;br /&gt;It was thicker than I anticipated but went into the skin nicely.  However, I did not care for the smell.  Too fragrant for me.  For a natural product, it had a cheap, dollar store lotion smell.  I give them 3 stars for the easy, no-hassle returns.  If they have an alternative lotion, I&#x27;d try it.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer it is thick and soaks into your skin quickly and leaves it moist not greasy, bought two more, one for my mom and one for my sister.</li>
            <li> It works okay, but has a weird odor.</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer in combination with InstaNatural&#x27;s Vitamin C Toner and their Vitamin C Serum with 20% Hyaluronic Acid Serum and really enjoy using all 3 products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;InstaNatural uses all or almost all natural ingredients and you can tell the difference.  Their products either have no scent or rely on the natural ingredients for fragrance.  This moisturizer contains cocoa butter and smells lightly of cocoa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is a bit thicker than other facial moisturizers I have used but absorbs really well and absolutely does not leave a greasy or oily residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is supposed to help with texture and tone of skin. I don&#x27;t feel like it has clogged my pores and leaves my skin feeling well hydrated.  It is thick and effective enough to be used as an under eye cream and this is the area where I have noticed the best result without having to use a separate product which I appreciate.</li>
            <li> I have been searching FOREVER for a great moisturizer. My skin during winter gets soo dry I am so glad to have been able to test this product its amazing. I dont think I would recommend this product for oily skin but dry skin for sure. It is thick and has great coverage and sinks into your skin fast. My skin feels so hydrated and moisturized!  Lets face it, dry skin and makeup together do not go!</li>
            <li> Nice product, made skin feel very good</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this for the anti-aging properties, but unfortunately I was never able to use it on my face long enough to find out how well it worked for that. After using it the first couple of times, I had a major breakout. Not fun. Maybe that is because I have sensitive skin, but that alone will keep me from using this again on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the problems on my face, it does work well as a moisturizer on my elbows and knees, which both tend to get pretty dry. However, I couldn&#x27;t get over the smell. I just couldn&#x27;t stand the smell. To me, it smells like a mixture of cocoa powder and cucumber. While these scents are fine separately, the combination was unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this might work really well for some people, it just isn&#x27;t for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample for review. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I bought for my mom in 70 years old. She has used it for several months. I can see her skin look more smoother, winkles and dark spots become lighter. This product works well for her very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This rich cream is better suited for body applications, rather than the face, unless the facial skin is extremely dry.  It&#x27;s a relatively heavy cream that is loaded with cocoa butter (as can be detected from the smell of the product).  It&#x27;s a good after-shower body lotion and the scent is nice.  Overall a good cream but wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; at all.</li>
            <li> I have used the InstaNatural Age-Defying Moisturizer before going to bed on my face and the next morning I wake up to softer feeling skin. My complexion looks moisturized and glowing. I have an oily skin type and it is hard to find moisturizers that won&#x27;t make my skin be more oily. A little drop is enough for the whole face for this skin type. I have not had any bad skin reactions from this yet. I would recommend this to be used at night because if you forget to put on sunscreen in the daytime, there are ingredients in this that can make you get sunburned or tanned easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When applying it on the body, this absorbs quickly into the skin. The scent is not overpowering at all. My hands and legs feel soft and not sticky. It feels very light and not thick like most body lotions.</li>
            <li> This works great in the mornings.  I put one pump of this in the palm of my hand, then add 2-3 squirts of InstaNatural&#x27;s Rose Hip Oil, mix it together and apply.  It works in good and I intend to continue using it.  This has replaced my daily use of retinol entirely.  I recommend InstaNatural&#x27;s Night Cream has well, coupled with the Rose Hip Oil at night before bed.</li>
            <li> Thick heavy cream. Smells terrific! I have very oily skin, reading moisturizer would help. Didn&#x27;t work for me. Applied to T zone area created flood of oil. Applied to cheeks an throat is amazing. Doesn&#x27;t keep eye area moisturizer after 4-6 hours. Very nice moisturizer just not for my skin type.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t moisturize very well, and the smell was unpleasant to me. My skin feels like I applied wax to it.  I put some on as I was writing this and can&#x27;t wait to wash it off.  What is the smell?</li>
            <li> Overall I really like this moisturizer. I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell but I checked the ingredients and there is no fragrance added so it&#x27;s just the natural smell of the ingredients which I can deal with. I hate perfume. It goes on a tiny bit greasy but gets absorbed quickly. I think the reason is that it is not water based, which is a good thing. What I love about it is that it makes my face look and feel very soft and smooth. It gives my skin a matte look, not shiny. I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week, but so far I have to say that it is one of the best moisturizers I&#x27;ve used in a while. It lasts all day. Let&#x27;s see if it can make me look younger!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer evens out your skin tone by diminishing the presence of age spots, sunspots, scars, and other discoloration. My complexion was left looking bright and radiant, with a smoother feel. I can&#x27;t attest to any age-defying attributes, since I have never had wrinkles(and hopefully won&#x27;t any time soon) to compare before and after.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin nice and moisturizer. Love this product would recommend to all my family and friends.</li>
            <li> Very thick and heavy, but I really enjoy it at night or on my hands.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot. Doesn&#x27;t irritate or aggravate my sensitive skin. Great purchase!! I&#x27;d purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This lotion goes on smooth &amp;</li>
            <li> Seriously LOVE the way my skin feels and looks. My skin tone is even and looks amazing. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great product works excellent.</li>
            <li> I had to give this product a chance before I posted a review.  I ordered this product in early November...and find that I need to reorder now.  It lasted a full 4 months.  I think this moisturizer is fantastic!  I use it on my neck area daily and have noticed a dramatic difference in the color and smoothness of my neck.  I am in my late 40s, and received many compliments that I look like I am in my early 30s. I owe that partially to this product...since I do not seem to be developing &amp;#34;turkey neck&amp;#34;. :)</li>
            <li> Works like a charm! I love this cream. I will be buying again!</li>
            <li> I started using InstaNatural products this year and I honestly cannot be happier with them. I will be turning 40 this year and when I tell people my age they are astounded! People think I am in my late 20&#x27;s and never get guessed for anything over early 30&#x27;s! I started seeing some fine lines around my eyes and wrinkling that I wasn&#x27;t happy about, and this product along with other InstaNatural creams have really turned things around for my face. This moisturizer is perfect for an AM routine because it absorbs quickly, is non-greasy, and you can put your makeup on right after it. I love that it comes in a pump bottle so I&#x27;m not having to dip my fingers in and contaminate my product. Also, the pump protects the active ingredients from light and oxidation. My skin is hydrated, soft and supple, and just radiant from within.</li>
            <li> I like this product. It hydrates my skin without making it oily and I do not break out! Winter was harsh on my skin, this ream is really helping me.</li>
            <li> Super moisturizer, my husband loves it</li>
    </ol>
