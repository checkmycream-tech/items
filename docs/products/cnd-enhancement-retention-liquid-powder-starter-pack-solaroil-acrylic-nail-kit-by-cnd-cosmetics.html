            <li>I love the quality of this acrylic.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>Great size powder, it will last a good bit.</li>
            <li>Just waiting on the top coat to arrive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to keep a set of nails on until these.</li>
            <li>Was so excited to get this, and I love it.</li>
            <li>it is easy to spread, holds strong, and doesn&#x27;t chip.  </li>
            <li>However, the product worked fine.</li>
            <li>I love how quickly I got this product and enjoy the whole set.  </li>
            <li>Overall a good kit to start with</li>
            <li>so they will last a good while</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never been able to get the monomer/powder ratio right with the cheapo acrylics, but I did pretty well with this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and the colors are pretty.</li>
            <li>I did not realize that the high gloss top coat did not come with it.</li>
            <li>but they are decent size, and they also included files!!!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t done acrylics in a long time and I decided I wanted to do my own.</li>
            <li>Every product in it is exactly as I would have hoped.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase more.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t last very long,but the kit is nice and the colors are very natural for the pinks and whites.</li>
            <li>I really like this kit.</li>
            <li>and I really like it</li>
            <li>But a helpful hint that has nothing to do with the product, is if whatever top coat you decide to put over the nail, starts yellowing, then simply take off your clear coat and put on a new one.</li>
            <li>Happy to help, because I am also skeptical when buying online.</li>
            <li>it is the clear coat</li>
            <li>It has nearly everything you need to get started with acrylics.  </li>
            <li>Only ended up using the powders and acrylic liquid but pretty big bottles</li>
            <li>Same as the clear that I ordered separately.</li>
            <li>Make sure you buy some false nails separate and also get a nail primer.</li>

            <li> This is the best for doing your own Acrylic nails at home. Great size powder, it will last a good bit.</li>
            <li> This is a small package. It was a lot smaller then I thought It would be. But the White and Pink powder are .8 Oz. Same as the clear that I ordered separately.</li>
            <li> This is a great set.  It has nearly everything you need to get started with acrylics.

            <li> I was invoiced, as advertised, for $47.99 plus tax ..... However, the CND Retention+ Starter Pack arrived with one of those common orange stickers marked $36.25.  That is an $11.74 difference from advertised price.  I am rating one star for unfair before-tax base price discrepancy of a sizable amount -- nearly $12.</li>
            <li> Only ended up using the powders and acrylic liquid but pretty big bottles so they will last a good while</li>
            <li> Was so excited to get this, and I love it. The stuff is all medium sized - not too small, not too much. The nails after finishing them look great, and the wear on the nails is also great. The kit will definitely last me awhile. Will definitely be buying this brand again. But a helpful hint that has nothing to do with the product, is if whatever top coat you decide to put over the nail, starts yellowing, then simply take off your clear coat and put on a new one. It&#x27;s not actually the white powder that yellows it is the clear coat the becomes dirty. Ask me any other questions you have about the product! Happy to help, because I am also skeptical when buying online.</li>
            <li> Just got it and haven&#x27;t used it as of yet. Hope I can get the hang of doing my own nails.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality product. It&#x27;s easy to apply and the colors are pretty.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful to work with.</li>
            <li> I did not realize that the high gloss top coat did not come with it. However, the product worked fine. Just waiting on the top coat to arrive.</li>
            <li> What a difference.  They actually stay on longer, look nicer.</li>
            <li> Most perfect acrylic system ever. I have been doing nails for 22 years. I have seen cnd but often skipped due to the price. Man why did I do that, there is NO lifting and it goes on effortlessly plus you have time to mold and sculpt it!  I will definitely purchase more.</li>
            <li> best product on the market. Great for beginners to masters. Nails are flawless every application with no lifting or breaking. I&#x27;ve never been able to keep a set of nails on until these. I will always be a CND customer!</li>
