            <li>great product looks NATURAL easy to spray oN love</li>
            <li>Great spray tan for in between professional spray tans.</li>
            <li>Which hello is SO important, I can&#x27;t tell you how many sunless tanning products I&#x27;ve used where the mist comes out chopping or dotty.</li>
            <li>It looks like you have a true tan from the sun!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m Italian with a fairly Olive Complexion and this stuff makes me GLOW!</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>but if you shower, exfoliate and spray (on tile floor for easy</li>
            <li>Perfect hue for my light skin and easy to apply with minimal lines.</li>
            <li>Step in shower and spray lightly about arm&#x27;s length away from face.  </li>
            <li>go out to California Tan for making such a great product.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff so much I bought 3 more bottles.</li>
            <li>The spray comes out quick but evenly, which is nice because if you&#x27;re doing your whole body it takes like 3 minutes!</li>
            <li>Much appreciated!!!</li>
            <li>I own every single product their is, and I absolutely love this one!</li>
            <li>I like that it doesn&#x27;t come out too dark (since I&#x27;m very fair skinned) and is buildable.  </li>
            <li>I can live with it since I get such great color!</li>
            <li>The California Tan sprays on evenly leaving your skin golden brown!</li>
            <li>The color is wonderful, no more orange.  </li>
            <li>My complexion is fair with pink undertones and this product appears more orange on me than the Designer Skin product line.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful bronze tan in 4 hours or less.</li>
            <li>It builds gradually to a very nice bronze glow-- not orange and not too pink.</li>
            <li>QUICKLY  </li>
            <li>Out of everything i&#x27;ve tried this one produces the most realistic tan I&#x27;ve seen though.</li>
            <li>Product was received quickly and containers were sealed.  </li>
            <li>Try Fake Bake Flawless :)</li>
            <li>My favorite so far!</li>
            <li>Lastly, i&#x27;m not crazy for the bronzer in the product.</li>
            <li>Another thing I really liked is that the smell isn&#x27;t gross, its like a floral type smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;M ADDICTED UNTIL I FIND BETTER!!!</li>
            <li>I ended up hopping in the shower right after putting it on.</li>
            <li>The color is great and there is very little smell.</li>
            <li>And the one full body application took almost the whole bottle.</li>
            <li>I was reallllly leary about buying this online, but when it arrived (super fast) It was sealed</li>
            <li>Looks fantastic and natural and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it is designed to do</li>
            <li>This is significantly cheaper with the same results and I love the locking mechanism on the lid!&lt;br /&gt;CON: it does have a floral old perfume smell.</li>
            <li>Sprays nice and even...leaves even tan did not turn orange or any other color</li>
            <li>All my friends kept asking  me how do I find time to go to the beach and get such a nice looking tan on my busy schedule.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This tan has a wide constant spray and a very nice scent.  </li>
            <li>make sure to put a towel down first!</li>
            <li>The develop time is also nice only 4 hours instead of the usual 6-8 for most sunless products.</li>
            <li>this product and brand is amazing , a must have for tanners and fake tanners, everyone need this product, I love the color and the smell</li>
            <li>The thing I really didn&#x27;t like was that it drips a lot while spraying, causing you to rub it in, leaving streaks and stained hands.  </li>
            <li>The whole reason I bought a spray one was to avoid these problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had to wash my WHOLE bathroom after using this.</li>
            <li>All in all I really enjoy and like this product, I have already purchased 4 cans over the last 3 months.</li>
            <li>Comes out to fast for control..</li>
            <li>Gives you an instant natural healthy looking tan that last about 4-7 days.  </li>
            <li>The only suggestion I have for purcasers is to put it on right after you have showered and exfoliated.</li>
            <li>I kept trying to convince everyone that orange was the new tan, but they weren&#x27;t buying it.  </li>
            <li>I am from New Jersey and tanning</li>
            <li>the color can&#x27;t live my house with out it</li>
            <li>..tons of compliments on tan very very natural looking</li>
            <li>Looks just like a natural tan!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the exact same</li>
            <li>Very very messy, you&#x27;ll need to clean your whole bathroom after use.</li>
            <li>AS FAR AS SELF&lt;br /&gt;SPRAY</li>
            <li>BUT AS FAR AS OVERALL&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I had my old bottle of CTan that I bought from my tanning</li>
            <li>Spray directly on the glove and rub into the areas you want to tan.  </li>
            <li>The smell is okay, feels a little goopy, and takes longer then normal to dry.</li>
            <li>you decide to try it, make sure you let it dry for a few hours and then take a shower otherwise it will stain your clothes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it does not have that typical \\&quot;spray tan\\&quot; scent that is associated with most other products.</li>
            <li>and I still have at least two more applications left.</li>
            <li>Dark but VERY streaky!</li>
            <li>Be careful because the spray does come out fast.</li>
            <li>I even put down two towels first.</li>
            <li>Will streak and run which leaves darker areas if not very careful.  </li>
            <li>Wish they came out with a bronzer free version just because it gets a little messy.</li>

            <li> and I had my old bottle of CTan that I bought from my tanning</li>
            <li> Spray directly on the glove and rub into the areas you want to tan.  </li>
            <li> The smell is okay, feels a little goopy, and takes longer then normal to dry.</li>
            <li> you decide to try it, make sure you let it dry for a few hours and then take a shower otherwise it will stain your clothes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it does not have that typical \\&quot;spray tan\\&quot; scent that is associated with most other products.</li>
            <li> and I still have at least two more applications left.</li>
            <li> Dark but VERY streaky!</li>
            <li> Be careful because the spray does come out fast.</li>
            <li> I even put down two towels first.</li>
            <li> Will streak and run which leaves darker areas if not very careful.  </li>
            <li> Wish they came out with a bronzer free version just because it gets a little messy.</li>
            <li> I have long given up baking in the sun or using the tanning beds.  </li>
            <li> Also lasts just as long if not longer than a spray tan from the salon.</li>
            <li> The color is similar to a spray tan at the salon, so not a super fake/orange color.</li>
            <li> Looks super fake and orange.</li>
            <li> However, at least it too comes out looking natural.</li>
            <li> Only thing, they may need to work on, is it can get a bit drippy or messy-</li>
            <li> Uneven, still damp a half hour later.  </li>
            <li> I use it every other day two days.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product over other brands!</li>
            <li> (that misses the tan for some odd reason) and then after about 5 minutes I pat myself down with a towel</li>
            <li> Messy and way too dark.</li>
            <li> I would also recommend not using this product on carpeted areas as the spray will travel to the ground and make a mess.</li>
            <li> I had been a Fake Bake user and wanted to try something new and regret it.</li>
            <li> Plus, it has little to no tanner smell.</li>
            <li> Wash my face, put a little lotion on my eyebrows so they don&#x27;t absorb the color.  </li>
            <li> The color is alright, a little orangy for my liking but it does the trick.</li>
            <li> Just spraying is difficult to keep a natural look.  </li>
            <li> If you spray too close it runs and coats unevenly.</li>
            <li> Let dry&lt;br /&gt;a few minutes and go to bed.  </li>
            <li> To those of you that think this is messy, let me offer a suggestion.  </li>
            <li> This spray goes on evenly and will give you an immediate bronze glow which progresses over a few hours after application.</li>
            <li> Yes it has overspray and yes it still smells like fake tanner (they all do), but as far as ease of application, price and evenness of color go, this one takes the cake.</li>
            <li> No more mess.  </li>
            <li> definitely would recommend over fake and bake spray products.</li>
            <li> California Tan and Fake Bake cost about the same.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also VERY messy.</li>
            <li> The distribution just sucks really bad haha.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m VERY pale, and always receive compliments about my &amp;#34;beautiful tan&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Which you do get the usual sunless tanning smell after the product has sat on your skin to process its not really that bad.</li>
            <li> the bronzer is messy, and the smell still smells like that fake tanner smell.</li>
            <li> Oh and did I mention you get at least 3-4 applications out of each can?!?</li>
            <li> Now I no longer have to keep up that charade (it was getting exhausting).  </li>
            <li> I stay away from FAKE BAKE because it&#x27;s so unhealthy-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try Fake Bake, from what I hear</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Fake Bake fan.</li>
            <li> Get Fake Bake instead.</li>
            <li> This product is impossible for getting an even tan.</li>
            <li> Give it a try, you will not be disappointed in this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The color comes out great, and it smells good.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t come out too dark (since I&#x27;m very fair skinned) and is buildable.  It lasts for about 5 days.  The thing I really didn&#x27;t like was that it drips a lot while spraying, causing you to rub it in, leaving streaks and stained hands.  The whole reason I bought a spray one was to avoid these problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you decide to try it, make sure you let it dry for a few hours and then take a shower otherwise it will stain your clothes.&lt;br /&gt;I honestly think there has to be a better product out there. I&#x27;m going to try Fake Bake, from what I hear it&#x27;s really good.</li>
            <li> I bought this from a local tanning salon.  It works great but you must blend with your hands. Just spraying is difficult to keep a natural look.  I have had many complements on my color.</li>
            <li> I get Mystic sprays weekly &amp; this is a great touch up...make sure to put a towel down first!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the rich color!  I won&#x27; use designer skin tan in a can anymore!  This is significantly cheaper with the same results and I love the locking mechanism on the lid!&lt;br /&gt;CON: it does have a floral old perfume smell. I can live with it since I get such great color!</li>
            <li> Looks just like a natural tan!</li>
            <li> keeps the skin cancer away, what more can I ask for</li>
            <li> Uneven, still damp a half hour later.  Orangey on me.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT BUT YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING AS FAR AS SELF&lt;br /&gt;SPRAY TAN.  MAKE SURE AREA 5 FEET AROUND YOU IS PROTECTED.  BUT AS FAR AS OVERALL&lt;br /&gt;FINAL RESULTS ITS THE BEST I&#x27;VE FOUND FOR AT HOME USE AND IVE USED MANY.  ITS&lt;br /&gt;SHIPPED QUICKLY  MY QUESTION IS TO SELLERS  \\&quot;IF I BUY 12 DO I GET A DISCOUNT\\&quot; BECAUSE&lt;br /&gt;AT 18 BUCKS ITS STILL PRICEY  BOTTOM LINE GREAT PRODUCT  I&#x27;M A BALLROOM DANCER AND&lt;br /&gt;FAT LOOKS BETTER TAN.  NO MATTER WHAT!!!  I&#x27;M ADDICTED UNTIL I FIND BETTER!!!</li>
            <li> This is about the 6th spray on tanner I&#x27;ve used. Out of everything i&#x27;ve tried this one produces the most realistic tan I&#x27;ve seen though. Lots of bang for the buck too ie more DHA. Plus, it has little to no tanner smell. Lastly, i&#x27;m not crazy for the bronzer in the product. Wish they came out with a bronzer free version just because it gets a little messy. However, at least it too comes out looking natural.</li>
            <li> Great spray tan for in between professional spray tans.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is designed to do</li>
            <li> Easy to use a good product for fast results!</li>
            <li> Dark but VERY streaky!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite spray tan product! The color is perfect and sprays light not heavy and runny like a lot of the others on the market. I would recommend this to anyone! I&#x27;m VERY pale, and always receive compliments about my &amp;#34;beautiful tan&amp;#34; :) everyone assumes was achieved with a tanning bed. LOL! No orangie color, lasts 7+ days depends on how well you take care of it.</li>
            <li> This product is impossible for getting an even tan. Forget using it on your face--it doesn&#x27;t spray on evenly and drips in clumps.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s in my &amp;#34;give away&amp;#34; basket</li>
            <li> Love this, best spray tan.</li>
            <li> Used to buy amber sun from my tanning salon but this product I have no complaints about and it was a much better price</li>
            <li> this product and brand is amazing , a must have for tanners and fake tanners, everyone need this product, I love the color and the smell</li>
            <li> Best tanning product on market.No streaks - no spotting- no orange.Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through many tanning products, but California Tan has got to be the best. I own every single product their is, and I absolutely love this one! The California Tan sprays on evenly leaving your skin golden brown! I will be buying more of this product!</li>
            <li> I was reallllly leary about buying this online, but when it arrived (super fast) It was sealed and I had my old bottle of CTan that I bought from my tanning salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It smells the same.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s the exact same bottle.&lt;br /&gt;- Tested it on my feet (wasn&#x27;t sure if it was gunna be blochy) and it worked great..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spray my feet and sides of my arms (that misses the tan for some odd reason) and then after about 5 minutes I pat myself down with a towel and then I put some lotion on after and its great. I would recommend buying this ONLY if you know what the heck your doing!!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to others.  It gives nice color to your skin.  I use it at night before bed.  Wash my face, put a little lotion on my eyebrows so they don&#x27;t absorb the color.  Step in shower and spray lightly about arm&#x27;s length away from face.  If you spray too close it runs and coats unevenly. After spraying wipe off eyebrows so they don&#x27;t color. Let dry&lt;br /&gt;a few minutes and go to bed.  Viola, nice color in am.</li>
            <li> Will streak and run which leaves darker areas if not very careful.  It will also leave darker age spots even darker after applications.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different sun tanning sprays, and this one wasnt very good. you have to spay ten feet away to get an semi even tan. the bronzer is messy, and the smell still smells like that fake tanner smell. I got it because it said that the tanning odor was not there, but I still smelled it.</li>
            <li> Stays longer then going to the tanning salon. It even works on your face. Just close your eyes and spray.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff so much I bought 3 more bottles. The color is great and there is very little smell. The only suggestion I have for purcasers is to put it on right after you have showered and exfoliated. After about 10 min I put my favorite lotion over it and it lopks great!</li>
            <li> Oh! This tanning product is great! It doesn&#x27;t leave you looking &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34;! It looks like you have a true tan from the sun! Love it!</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product. It turned me orange! I had been a Fake Bake user and wanted to try something new and regret it.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best there is.  I have long given up baking in the sun or using the tanning beds.  I have been in search of the perfect sunless tan product.  I have tried everything on the market, from the inexpensive to the pricey, so I know what&#x27;s out there.  Well after trying the rest I have settled on the best.  The color is wonderful, no more orange.  I kept trying to convince everyone that orange was the new tan, but they weren&#x27;t buying it.  Now I no longer have to keep up that charade (it was getting exhausting).  To those of you that think this is messy, let me offer a suggestion.  Use surgical gloves to apply.  Spray directly on the glove and rub into the areas you want to tan.  No more mess.  Give it a try, you will not be disappointed in this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks go out to California Tan for making such a great product.</li>
            <li> I Received the quality items (spray tan) in a couple days! This company is Quick and dependable!! I would recommend them!!</li>
            <li> My complexion is fair with pink undertones and this product appears more orange on me than the Designer Skin product line.</li>
            <li> Messy and way too dark.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!! IT GIVES YOU A BEAUTIFUL NATURAL BRONZE TAN.</li>
            <li> best tanner ever. i&#x27;ve tried a bunch and i love the way this one looks and how easily it goes on. the smell is not horrible either. good stuff!</li>
            <li> I have been spray tanning for years- I am from New Jersey and tanning is what we do. I stay away from FAKE BAKE because it&#x27;s so unhealthy- but I Love, Love, Love to spray tan. I used to spray once or twice a week and pay about 75/ monthly in a salon. This product is FABULOUS! I have already used it three times in three weeks and I still have at least two more applications left. It last longer than the salon spray tans and I&#x27;m Italian with a fairly Olive Complexion and this stuff makes me GLOW! It&#x27;s a beautiful bronze tan in 4 hours or less. Only thing, they may need to work on, is it can get a bit drippy or messy- but if you shower, exfoliate and spray (on tile floor for easy wipe)-- YOU WILL LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This is the best tan in a can I&#x27;ve come across. I used to use this brand&#x27;s tanning lotion and loved it. The spray comes out quick but evenly, which is nice because if you&#x27;re doing your whole body it takes like 3 minutes! The color is similar to a spray tan at the salon, so not a super fake/orange color. Also lasts just as long if not longer than a spray tan from the salon. It also smells really good! I would recommend this product over other brands!</li>
            <li> I used to both recieve and give air brush tans with the california tan solution and I loved it and all of my clients loved it. So I ordered this thinking it would save some money but this product does not spray evenly at all. Sometimes it spits solution in splotches. It&#x27;s also VERY messy. I had to wash my WHOLE bathroom after using this. Including walls. I even put down two towels first. I ended up hopping in the shower right after putting it on. And the one full body application took almost the whole bottle. I won&#x27;t be getting this again. I&#x27;m just going to continue paying extra for the airbrush tans.&lt;br /&gt;I will say that the solution is the same as the one we used in the spa though. The distribution just sucks really bad haha.</li>
            <li> Very very messy, you&#x27;ll need to clean your whole bathroom after use. The smell is okay, feels a little goopy, and takes longer then normal to dry. The color is alright, a little orangy for my liking but it does the trick.</li>
            <li> great product looks NATURAL easy to spray oN love the color can&#x27;t live my house with out it xoxoxoxox xo</li>
            <li> Perfect hue for my light skin and easy to apply with minimal lines.</li>
            <li> Sprays nice and even...leaves even tan did not turn orange or any other color..tons of compliments on tan very very natural looking</li>
            <li> This tan has a wide constant spray and a very nice scent.  It builds gradually to a very nice bronze glow-- not orange and not too pink. My favorite so far!</li>
            <li> This spray goes on evenly and will give you an immediate bronze glow which progresses over a few hours after application. What I love most about this product is that is smells great- it does not have that typical \\&quot;spray tan\\&quot; scent that is associated with most other products. Be careful because the spray does come out fast. I would also recommend not using this product on carpeted areas as the spray will travel to the ground and make a mess. I have a light/medium complexion and this product gave me a nice glow- definitely would recommend over fake and bake spray products.</li>
            <li> I have worked in tanning salons for over 3yrs and I used the california tan machine however, this stuff is so much better! I LOVE IT!! If I want it darker I can make it darker! Its just fabulous!</li>
            <li> Love It! Gives you an instant natural healthy looking tan that last about 4-7 days.  All my friends kept asking  me how do I find time to go to the beach and get such a nice looking tan on my busy schedule.&lt;br /&gt;If you use it daily you will get darker results. I use it every other day two days. Looks fantastic and natural and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Product was received quickly and containers were sealed.  Much appreciated!!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t tan you evenly, then fades in blotches. I&#x27;m a Fake Bake fan. California Tan and Fake Bake cost about the same. Get Fake Bake instead.</li>
            <li> I gave this a 5 star rating because it is by far one of the best sunless tanning products I have ever used. The application is basically fool-proof. The mist that comes out of the can is very fine, so no dots or splashes of product when you are applying it. Which hello is SO important, I can&#x27;t tell you how many sunless tanning products I&#x27;ve used where the mist comes out chopping or dotty. This does NOT do that at all! Another thing I really liked is that the smell isn&#x27;t gross, its like a floral type smell. Which you do get the usual sunless tanning smell after the product has sat on your skin to process its not really that bad. Also this sunless tanner has a bronzer in it so you get instant color. The develop time is also nice only 4 hours instead of the usual 6-8 for most sunless products. All in all I really enjoy and like this product, I have already purchased 4 cans over the last 3 months. Oh and did I mention you get at least 3-4 applications out of each can?!? Well you do :)</li>
            <li> Comes out to fast for control.. But otherwise good!</li>
            <li> Yes it has overspray and yes it still smells like fake tanner (they all do), but as far as ease of application, price and evenness of color go, this one takes the cake. It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Looks super fake and orange. I do not recommend. Try Fake Bake Flawless :)</li>
