            <li>I currently own 20+</li>

            <li>Like bird feathers :)) Fun color for Fall - I like!!!</li>
            <li>I think it will be better for a pedicure than a manicure.</li>
            <li>but I think for me it is more a pedi color.</li>
            <li>I love this polish.  </li>
            <li>I love this color.  </li>
            <li>My favorite nail polish is OPI</li>
            <li>and I love the holographic effect on my nails.</li>
            <li>I wish it were more representative of whats in the bottle when it dries on my nails.</li>
            <li>It looks much better in the bottle than it does on my nails.</li>
            <li>Essie is one of my favorite brands</li>
            <li>It is more brown than the picture.</li>
            <li>The picture shows a purple/blue color, this is more brown.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure I will still use it.</li>
            <li>I so love this chameleon color.  </li>
            <li>I love this color.</li>
            <li>From all the hype I had hear about this color, I was expecting more.</li>
            <li>I love all of the Essie colors ......</li>
            <li>I love this color.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like it, but took a chance in buying it.</li>
            <li>I have got so many compliments on my nails with this polish.</li>
            <li>Looks best when your nails are short.</li>
            <li>so I think it goes with most of my wardrobe.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and the price was great.</li>
            <li>I love Essie nail polish, but this color was a tad to industrial looking.</li>
            <li>If you like the way the image looks, I am confident you&#x27;ll like this polish.</li>
            <li>I was fascinated by the color of this polish but it looks better in the bottle.</li>
            <li>Very cool colt</li>
            <li>Perhaps it will be great for the young and funky girls for their mani&#x27;s  </li>
            <li>Perfect on my toes, goes with EVERY outfit due to the color changing appearance.</li>
            <li>This product came very quickly - faster than I thought it would.</li>
            <li>The brush and viscosity make them extremely easy to apply all the way to the cuticle with no mistakes.</li>
            <li>Overall, great nail polish and very fun!</li>
            <li>It applies smoothly and it doesn&#x27;t chip easily.</li>
            <li>I was so excited by the hype I bought the full size bottle sight unseen - mistake!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s polychromatic, changing colors depending on the light source.</li>
            <li>In incandescent light it looks  irridescent bugundy.</li>
            <li>I really like the gun metal kind of feel.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why I decided to buy it in the middle of summer lol.</li>
            <li>Such a great one to have.</li>
            <li>color is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>but I got this for relatively cheap</li>
            <li>Essie nail polishes are always fantastic, but this color...</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my 15 year old granddaughter and she loved the polish.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!!!</li>
            <li>Great quality and the color is amazing as usual.  </li>
            <li>Love all the Essie polish, Love the new fall colors and I get alot of compliments.</li>
            <li>So excited to find on amazon.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Hot pink/lavender/blue, really eye catching and shiny.  </li>
            <li>but it looks cool.</li>
            <li>and/or the type or amount of light you&#x27;re in, the color can look more green, more purple or a lovely grayish silvery color.  </li>
            <li>While it is true you can&#x27;t see the blue/green tint on your nails that appears in the bottle, I still think the color that ends up on your nails is very pretty.</li>
            <li>color looks exactly as pictured, you&#x27;ll want to use 2 coats since it&#x27;s on the thin side, Essie&#x27;s brushes are super accurate and make it easy to paint perfectly to the edge of the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and lasts and lasts.  </li>
            <li>It was very pretty on her nails.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m normally someone who likes wacky textures and colors on my nails</li>
            <li>This is a nice color, changes color with the light but mostly to purple and green.  </li>
            <li>This was my very first Essie polish.</li>
            <li>YES, i would order AGAIN, very pretty</li>
            <li>It looks like it has beautiful purple, green &amp; a touch of gold colors.  </li>
            <li>It always has a beautiful metalic look that is never too harsh.  </li>
            <li>Pretty on fingernails, but is an absolute must have for toes!!!</li>
            <li>Lasts more than average metallic polishes and levels nicely on the nail.</li>
            <li>Fun nail color.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money</li>
            <li>and this is definitely my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>so when I put it on my jails aren&#x27;t smooth like you normally get with nail polish.</li>
            <li>I have dark skin so the color doesn&#x27;t look that good on me</li>
            <li>It came very fast.</li>
            <li>The color turns out on a nail exactly how it looks in the bottle.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty color</li>
            <li>You know you will get it fast!</li>
            <li>You really can get away with one coat !</li>
            <li>For the Twill of it is a beautiful duo-chrome that offers two colors in one - purple and green.</li>
            <li>It looks exactly like the color shown once you apply it to nails.</li>
            <li>This iridescent polish looks exactly like I&#x27;d hoped from the picture on the ad.</li>
            <li>I seen a swatch of this color and was interested.</li>
            <li>I also enjoy that this color can work for other seasons too, but I do not see this color becoming a staple or reach for color in my polish collection.</li>
            <li>With a nice base coat and a nice top coat this color not only looks good but last.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see what the sense is of paying so much for this polish in stores when you can get it at amazon for so much cheaper!</li>
            <li>looks more grey than anything -</li>
            <li>Sometimes the colors are hard to find in stores because the popular ones seem to go quick</li>
            <li>Very disappointing…</li>
            <li>It is just straight up purple.</li>
            <li>Absolutely zero problems with seller or deliver of htis item.  </li>
            <li>I really like the Essie nail color collections</li>
            <li>I took one point off because you don&#x27;t see the pink/light purple off as much when it is on your nails.</li>
            <li>It is ALWAYS wrapped very well.</li>
            <li>This really is a winter color.</li>
            <li>So really does like it a lot.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Highly recomenned!</li>
            <li>Essie products are very reliable.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s something I&#x27;m not going to wear much.</li>
            <li>but i really dig it.</li>
            <li>However it is very shinny and not for everyone</li>
            <li>The ONLY reason there aren&#x27;t 5-stars is the coloring looks FAR better in the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Idk whats different with this formula but its so pretty!!</li>
            <li>the color changes depending on the light, much like hematite stone - grey metallic at certain angles, irridescent purple or pearly lilac at others.  </li>
            <li>I got the nail polish back within three days which is really exciting!</li>
            <li>The color chipped faster than I expected, even after putting high quality top coat on it.</li>
            <li>Depending on the light it melds from gray to brown to purple to green, and always dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for the exact effect on my nails and it just comes up looking gray unless you&#x27;re in direct sunlight all the time to see the shimmer of all the colors.</li>
            <li>It is a dark color with a lovely iridescence.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a dark blue-green color with flashes of brown in the bottle</li>
            <li>I was looking forward to much better quality and less chipping/</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just different, but very pretty on.</li>
            <li>Kind of dull on the nails.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a grey polish with a teeny bit of iridescent flash, nothing special.</li>
            <li>It goes on pretty thick and you could get away with a single coat, although I did two for good measure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly but only last about three days on me!!</li>
            <li>I still wear it but make sure to put a few layers of clear coat on to make it look not as bumpy.</li>
            <li>It really does give an actual portrayal of this unusual color.  </li>
            <li>when used with a good base and top coat...</li>
            <li>but once it&#x27;s applied, it&#x27;s more of a solid dark silver and the blue-green</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been about one year since i purchased and it&#x27;s still thin, runny, and applies nicely.  </li>
            <li>so I was excited to try something a little nicer for a change.  </li>
            <li>In low, natural light, it looks irridescent pewter with a slight pinkish cast.</li>
            <li>This is just plain fun!</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as diverse in color in real life as it looks in the picture, but it definitely is different colors in different lights.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a sort of greyish purple and then turns into metallic green in different types of light.</li>
            <li>that the polish looks more green at times than any other color.</li>
            <li>only appears when the light hits it in a very narrow range.  </li>
            <li>More then I ever have with any other color I have worn in the past.</li>
            <li>The formula is fantastic - not too sheer but not too thick, either.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> If you like the way the image looks, I am confident you&#x27;ll like this polish.</li>
            <li> I was fascinated by the color of this polish but it looks better in the bottle.</li>
            <li> Very cool colt</li>
            <li> Perhaps it will be great for the young and funky girls for their mani&#x27;s  </li>
            <li> Perfect on my toes, goes with EVERY outfit due to the color changing appearance.</li>
            <li> This product came very quickly - faster than I thought it would.</li>
            <li> The brush and viscosity make them extremely easy to apply all the way to the cuticle with no mistakes.</li>
            <li> Overall, great nail polish and very fun!</li>
            <li> It applies smoothly and it doesn&#x27;t chip easily.</li>
            <li> I was so excited by the hype I bought the full size bottle sight unseen - mistake!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s polychromatic, changing colors depending on the light source.</li>
            <li> In incandescent light it looks  irridescent bugundy.</li>
            <li> I really like the gun metal kind of feel.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I decided to buy it in the middle of summer lol.</li>
            <li> Such a great one to have.</li>
            <li> color is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> but I got this for relatively cheap</li>
            <li> Essie nail polishes are always fantastic, but this color...</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my 15 year old granddaughter and she loved the polish.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!!!</li>
            <li> Great quality and the color is amazing as usual.  </li>
            <li> Love all the Essie polish, Love the new fall colors and I get alot of compliments.</li>
            <li> So excited to find on amazon.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Hot pink/lavender/blue, really eye catching and shiny.  </li>
            <li> but it looks cool.</li>
            <li> and/or the type or amount of light you&#x27;re in, the color can look more green, more purple or a lovely grayish silvery color.  </li>
            <li> While it is true you can&#x27;t see the blue/green tint on your nails that appears in the bottle, I still think the color that ends up on your nails is very pretty.</li>
            <li> color looks exactly as pictured, you&#x27;ll want to use 2 coats since it&#x27;s on the thin side, Essie&#x27;s brushes are super accurate and make it easy to paint perfectly to the edge of the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and lasts and lasts.  </li>
            <li> It was very pretty on her nails.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m normally someone who likes wacky textures and colors on my nails</li>
            <li> This is a nice color, changes color with the light but mostly to purple and green.  </li>
            <li> This was my very first Essie polish.</li>
            <li> YES, i would order AGAIN, very pretty</li>
            <li> It looks like it has beautiful purple, green &amp; a touch of gold colors.  </li>
            <li> It always has a beautiful metalic look that is never too harsh.  </li>
            <li> Pretty on fingernails, but is an absolute must have for toes!!!</li>
            <li> Lasts more than average metallic polishes and levels nicely on the nail.</li>
            <li> Fun nail color.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money</li>
            <li> and this is definitely my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> so when I put it on my jails aren&#x27;t smooth like you normally get with nail polish.</li>
            <li> I have dark skin so the color doesn&#x27;t look that good on me</li>
            <li> It came very fast.</li>
            <li> The color turns out on a nail exactly how it looks in the bottle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty color</li>
            <li> You know you will get it fast!</li>
            <li> You really can get away with one coat !</li>
            <li> For the Twill of it is a beautiful duo-chrome that offers two colors in one - purple and green.</li>
            <li> It looks exactly like the color shown once you apply it to nails.</li>
            <li> This iridescent polish looks exactly like I&#x27;d hoped from the picture on the ad.</li>
            <li> I seen a swatch of this color and was interested.</li>
            <li> I also enjoy that this color can work for other seasons too, but I do not see this color becoming a staple or reach for color in my polish collection.</li>
            <li> With a nice base coat and a nice top coat this color not only looks good but last.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see what the sense is of paying so much for this polish in stores when you can get it at amazon for so much cheaper!</li>
            <li> looks more grey than anything -</li>
            <li> Sometimes the colors are hard to find in stores because the popular ones seem to go quick</li>
            <li> Very disappointing…</li>
            <li> It is just straight up purple.</li>
            <li> Absolutely zero problems with seller or deliver of htis item.  </li>
            <li> I really like the Essie nail color collections</li>
            <li> I took one point off because you don&#x27;t see the pink/light purple off as much when it is on your nails.</li>
            <li> It is ALWAYS wrapped very well.</li>
            <li> This really is a winter color.</li>
            <li> So really does like it a lot.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Highly recomenned!</li>
            <li> Essie products are very reliable.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s something I&#x27;m not going to wear much.</li>
            <li> but i really dig it.</li>
            <li> However it is very shinny and not for everyone</li>
            <li> The ONLY reason there aren&#x27;t 5-stars is the coloring looks FAR better in the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Idk whats different with this formula but its so pretty!!</li>
            <li> the color changes depending on the light, much like hematite stone - grey metallic at certain angles, irridescent purple or pearly lilac at others.  </li>
            <li> I got the nail polish back within three days which is really exciting!</li>
            <li> The color chipped faster than I expected, even after putting high quality top coat on it.</li>
            <li> Depending on the light it melds from gray to brown to purple to green, and always dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for the exact effect on my nails and it just comes up looking gray unless you&#x27;re in direct sunlight all the time to see the shimmer of all the colors.</li>
            <li> It is a dark color with a lovely iridescence.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like a dark blue-green color with flashes of brown in the bottle</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to much better quality and less chipping/</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just different, but very pretty on.</li>
            <li> Kind of dull on the nails.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a grey polish with a teeny bit of iridescent flash, nothing special.</li>
            <li> It goes on pretty thick and you could get away with a single coat, although I did two for good measure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly but only last about three days on me!!</li>
            <li> I still wear it but make sure to put a few layers of clear coat on to make it look not as bumpy.</li>
            <li> It really does give an actual portrayal of this unusual color.  </li>
            <li> when used with a good base and top coat...</li>
            <li> but once it&#x27;s applied, it&#x27;s more of a solid dark silver and the blue-green</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about one year since i purchased and it&#x27;s still thin, runny, and applies nicely.  </li>
            <li> so I was excited to try something a little nicer for a change.  </li>
            <li> In low, natural light, it looks irridescent pewter with a slight pinkish cast.</li>
            <li> This is just plain fun!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as diverse in color in real life as it looks in the picture, but it definitely is different colors in different lights.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sort of greyish purple and then turns into metallic green in different types of light.</li>
            <li> that the polish looks more green at times than any other color.</li>
            <li> only appears when the light hits it in a very narrow range.  </li>
            <li> More then I ever have with any other color I have worn in the past.</li>
            <li> The formula is fantastic - not too sheer but not too thick, either.</li>
            <li> With base and top coat!!</li>
            <li> The color in the photo looks like a swirl of pretty colors, but it goes on like a dull purple.</li>
            <li> The color is very prismatic and I was so anxious to try it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun and tough looking.</li>
            <li> Expected something different I suppose .</li>
            <li> Advertised as a multi-dimensional color, not really.  </li>
            <li> I have fingernails where the edges fall deep into the skin, so it&#x27;s almost impossible to get full polish coverage without having to do a lot of pen-correction afterward, but with Essie polishes I almost never have to do any cleanup.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, IMO, it isn&#x27;t even a pretty purple.</li>
            <li> Not clumpy or streaky like other metallics.</li>
            <li> Love this crazy color nail polish!</li>
            <li> Essie usually last a little over a week for me!!</li>
            <li> so I use the essie base and top coat.</li>
            <li> It shimmers in different subtle colors.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I will put a little sparkle on the tip.</li>
            <li> My only disappointment is that there are little tiny specs/clumps in my nail polish</li>
            <li> In sunlight, it looks irridescent green.</li>
            <li> I basically get 2 colors out of it, green and purple.</li>
            <li> It has a green metallic shine at one angle then gives a burgundy metallic shine from another angle.</li>
            <li> unlike a couple of other reviewers, it never looks dull on my nails.  </li>
            <li> almost makes nails look dirty - odd effect</li>
            <li> A little disappointing</li>
            <li> i expected to hate this color</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t crazy about it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing I just got a bad bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite disappointed.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t hate it either.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> For The Twill Of It is a lovely color!! Goes on smoothly but only last about three days on me!! Essie usually last a little over a week for me!! With base and top coat!! Idk whats different with this formula but its so pretty!! Fast shipping!!!</li>
            <li> I do like this color from Essie. I think it will be better for a pedicure than a manicure. Perhaps it will be great for the young and funky girls for their mani&#x27;s  but I think for me it is more a pedi color. It is gorgeous though.</li>
            <li> I love this polish.  It is every color purples, pinks, blues, greens.  It goes with everything in my closet.  This is just plain fun!</li>
            <li> Beautiful color, and it dries very fast and is easy to remove! A very perfect fall color or a fabulous accent nail.</li>
            <li> The color in the photo looks like a swirl of pretty colors, but it goes on like a dull purple. Very disappointing…</li>
            <li> I bought this because it looked like it was multi-colored. It looks like it has beautiful purple, green &amp; a touch of gold colors.  The color shown almost looked like it was a gorgeous layer of pearl colors. I&#x27;m quite disappointed.  When applied to your nails, it is not multi-colored at all! It is just straight up purple. Unfortunately, IMO, it isn&#x27;t even a pretty purple. If I just saw this purple shade in a bottle, I would not have purchased it.</li>
            <li> Just got this today - it&#x27;s great :) Reminds me of labradorite - it&#x27;s polychromatic, changing colors depending on the light source. In low, natural light, it looks irridescent pewter with a slight pinkish cast. In sunlight, it looks irridescent green. In incandescent light it looks  irridescent bugundy. Like bird feathers :)) Fun color for Fall - I like!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kinda like another reviewer in that the polish looks more green at times than any other color. I basically get 2 colors out of it, green and purple. Don&#x27;t get me wrong it&#x27;s very cute on and I&#x27;ve gotten plenty of compliments. It&#x27;s just different, but very pretty on.</li>
            <li> I love this color.  My favorite nail polish is OPI My Private Jet.  This color I think is a close second.</li>
            <li> Absolutely zero problems with seller or deliver of htis item.  The ONLY reason there aren&#x27;t 5-stars is the coloring looks FAR better in the bottle.  I was hoping for the exact effect on my nails and it just comes up looking gray unless you&#x27;re in direct sunlight all the time to see the shimmer of all the colors.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of essie nail polish and this did not disappoint.  The color turns out on a nail exactly how it looks in the bottle.  It is surprisingly durable also, and lasted longer than I had anticipated.  Overall, great nail polish and very fun!</li>
            <li> This was a great buy and a great color for fall. It looks like twill. I really like the Essie nail color collections it&#x27;s one of the best polish brands Ive ever tried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty color and I love the holographic effect on my nails. I wish it were more representative of whats in the bottle when it dries on my nails. I also enjoy that this color can work for other seasons too, but I do not see this color becoming a staple or reach for color in my polish collection.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get the rave reviews for this. I was so excited by the hype I bought the full size bottle sight unseen - mistake! It looks much better in the bottle than it does on my nails. It&#x27;s just a grey polish with a teeny bit of iridescent flash, nothing special. Yawn.</li>
            <li> This is one of those prism nail colors that changes in different lights.  Hot pink/lavender/blue, really eye catching and shiny.  It dries quickly and lasts and lasts.  Sadly it&#x27;ll probably be discontinued, like all the colors I really love.  But this is a good price and I hope to stock up before it goes away.</li>
            <li> Fun nail color. I took one point off because you don&#x27;t see the pink/light purple off as much when it is on your nails. However, I haven&#x27;t seen another nail color quite like it. Essie always make quality nail polishes.</li>
            <li> Love this polish! It&#x27;s perfect for a winter color. I look forward to wearing it again. Essie is amazing! BUY IT!</li>
            <li> This is truly one of my favorite shades!!! With a nice base coat and a nice top coat this color not only looks good but last. Essie is one of my favorite brands so I use the essie base and top coat. But I also have a nice opi top coat that works well too.</li>
            <li> This product came very quickly - faster than I thought it would. It is more brown than the picture. The picture shows a purple/blue color, this is more brown. A little disappointing but I&#x27;m sure I will still use it.</li>
            <li> Love all the Essie polish, Love the new fall colors and I get alot of compliments. Sometimes I will put a little sparkle on the tip.</li>
            <li> I love this color! It looks great with any outfit choice and adds the &amp;#34;fun&amp;#34; flare to your outfit without being &amp;#34;too much.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see what the sense is of paying so much for this polish in stores when you can get it at amazon for so much cheaper! It is ALWAYS wrapped very well. I have never had a problem with them breaking and they seem to ship immediately. You know you will get it fast! Sometimes the colors are hard to find in stores because the popular ones seem to go quick but I can ALWAYS find what I need here! Very satisfied customer!,</li>
            <li> Beautiful colour and very nice looking on nails, it arrived in perfect condition and very good quality product. Well worth the money</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my 15 year old granddaughter and she loved the polish. It was very pretty on her nails.</li>
            <li> Two coats does it, I like the way it covers. Also surprisingly durable. Not clumpy or streaky like other metallics.</li>
            <li> I used this color once before and I wasn&#x27;t crazy about it but then a couple of weeks later I tried again. I suppose it was my mood. I really like the gun metal kind of feel. It&#x27;s fun and tough looking.</li>
            <li> I so love this chameleon color.  Perfect on my toes, goes with EVERY outfit due to the color changing appearance.</li>
            <li> I am basing the review of this polish by the look of the bottle only, I have not used it. It is a dark color with a lovely iridescence.</li>
            <li> I really liked this nail polish! It isn&#x27;t as diverse in color in real life as it looks in the picture, but it definitely is different colors in different lights.  I got the nail polish back within three days which is really exciting! I was worried about how it would be packaged and if it would get to my home safe, but it was packaged beautifully and there was no damage to the product.</li>
            <li> It came very fast. It came in like 3 days I think. I have dark skin so the color doesn&#x27;t look that good on me but it looks cool. This really is a winter color. I don&#x27;t know why I decided to buy it in the middle of summer lol. I may used it in the winter but not now. &amp; the formula is amazing ! You really can get away with one coat !</li>
            <li> looks more grey than anything - almost makes nails look dirty - odd effect and i&#x27;m normally someone who likes wacky textures and colors on my nails but this didn&#x27;t have the effect i thought it would. No diss to essie though - still a big fan, just not a fan of this color</li>
            <li> I love this color. I would recommend it to my friends and family. I received it within the time frame I was told it would be here.</li>
            <li> I love this color its a beauty,Essie For The Twill of it,amazing color,Essie keep making more beautiful colors like this one</li>
            <li> Beautiful color from Essie, and this brand along with Opi are my favorites. I am a lover of irridescent tones.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite nail polish I own. It applies smoothly and it doesn&#x27;t chip easily. Best of all it changes colors! It&#x27;s a sort of greyish purple and then turns into metallic green in different types of light. When I wear it I sometimes tilt my hands back and forth to watch it change colors.</li>
            <li> I had seen this color in a magazine but couldn&#x27;t find it on the store. So excited to find on amazon. It&#x27;s a great color goes with everything</li>
            <li> I only recently began using Essie polishes for my manicures. This color is gorgeous. While it is true you can&#x27;t see the blue/green tint on your nails that appears in the bottle, I still think the color that ends up on your nails is very pretty. It has a nice shimmer and multi-dimensional sheen to it. I currently own 20+ Essie shades and this is definitely my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> Perfect color and arrived quickly, wore off easily though even with a top coat.</li>
            <li> This is a nice color, changes color with the light but mostly to purple and green.  From all the hype I had hear about this color, I was expecting more.</li>
            <li> This color is amazing. Depending on the light it melds from gray to brown to purple to green, and always dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Saw this as a great go-to polish in a magazine.  Advertised as a multi-dimensional color, not really.  Color comes out as a nice grayish purple which turned out to be be fine for my fair skin.  It&#x27;s been about one year since i purchased and it&#x27;s still thin, runny, and applies nicely.  I love Essie!!!!</li>
            <li> Lmao got this as a stocking stuffer for my gf. She says it beauuuuuuuutiful! So really does like it a lot. So if looking for confirmation on good nail polish or trying to earn points with your lady. Buy buy buy</li>
            <li> I love all of the Essie colors ...... their polish is the best!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite colors!</li>
            <li> I love this color. It&#x27;s one of my favorites for winter. It has a green metallic shine at one angle then gives a burgundy metallic shine from another angle. Such a great one to have. My only disappointment is that there are little tiny specs/clumps in my nail polish so when I put it on my jails aren&#x27;t smooth like you normally get with nail polish. I&#x27;m guessing I just got a bad bottle. I still wear it but make sure to put a few layers of clear coat on to make it look not as bumpy.</li>
            <li> For the Twill of it is a beautiful duo-chrome that offers two colors in one - purple and green. The formula is fantastic - not too sheer but not too thick, either. A good buy, with quick shipping!</li>
            <li> This was my very first Essie polish. I&#x27;ve only owned drugstore brands so I was excited to try something a little nicer for a change.  I was looking forward to much better quality and less chipping/peeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is fantastic.  It shimmers and changes colors when you look at it with different angles.  It goes on pretty thick and you could get away with a single coat, although I did two for good measure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even when used with a good base and top coat...it still chips and peels the next day.  Guess I&#x27;ll stick to my drugstore brands....but I got this for relatively cheap so I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color!! Different!</li>
            <li> It shimmers in different subtle colors.  It&#x27;s also darker than the photo suggests.  It&#x27;s more like a dark blue-green color with flashes of brown in the bottle but once it&#x27;s applied, it&#x27;s more of a solid dark silver and the blue-green only appears when the light hits it in a very narrow range.  The color flashing seemed to disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m neutral about this one.  I don&#x27;t partucularly like it but I don&#x27;t hate it either.</li>
            <li> YES, i would order AGAIN, very pretty</li>
            <li> It looks exactly like the color shown once you apply it to nails. I am very pleased. I bought this color to match an iridescent dress I bought and it matches perfect. Essie is a great brand of polish too. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Love this crazy color nail polish! I saw it in Kohls around the holidays. Wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like it, but took a chance in buying it. I have got so many compliments on my nails with this polish. More then I ever have with any other color I have worn in the past. Looks best when your nails are short. Has a denim, grayish look so I think it goes with most of my wardrobe. Highly recomenned!</li>
            <li> Essie products are very reliable. So many great colors to choose from when you want to change things up. Goes on smoothly and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Great quality and the color is amazing as usual.  Essie is the beat nail polish in my opinion.  Shipping was fast and the price was great.</li>
            <li> The color chipped faster than I expected, even after putting high quality top coat on it. However, it is a very pretty fall lacquer and it looks great.</li>
            <li> I love Essie nail polish, but this color was a tad to industrial looking. Very cool colt but it&#x27;s something I&#x27;m not going to wear much. Expected something different I suppose .</li>
            <li> Short version: color looks exactly as pictured, you&#x27;ll want to use 2 coats since it&#x27;s on the thin side, Essie&#x27;s brushes are super accurate and make it easy to paint perfectly to the edge of the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m once again impressed by the quality of Essie polishes. The brush and viscosity make them extremely easy to apply all the way to the cuticle with no mistakes. I have fingernails where the edges fall deep into the skin, so it&#x27;s almost impossible to get full polish coverage without having to do a lot of pen-correction afterward, but with Essie polishes I almost never have to do any cleanup. This iridescent polish looks exactly like I&#x27;d hoped from the picture on the ad. If you like the way the image looks, I am confident you&#x27;ll like this polish.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m trying to break out of my sheer neutral color polish habit.  i expected to hate this color but i really dig it. the color changes depending on the light, much like hematite stone - grey metallic at certain angles, irridescent purple or pearly lilac at others.  unlike a couple of other reviewers, it never looks dull on my nails.  the metallic/pearl finish is ultra shiny.</li>
            <li> Essie nail polishes are always fantastic, but this color... this color is phenomenal!  It&#x27;s almost like a flip flop paint.  Depending on the angle you look at it and/or the type or amount of light you&#x27;re in, the color can look more green, more purple or a lovely grayish silvery color.  It always has a beautiful metalic look that is never too harsh.  The color swatch of the bottle shown on Amazon.com is as close to actual as is probably possible.  It really does give an actual portrayal of this unusual color.  Pretty on fingernails, but is an absolute must have for toes!!!</li>
            <li> Chic and fits a variety of occasions and seasons. Lasts more than average metallic polishes and levels nicely on the nail.</li>
            <li> This was shipped and arrived faster than promised.  The color is very prismatic and I was so anxious to try it I painted it over neon orange polish.  It covered that color without any hint of the orange showing!</li>
            <li> I seen a swatch of this color and was interested. However it is very shinny and not for everyone</li>
            <li> I was fascinated by the color of this polish but it looks better in the bottle. Kind of dull on the nails.</li>
