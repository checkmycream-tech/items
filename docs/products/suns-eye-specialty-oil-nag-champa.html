            <li>Love the Nag...</li>
            <li>Striking close to the incense.  </li>
            <li>Have bought 3!  love it</li>
            <li>If you love the smell of the incense you will love this.  </li>
            <li>Great quality and will absolutely order this again.  </li>
            <li>I just came in from mowing the lawn and my whole house smells great.</li>
            <li>one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Everyone seems to notice and love it.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li>The delivery was great and far more prompt than was estimated by the computer.</li>
            <li>First time customer, and a VERY satisfied one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love sweet Patchouli from Sun&#x27;s Eye...which I will always buy.</li>
            <li>Pure Bliss!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definetely a musk, but also smells a bit floral with a hint of light jasmine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product itself was great, to no surprise, since I have used this same oil before.</li>
            <li>Can mix into used wax on a warmer and enjoy the scent.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone looking for the true Nag Champa scent.</li>
            <li>This oil has a true Nag Champa scent.</li>
            <li>if you really love nag champa, this is the real thing.</li>
            <li>the smell is so sweet and fills the room.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not a fan of sweet, or if you want a little variation depending on your mood, throw in a drop of a strong, citrusy oil like grapefruit (Aura Acacia&#x27;s is great).</li>
            <li>Nag Champa is one of my favorite scents and this stuff really smells like the real deal!</li>
            <li>Exactly what she wanted for Mothers Day!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s somewhat light, but very fragrant.</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t smell right to me.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this very pure Nag Champa oil as well as the Uncrossing oil.</li>
            <li>A little sweeter, more floral than the incense, probably because it&#x27;s not a burned scent, but I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Pure undisputed!</li>
            <li>Pure!</li>
            <li>this is the real deal!</li>
            <li>Its long lasting and a beautiful light smell, only need a touch, definate recommend!</li>
            <li>Also, a little bit on old incense stick  to revitalize and a bit on a cotton puff in your cigarette holder in your car/truck is great.  </li>
            <li>It is 100% pure Nag Champa deliciousness.</li>
            <li>this is pure...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>thanks will order again</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to everyone that loves Nag Champ as much as I do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a huge fan of incense because it irritates my throat, so it&#x27;s nice to have an alternative in oil form.</li>
            <li>Price without Prime is a bit high.</li>
            <li>We highly recommend.</li>
            <li>My mom asked me to put a few drops in an electric oil burner in the living room when she smelled my room. :-)</li>
            <li>Where I live you can&#x27;t burn candles.</li>
            <li>when you first put it on, its not apparent.</li>
            <li>I have a nebulizer diffuser, and 3 drops really make my whole room smell from the other side of the house.</li>
            <li>but give it a little time and its EXACTLY the same smell as satya/blue &amp; white box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks sun&#x27;s eye.</li>

            <li> Makes them welcoming after a long day.</li>
            <li> I have tried other variations of Nag Champa, and the off brands smell totally different than Sun&#x27;s Eye.  </li>

            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>

            <li> After reading through a bunch of reviews on the Nag Champa oils offered on amazon, I stumbled across a review (for another supplier) that recommended the Nag Champa oil &amp;#34;with the black top&amp;#34;, instead of the oil</li>

            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but for this little bundle of amazingness I had to!!</li>
            <li> Not the smell I remember from the late 70&#x27;s or 80&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Smells like Secret for Women baby powder scented underarm deodorant.</li>
            <li> Very weak for Champa.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with the price.</li>
            <li> Made me sick to my stomach...</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use this in my laundry especially on my sheets. Makes them welcoming after a long day. Also use it in my home in my Scentsy warmers....works great and makes my cabin smell so nice.</li>
            <li> These oils are amazing. They raise the vibration. I noticed a big shift in the mood of our home after using these. Even my animals started acting like puppies. My massage therapist who comes to my home noticed it before I even told her. You can&#x27;t go wrong with the price.</li>
            <li> All i can say is: I LOVE IT!!!  Its long lasting and a beautiful light smell, only need a touch, definate recommend!</li>
            <li> Nag Champa is one of my favorite scents and this stuff really smells like the real deal! I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Love the Nag... thanks will order again</li>
            <li> Very weak for Champa. Don&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> Not the smell I remember from the late 70&#x27;s or 80&#x27;s.  It just doesn&#x27;t smell right to me.  Can&#x27;t pinpoint the difference, but wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> My wife discovered this in her yoga class. She loves it.</li>
            <li> This oil is magical!  Striking close to the incense.  If you&#x27;re a fan of nag champa incense and don&#x27;t mind a hint of vanilla undertone this is for you!!  Will not disappoint.  Whenever I burn the oil I get glowing approval and applause.  A must have</li>
            <li> Have bought 3!  love it</li>
            <li> Smells great! Soothing in my tence enviorment.&lt;br /&gt;Get a lot compliments.</li>
            <li> If you love the smell of the incense you will love this.  Lasts a long time if you use as a perfume - only need a little bit.

            <li> Exactly what she wanted for Mothers Day! Not an inferior knockoff... this is the real deal! Would recommend to anyone looking for the true Nag Champa scent.</li>
            <li> I had never heard of it. But smelled a candle with it and loved. Where I live you can&#x27;t burn candles. Bought a fan diffuser. Just put a few drops of oil on the pad and turn it on. Soon after my room smells great.</li>
            <li> This is great in my warmer. I just came in from mowing the lawn and my whole house smells great.</li>
            <li> Beautiful product. Would definitely recommend to a friend!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this oil.  Received quickly, fair price, would purchase again.  This oil has a true Nag Champa scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved the smell of Nag Champa and I was thrilled to find it in oil form. After reading through a bunch of reviews on the Nag Champa oils offered on amazon, I stumbled across a review (for another supplier) that recommended the Nag Champa oil &amp;#34;with the black top&amp;#34;, instead of the oil the review was under.  I rolled the dice and bought this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely LOVE it. It&#x27;s somewhat light, but very fragrant. It smells a lot like the Nag Champa, &amp;#34;Sunrise&amp;#34; incense. It&#x27;s definetely a musk, but also smells a bit floral with a hint of light jasmine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lifts my spirit and is very pleasant and tranquil. I will definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but for this little bundle of amazingness I had to!! It is 100% pure Nag Champa deliciousness. I would recommend this product to everyone that loves Nag Champ as much as I do.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell. Made me sick to my stomach...I love sweet Patchouli from Sun&#x27;s Eye...which I will always buy. I would suggest going to a store that sells sun&#x27;s eye oil before you buy here!</li>
            <li> if you really love nag champa, this is the real thing. when you first put it on, its not apparent. but give it a little time and its EXACTLY the same smell as satya/blue &amp; white box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks sun&#x27;s eye.</li>
            <li> Buying this product met all of my expectations. The delivery was great and far more prompt than was estimated by the computer. The product itself was great, to no surprise, since I have used this same oil before.</li>
            <li> I purchased this very pure Nag Champa oil as well as the Uncrossing oil. First time customer, and a VERY satisfied one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil is amazing.

            <li> One of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li> Total garbage. Smells like Secret for Women baby powder scented underarm deodorant. I&#x27;ve been using Nag Champa incense since i was a teenager, over 30 years, this smells nothing like it at all. Very disappointed. I will be attempting to get my money back.</li>
            <li> this is pure...the smell is so sweet and fills the room.  one of the best I&#x27;ve found in a while</li>
            <li> Awesome Nag-Champa scented oil!  Almost perfect.  Can mix into used wax on a warmer and enjoy the scent.  Also, a little bit on old incense stick  to revitalize and a bit on a cotton puff in your cigarette holder in your car/truck is great.  Price without Prime is a bit high.</li>
            <li> This is one of the nicer nags that I have found out there. Wonderful fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have tried other variations of Nag Champa, and the off brands smell totally different than Sun&#x27;s Eye.  Sun&#x27;s Eye is the best by far.  I hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it.  We highly recommend.</li>
