    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is probably the best replacement for the Scalpmaster 3000 brush</li>
            <li>But this one does, which is especially nice during dry-scalp season.  </li>
            <li>Either way this brush made the cut and is the perfect size for travel.</li>
            <li>Excellent brush.</li>
            <li>Very good brush.  </li>
            <li>This brush does a great job of keeping it in line.</li>
            <li>It is great brush at a great price.</li>
            <li>A great find.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice brush.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this and ordered many to have at home, in my purse, at work.  </li>
            <li>I like to buy things thru Amazon as they have good service, etc.</li>
            <li>It feels so good when I brush my hair</li>
            <li>and this is a perfect fit.  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t feel as good.</li>
            <li>Still a good tool.</li>
            <li>It feels good, but not abrasive.</li>
            <li>Needs one more row of bristles to be a great brush.</li>
            <li>This brush is pretty awesome.  </li>
            <li>Nice brush</li>
            <li>strong bristles, Loved how it went to my scalp.</li>
            <li>I have tried many brushes and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>This is a VERY cheap brush.</li>
            <li>This one&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got 2.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t a lot to say about a hair brush, but I love it.</li>
            <li>More colors would be nice-black tends to disappear at at the bottom of a purse, etc.</li>
            <li>I tried several but found that this brush is the best.</li>
            <li>I need a brush with more bristles.</li>
            <li>Needs more bristles, and a longer handle.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t what I needed, but its not terrible.</li>
            <li>I gets though my hair and my wiry beard, So much better than just a comb.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>This fits the bill without having to spend a lot and is a much better one than I can find in the stores.</li>
            <li>She has been searching for a good strong brush for quite awhile without success.</li>
            <li>These brushes are not always easy to come by, so I&#x27;m glad I was able to find it here.</li>
            <li>The price is pretty good too</li>
            <li>and I can see this is going to be as good as my old favorite brush.</li>
            <li>It is fairly comfortable to hold</li>
            <li>I bought it because it said it was a full size brush.</li>
            <li>or I got used to them quickly.  </li>
            <li>This brush is okay but not as good as the Goody brush I bought on Amazon a couple years ago and not available anymore.  </li>
            <li>Seems pretty cheap.  </li>
            <li>It is a great little brush.</li>
            <li>but the old Goody ones were WAAAAY better.</li>
            <li>Strong bristles,easy to clean and soft on scalp.</li>
            <li>The price was right, so I took a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li>Refreshing to have products actually be as advertised.  </li>
            <li>great brush, actually works for long hair.</li>
            <li>Really wakes things up!  </li>
            <li>Good quality and stiff bristles.</li>
            <li>It took me a while to find one that I could really brush my hair with ( not just style), that didn&#x27;t include boar bristles.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>They really work on thick hair and help to keep the scalp healthy!</li>
            <li>Nice brush, but smaller than expected.</li>
            <li>A little smaller than my old Goodie brush, but almost as good.  </li>
            <li>When my old brush showed much wear</li>
            <li>The bristles do not look as long, plentiful or full as in the picture description.</li>
            <li>I went on the hunt for a new one.</li>
            <li>This is a great, stiff bristle brush, and small, all of which I like.  </li>
            <li>Very sturdy ......bristles are strong for thick hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a brush with bristles instead of pegs with knobs on the end any more.  </li>
            <li>Bristles are way to far apart.  </li>
            <li>I have an old brush like this which I&#x27;ve had for probably 20 years.  </li>
            <li>This is the closest I&#x27;ve found to my old &amp;#34;goody&amp;#34; bristle brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like it so far.  </li>
            <li>I just like the old fashion nylon bristle brush and this works.</li>
            <li>These bristles are on the bendable soft side.</li>
            <li>I am thinking that after a few weeks or months, the bristles will have worn enough that it will feel more like my old brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So glad to have a source for  brush that gets through thick hair.</li>
            <li>I have thick hair, and most brushes feel like they don&#x27;t even reach my scalp.  </li>
            <li>Bristles are fine but the brush is too small.</li>
            <li>This nylon bristled brush can be used in place of natural bristled brushes or used to clean your super expensive brushes.</li>
            <li>This brush seems sturdy, has bristles full enough and long enough to thoroughly untangle hair and get through to scalp as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably buy a couple more as back ups since they are hard to find.</li>
            <li>far, it is almost the same as my old brush.  </li>
            <li>but I guess that&#x27;s the problem with this type of brush in general.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like this brush, but then again I thought the bristles were going to be harder.  </li>
            <li>Also, it is strong enough to get through my thick hair.  </li>
            <li>All the brushes I had tried brushed my hair but not down to the roots.  </li>
            <li>But at least those are full size.</li>
            <li>On the small size but the bristles are nice and hard</li>
    </ol>

            <li> finally a brush with bristles firm enough to go through my hair when wet and tangled but not so firm as to break huge sections of hair.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight plastic, but bristles are attached firmly &amp; are about 1&amp;#34;  long.</li>
            <li> Thus, long enough to reach my scalp through my medium-thich, though short, hair.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks the bristles calm down</li>
            <li> The bristles in this one are a bit sharp at first but they either round off</li>
            <li> Is exactly what I wanted and works well with thick and hard-to-manage hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick short hair and when I use Scalpmaster brushes, I feel as if my hair has really gotten the brushing it needs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried for a long time to replace it and could never find a match.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> At first the bristles seem very hard and the ends feel sharp on the scalp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a little smaller but the closest I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li> Yes I do like the brush, would like a little bigger.</li>
            <li> Now it seems the only larger brushes have hard teeth instead of bristles.</li>
            <li> These  are not very well made, but I&#x27;ll use &#x27;em until I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a dog grooming brush for the last few years and decided it was time to get a brush.</li>
            <li> I am a male with curly hair and its hard to maintain my hair.</li>
            <li> I do recommend this simple brush for anyone with thick hair.</li>
            <li> less brushing to get hair in conntrol.</li>
            <li> It is definitely NOT a full size brush.</li>
            <li> a little gel</li>
            <li> The label was printed on and smeared off with little effort.</li>
            <li> I suppose the next thing will be a broken handle; I hope not.</li>
            <li> I have long thick curly hair!</li>
            <li> Just a plain brush that does what it is meant to do</li>
            <li> A little small for my hands.</li>
            <li> A little hard to get lint out of the bristle bases, though,</li>
            <li> The brush is small</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, and once it gets longer than 2&amp;#34;, I have difficulty brushing it with the peg &amp; knob brushes.  </li>
            <li> I had been looking for a brush that would reach through my thick hair and stimulate my scalp.  </li>
            <li> If you have thick hair, this brush won&#x27;t help you.</li>
            <li> but I have thick hair and it doesn&#x27;t work as well as I thought it would.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are very small, thin, and there are very few on this brush.</li>
            <li> I was having a very hard time finding a replacment brush in stores.  </li>
            <li> so I have bought some expensive brushes that I don&#x27;t use.</li>

            <li> This brush is pretty awesome.  It&#x27;s hard to find a brush with bristles instead of pegs with knobs on the end any more.  I have thick hair, and once it gets longer than 2&amp;#34;, I have difficulty brushing it with the peg &amp; knob brushes.  The bristles in this one are a bit sharp at first but they either round off or I got used to them quickly.  It&#x27;s does its job well.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that didn&#x27;t include animal products.  It took me a while to find one that I could really brush my hair with ( not just style), that didn&#x27;t include boar bristles.  I am very happy with this and ordered many to have at home, in my purse, at work.  They really work on thick hair and help to keep the scalp healthy!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice brush. I am a male with curly hair and its hard to maintain my hair. This brush does a great job of keeping it in line.</li>
            <li> Why oh why doesn&#x27;t Goody still make this style of brush? This one&#x27;s okay but the old Goody ones were WAAAAY better.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a brush that would reach through my thick hair and stimulate my scalp.  All the brushes I had tried brushed my hair but not down to the roots.  This does.  It is great brush at a great price.</li>
            <li> Got this for my Mom, she loves it! She has been searching for a good strong brush for quite awhile without success. I&#x27;m glad I got 2.</li>
            <li> Bristles are way to far apart.  Seems pretty cheap.  I can&#x27;t seem to find a quality bristle brush.</li>
            <li> I have an old brush like this which I&#x27;ve had for probably 20 years.  It&#x27;s now falling apart.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried for a long time to replace it and could never find a match.  This is the closest I&#x27;ve found to my old &amp;#34;goody&amp;#34; bristle brush.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little smaller but the closest I&#x27;ve found.  I like it so far.  I&#x27;ll probably buy a couple more as back ups since they are hard to find.</li>

            <li> There isn&#x27;t a lot to say about a hair brush, but I love it. It feels so good when I brush my hair it is like giving my scalp a massage. I will buy another one so I have a spare encase I lose this one.</li>
            <li> I just like the old fashion nylon bristle brush and this works. I have thick short hair and when I use Scalpmaster brushes, I feel as if my hair has really gotten the brushing it needs. I bought 2-one for home/ one for travel.</li>

            <li> Does exactly what it says it will do.  Refreshing to have products actually be as advertised.  It is a great little brush.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy ......bristles are strong for thick hair. Definitely recommend. If you you have afro hair that&#x27;s curly or coils -with a little gel this brush tames the hair especially if wearing in a bun or ponytail</li>
            <li> This brush seems sturdy, has bristles full enough and long enough to thoroughly untangle hair and get through to scalp as well.</li>
            <li> finally a brush with bristles firm enough to go through my hair when wet and tangled but not so firm as to break huge sections of hair.</li>
            <li> I have always used nylon bristle brushes (I don&#x27;t like the plastic or metal bristles). When my old brush showed much wear I went on the hunt for a new one. I tried several but found that this brush is the best. At first the bristles seem very hard and the ends feel sharp on the scalp. After a few weeks the bristles calm down and I can see this is going to be as good as my old favorite brush.</li>
            <li> Nice brush but I have thick hair and it doesn&#x27;t work as well as I thought it would.  I need a brush with more bristles.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight plastic, but bristles are attached firmly &amp; are about 1&amp;#34;  long. Thus, long enough to reach my scalp through my medium-thich, though short, hair. Not fancy. Just a plain brush that does what it is meant to do</li>
            <li> strong bristles, Loved how it went to my scalp. less brushing to get hair in conntrol. Wish it were just a tad bigger.</li>
            <li> Bristles are fine but the brush is too small. I bought it because it said it was a full size brush. I would call this purse size. It is definitely NOT a full size brush. The bristle end is only 1 inch by 3 inches. It is fairly comfortable to hold but I would have preferred a larger bristle pad like the ones they used to make when I was growing up. Now it seems the only larger brushes have hard teeth instead of bristles. But at least those are full size. This one is not.</li>
            <li> A little smaller than my old Goodie brush, but almost as good.  These brushes are not always easy to come by, so I&#x27;m glad I was able to find it here.</li>
            <li> The brush is small so it takes lots of strokes to brush my hair, and the bristles are too short to penetrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the bristles though, I want the same brush just 150% bigger in every way.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best replacement for the Scalpmaster 3000 brush</li>
            <li> Is exactly what I wanted and works well with thick and hard-to-manage hair. I keep this in the side pocket of my car.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for! Good quality and stiff bristles. A little hard to get lint out of the bristle bases, though, but I guess that&#x27;s the problem with this type of brush in general.</li>
            <li> I have long thick curly hair! I have tried many brushes and this one is by far the best. Strong bristles,easy to clean and soft on scalp. The price is pretty good too</li>
            <li> On the small size but the bristles are nice and hard so it wakes up your scalp.</li>
            <li> This is a great, stiff bristle brush, and small, all of which I like.  I wanted something for my gym bag and this is a perfect fit.  Also, it is strong enough to get through my thick hair.  A great find.</li>
            <li> Needs more bristles, and a longer handle.</li>
            <li> great brush, actually works for long hair.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I needed, but its not terrible.</li>
            <li> This brush is okay but not as good as the Goody brush I bought on Amazon a couple years ago and not available anymore.  The quality just isn&#x27;t quite there and it doesn&#x27;t feel as good.</li>
            <li> I was having a very hard time finding a replacment brush in stores.  I looked around online, and this was the closest I could get.  The price was right, so I took a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, it is almost the same as my old brush.  I have thick hair, and most brushes feel like they don&#x27;t even reach my scalp.  But this one does, which is especially nice during dry-scalp season.  Really wakes things up!  I am thinking that after a few weeks or months, the bristles will have worn enough that it will feel more like my old brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I do recommend this simple brush for anyone with thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have long hair but I have a reaction to boar bristles so I have bought some expensive brushes that I don&#x27;t use. This nylon bristled brush can be used in place of natural bristled brushes or used to clean your super expensive brushes. Either way this brush made the cut and is the perfect size for travel.</li>
            <li> 24 bucks (incl. shipping) for 3 of these? The label was printed on and smeared off with little effort. Bristles are beginning to come out. I suppose the next thing will be a broken handle; I hope not. These  are not very well made, but I&#x27;ll use &#x27;em until I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Needs one more row of bristles to be a great brush.</li>
            <li> Nice brush, but smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> Very good brush.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Excellent brush. I gets though my hair and my wiry beard, So much better than just a comb. I do, however, wish it were a bit larger brush. A little small for my hands. Still a good tool.</li>
            <li> I wanted a brush that would reach my scalp and this does.  It feels good, but not abrasive. I love it.  I&#x27;ve been using a dog grooming brush for the last few years and decided it was time to get a brush. This fits the bill without having to spend a lot and is a much better one than I can find in the stores.</li>
