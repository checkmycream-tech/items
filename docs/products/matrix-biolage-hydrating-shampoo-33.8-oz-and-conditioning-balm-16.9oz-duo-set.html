            <li>The conditioning balm that comes with it is great for added hydration</li>

            <li>The smell is great.</li>
            <li>Amazon provides great pricing on the combination purchase in comparison to hair salons and hair stores.</li>
            <li>GREAT PRICE.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used this shampoo for years and was really happy to get the conditioning balm with it for the price you would pay at the store for just the shampoo.</li>
            <li>Great price for shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I hope this helps you to decide if this product will be great for you like it was for me.</li>
            <li>and I am so happy she did.</li>
            <li>it works great.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is great, but the conditioner does not work at all.  </li>
            <li>Great product for a great price.  </li>
            <li>Great scent.</li>
            <li>Better than it&#x27;s been in years!!</li>
            <li>The product works amazing!</li>
            <li>This smells really good and leaves my hair feeling great.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner and the prices I find on Amazon for the set are great!  </li>
            <li>it smells wonderful, no harmful ingredients, and the conditioner-whoa, talk about silky smooth hair!</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love - this is a great product!</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this product (even if it smells so gosh darn good), based on my experience.</li>
            <li>and I immediately can tell when a conditioner is good .&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good shampoo</li>
            <li>It is not as good as BedHead.  </li>
            <li>This is a good value for these products.</li>
            <li>This product does a good job taming it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them faithfully and loved the way they leave my hair.  </li>
            <li>so using Matrix helps me maintain my hair in good condition.</li>
            <li>I find it does a good job of keeping my hair from looking fried and leaves it fairly manageable.</li>
            <li>but it does a fair job of smoothing flyaways during styling.  </li>
            <li>Definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li>I have always loved this hair product, and will always use it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I found these products, my hair is loving me for it.</li>
            <li>So good for your hair and feel so good to.</li>
            <li>Healthy beautiful hair will result.</li>
            <li>Excellent product and quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Just what I always use, got here quickly and the perfect shampoo and conditioner for me</li>
            <li>Same day delivery was awesome, it&#x27;s a great product too!</li>
            <li>soon as I got some of this product out of the jar, which is a very huge jar !</li>
            <li>Very top of the line product buy it you&#x60;ll see.</li>
            <li>Love the smell!</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite shampoo ever!</li>

            <li>I get more compliments on my hair now and will never use another product!</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo and conditioner combo!</li>
            <li>it IS REAL, and the price- COME ON!!!!!</li>
            <li>it is an amazing silk conditioning balm.</li>
            <li>Amazing Product with an Amazing price point.</li>
            <li>This is a really good bundle deal as you will pay way more if you buy it in a store or salon.</li>
            <li>The conditioning balm is my favorite, I have yet to find a conditioner that works as good.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice.</li>
            <li>Leaves you with a nice shine, too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give it 5 stars except for the lack of a pump of any kind for the conditioner and that you have to purchase it separately for the shampoo.</li>
            <li>The shampoo smells nice without being perfumey or overpowering.</li>
            <li>My brother is kind of a... &amp;#34;hippie&amp;#34;?</li>
            <li>But anyways he barely washes his hair, its incredible beautiful and curly-</li>
            <li>THE CONDITIONER IS AWESOME THANKS</li>
            <li>My hair is kind of an oily/dry combo</li>
            <li>The hair looks spectacular.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Buy at your own risk...</li>
            <li>Love love love this shampoo!!</li>
            <li>It is absolutely fantastic â€“ keeps my hair healthy and shiny and smells really good!</li>
            <li>A worthy investment for beautiful hair.</li>
            <li>And of course, it all smells good but not too strong of a smell.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>I love the scent and my hair feels silky and healthy!</li>
            <li>, what nice surprise for he price, the texture was as described more of a balm.</li>
            <li>After a fresh hair cut this duo is great on my hair keeping it from being frizzy...</li>
            <li>This is by far the best shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Price is Cheaper and good quality, good packing and fast for shipping.</li>
            <li>I love love love the conditioning balm and love love love the smell!</li>
            <li>My husband and I both love it.  </li>
            <li>it looks like milk:)</li>
            <li>Love the scent and it&#x27;s better than lower end</li>
            <li>The Hydratherapie line is my favorite now.</li>
            <li>and I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this Biolage Hydratherapie hydrating duo.</li>
            <li>I love Matrix products and have been using it about 16 years now.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Biolage products</li>
            <li>I love this hair product.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and have used it for years.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad to find it.</li>
            <li>Top notch product.</li>
            <li>Im not too sure this product is authentic Biolage...</li>
            <li>It doesnt get better than this.</li>
            <li>I feel like every time i wash my hair, i am in a salon :)</li>
            <li>I was expecting a lot more from Matrix.  </li>
            <li>I love the conditioning balm.</li>
            <li>and I really love it.</li>
            <li>Love these products.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying both.</li>
            <li>Eliminates static and just makes my hair lay better and lighter.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Simply the best shampoo and conditioner you can buy.</li>
            <li>but this is a great deal because the conditioner alone costs almost as much as the set.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>hair look and feel better.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite lines of Shampoo and Conditioner.  </li>
            <li>My hair has never felt and looked better before.</li>
            <li>Love the shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>then I could have gotten a better deal saving $10.</li>
            <li>I feel like I was tricked into getting this product and paid out more than I should&#x27;ve.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and Balm for the hair.</li>
            <li>I have nothing more to say.</li>
            <li>I will not lie and say that during the actual shampoo/conditioning process in the shower I wasn&#x27;t extremely impressed</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m throwing out ALL of my cheap hair products!</li>
            <li>So, this product out lasts store bought shampoo by about 2 folds, maybe more.</li>
            <li>The longer you leave it in, the better it is for your hair.</li>
            <li>Now its smooth and Shiny!</li>
            <li>maybe i need to use more times to find out the effctive.</li>
            <li>I know everyone is different, but I love the hydration!!!</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling really clean and the smell is nice too.</li>
            <li>for the price, I normally use John Frieda, great product line, would however give their conditioner a 4 star and biolage 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but, unfortunately, not quite as good as I would have hoped.</li>
            <li>It contains silk amino acids, which will help to keep hair strong and healthy.</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner is very effective on any kind of hair, especially on damaged and/or color damaged hair.  </li>
            <li>I got this package for $25 which is a really good price for this brand and the size is large.</li>
            <li>This makes my hair feel great, no greasy feeling, just moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful product and smells great for Male or Female.</li>
            <li>I really loved this product as much as the Surface product.</li>
            <li>they said this product is really good, the shompoo just really hydrated</li>
            <li>Conditioner feels very rich and smooth in texture, however, it does not leave hair greasy.</li>
            <li>: Smells fantastic, large bottle and tub with lots of product, good lather and rinses</li>
            <li>I can run my fingers through it easily.</li>
            <li>SHAMPOO - Hands down the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>You really dont need much to wash your hair which is awesome because it&#x27;ll last longer which is good for the money in your pockets.</li>
            <li>I like that this shampoo and conditioner clean my hair and leave it shiny and easy to control; curly hair is not that easy to control</li>
            <li>I am really picky about my conditioners, I like them to be very rich and creamy and this is!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of the Biolage products.</li>
            <li>The Conditioning balm is fantastic and hydrates the hair and makes it shiny.</li>
            <li>My hair is smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic products...</li>
            <li>My hair feels so silky smooth after using the balm.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great price on Amazon, plus the convenience of having it delivered means I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li>I was almost out of conditioner and discovered they were no longer available at my salon, so checked on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>And the online prices are fantastic.</li>
            <li>but if I wasn&#x27;t so cheap I would probably go for a product like aveda.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing I have noticed so much difference in my hair, I truly recommended to use this product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years and it works great for me.  </li>
            <li>I wash/dry &amp; straighten it everyday and it always looks great!</li>
            <li>it is a great product and i will definitely be ordering it again when i need it!</li>
            <li>They need to make them in bigger sizes, lol.</li>
            <li>Spend the extra dough and get this great system.</li>
            <li>Great product have used before and will reorder again in the future.</li>
            <li>If you have to deal with brittle hair, frequently coloring, this is a good product.</li>
            <li>The shampoo lathers really good and moisturizes and nourishes your hair and the conditioning balm detangles and makes your hair so soft.</li>
            <li>Has such a clean great smell.</li>
            <li>These products smell great too, light fragrance but enough to make your hair smell fresh and clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li>When you can get 2 for $30, it&#x27;s worth the buy!</li>
            <li>I have been using these products for more than 20 years and they have never failed me.</li>
            <li>but honestly I like the balm better than regular bottled conditioner.</li>
            <li>When you rinse it out your hair feel nice and soft and shiny and tangle free.</li>
            <li>This keeps my hair nice and soft!</li>
            <li>Thanks biolage, beautiful hair is possible!!!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is a balm, so it is conditioing the hair much deeper</li>
            <li>I love Biolage products and they are so gentle on the hair.  </li>
            <li>Best product for thick hair.</li>
            <li>love this product and it came to me fast.</li>
            <li>That is why I love this product so much.</li>
            <li>I HAVE to use a straight iron because of the frizz which dries my hair out even more.  </li>
            <li>The true test was sleeping.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell of both products are nicely, simply clean, fresh, but not overpowering like purology.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair and have to wash it daily or it becomes a grease pit and this duo keeps my happy and healthy.  </li>
            <li>It also smells clean and fresh without being perfumey.</li>
            <li>It does a good job on my dry hair , it does clean and I like the way my hair smells</li>
            <li>Quick shipping though.</li>
            <li>As for the deep conditioner, this is probably one of the best deep conditioners I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and in tact.</li>
            <li>I dye my hair time from time a brunette, and the color holds up great; especially for a shampoo and conditioner system that doesn&#x27;t concentrate on color treated hair in particular.</li>
            <li>Was looking for a new shampoo and decided to check Amazon for top reviewed ones.</li>
            <li>This is a great duo of salon-quality products at about half the cost of retail.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair so pretty!</li>
            <li>The Hydrotherapie brand by Biolage is exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>Dove used to be my favorite, and before highlighting/dying my hair it did a superb job, but afterward chemical processes I had dry hair with very tangled and dry split ends!</li>
            <li>Works well on my fine, straight, sometimes oily hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is amazing and it&#x27;s only been one day.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner leave my hair feeling soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>Took a bit of time to ship, but was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>I like that it is not crazy on suds...</li>
            <li>My hair is now soft, shiny &amp; healthy.</li>
            <li>well worth the money for this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I love the conditioning balm, I have long hair that tangles easily</li>
            <li>If you have a shampoo you already love but maybe need a little more moisture for your hair, than these products might be worth a try.</li>
            <li>Shampoo, it lathers up nicely with like 2 pumps for my long hair, I got the pump for it as the bottle is huge!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I still have to put other product in my hair to control the curl and frizz, but this does a good job for the first part of the process.</li>
            <li>My hair comes out clean, soft and full.</li>
            <li>So I decided to break down and try a good *salon* product,:</li>
            <li>I know 30 bucks seems a bit pricey, but the products are large in quantity and given the results, 30 bucks feels like a bargain!</li>
            <li>It makes my hair shiny soft and easy to manage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was very satisfactory as well as very fast shipping!</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much to get a good lather, not like other shampoos.</li>
            <li>It is also a great value since it is such a large size, it will last quite a while.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair feeling so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>My hair salon only brings these duos out a couple times a year, so I was quite pleased to find the product on Amazon whenever I want it.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and shiny and tangle free.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time using the hydrating line as I use the strengthening</li>
            <li>and I have to say that the hydrating is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>It worked well for the first week</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m finally learning this :)</li>
            <li>My personal favorite.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t need much at all!</li>
            <li>They promote healthy hair for people like me that use a flat iron and curling iron.</li>
            <li>all positive.</li>
            <li>Have used it for a long time and my hair is healthy.  </li>
            <li>With regular use and using my other in hair curl defining cream, it makes my hair feel awesome for the entire work day and into the evening...</li>
            <li>Very little shampoo is needed for a good lather and the conditioner has really maintained the strength &amp; softness of my hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is super soft since I started using this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Nice product, wish it was less pricey.</li>
            <li>and I took it for pure amusement.</li>
            <li>Hydrating shampoo is really astringent., not hydrating at all.</li>
            <li>Really hydrates the hair.</li>
            <li>really wanted to like this set...</li>
            <li>I also really like the smell of both.</li>
            <li>covered my whole hair.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>and it did absolutely nothing for my hair</li>
            <li>(yes I am a guy) and these products really are miraculous.</li>
            <li>It cleans hair wihout drying it out and it really does moisturize the hair.</li>
            <li>My Hair Responds Very Well To The Shampoo And conditioner.</li>
            <li>and I am very picky</li>
            <li>It says to use it every 2 or 3 days I think, but I use it every day, I just try not to use too much at a time</li>
            <li>Conditioner tangles hair very well :|</li>
            <li>The two products work together very well.  </li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>I really liked.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>I have not found these products to provide any type of intense hydrating to my hair or scalp.  </li>
            <li>so I know its really working.</li>
            <li>THANKS  </li>
            <li>The shampoo is gentle and the conditioning balm moisturizes and eliminates fly-away &amp; tangles.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t strip hair as it cleanses, so you can really scrub up without worrying that your hair will feel like straw afterwards.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really helps define my curls and gives me a lift, where as this set helps it go straight.</li>
            <li>I bought the real products from a store</li>
            <li>conditioner is a real loser.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>My hair was moisturized very well.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never considered spending so much on shampoo and conditioner before.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>am not sure how well the shampoo is hydrating, for me I always think the conditioner is key to beautiful , silky , shiny hair.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I have tried SO many different kinds of conditioners that will de-tangle my hair and make it soft</li>
            <li>This pair is good for thick hair.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s always my favorite after I try other brands.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend to anyone wanting to try it out, it is worth the money!</li>
            <li>some people in this household love it, some other people like me dont.</li>
            <li>The shampoo works like any other, but the conditioning balm is so absolutely fantastic!</li>
            <li>The only problem I have had is that after repeated use, it doesn&#x27;t seem to clean the hair as well.</li>
            <li>I recommend anyone to try this line if you have dry and easily tangled hair.</li>
            <li>I wish it smelled better, not that it smells bad, just that I love strong smelling hair products.</li>
            <li>The down side is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to CLEAN my hair very well which, lets face it, is the reason for shampooing in the first place!</li>
            <li>I have fine, dry hair and need shampoo and conditioner that don&#x27;t make my hair feel stringy after using it.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Matrix brand (a little cheaper than their Biolage line and exactly the same I think) for volumizing and I love it!</li>
            <li>but completely new and wrapped as a pack!</li>
            <li>If you live in a town where you have to travel to get this...here is your solution!</li>
            <li>I am Irish-Italian with dark brown, healthy, natural hair (not colored), straight and not thin, not</li>
            <li>I always use this shampoo and buy it from amazon not just for convenience but also for the decent price.</li>
            <li>works very well, though, makes my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these products.</li>
            <li>and I can just highly recommend for you to try</li>
            <li>Highly recommend if you have color treated hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>After trying to avoid paying a &#x27;high price&#x27; and picking tresame or organix...I sucked it up, listend to my stylist and bought this.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works to moisturize and keep my natural waves in.</li>
            <li>and After reading hair specialist reviews and suggestions on a good hair system for dry/damaged hair, I bought the small sized bottles of this at my local grocery store.</li>
            <li>This is the same quality, same product I get from the salon at a far better price.</li>
            <li>These worked great to restore moisture, shine, and softness to my dry, dull, and brittle hair.</li>
            <li>NOT AT ALL, when my hair was dry, it was feather light weight and so soft to touch.</li>
            <li>Naturally, my hair is very smooth and with a little hair serum it feels like silk.</li>
            <li>after I shampoo I squeeze the water out of my hair and apply a quarter size ( i have super long hair) amount of conditioner to my hair</li>
            <li>I have thick fine hair and have used their sleek products for the past two years, loved them but wanted to try something new.  </li>
            <li>It did all the same things for my hair that Surface did and is a little more budget friendly, it is also easier to buy locally</li>
            <li>I was pleased to find the same size (large) combo and at a lower cost than I had paid previously.  </li>
            <li>It is also super moisturizing and hydrates my long locks!</li>
            <li>The extra moisture has allowed me to grow my hair out this past year and have it look very healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many (cheap and expensive) and have never found one</li>
            <li>yikes).I also have no thyroid so that makes my hair super dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li>super dry and straw-like but not since I&#x27;ve started using this conditioning balm.</li>
            <li>It is just okay, I am not completely in love with it</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel so soft!</li>
            <li>(p.s I also sprayed a tad of Miracle 7 veal in mist, from Sally&#x27;s on my ends as I usually do and that makes it even better)</li>
            <li>The shampoo might be ok (hard to tell since you use the conditioner right after) but the conditioning balm actually dries my hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, it magically doesn&#x27;t deposit a ton of extra oils to weigh down my hair.  </li>
            <li>It was very smooth with hardly any frizz.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been in search of the right shampoo and conditioner for my dry hair.</li>
            <li>have fine limp hair and this gives me the body my hair needs along with the shine.</li>
            <li>A couple days later, I decided to try it out - again, for pure amusement.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t bare to pay so highly for hair care.</li>
            <li>Compared to other products especially those in a jar, which make it easy to get out and put in your hair</li>
            <li>My hair is instantly repaired and so so much softer and healthier.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>As much as I like to patronize my local hair salon, these prices on Amazon cannot be beat.  </li>
            <li>Now my hair is soft again.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m naturally curly</li>
            <li>Oh wow</li>
            <li>My hair is soft shiny hydrated and doesn&#x27;t tangle.</li>
            <li>Biolage makes my hair manageable and soft again.</li>
            <li>I wonder if old product is to blame here...</li>
            <li>shampoo rinsed out COMPLETELY -</li>
            <li>It worked immediately and makes your hair sooo soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I never could understand why products that boast about hydration and the end of dry hair would have alcohol within the first five ingredients listed.</li>
            <li>but I have been lucky so far with my previous Biolage purchases.</li>
            <li>They will last a long time and be well worth your money in the end.</li>
            <li>Instead of a silky smooth sort of feel, my hair felt rough and very very dry.</li>
            <li>I decided to spend a little extra on what I thought would be a fantastic, hydrating hair washing set.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out at all and detangles really well.</li>
            <li>My hair has suffered a year and half worth of heat, chemicals and color treatments.</li>
            <li>It definitely left my ends very soft &amp; healthier.</li>
            <li>This is a larger version of the small bottles sold in hair salons and an occasional pharmacy (a much better deal too).</li>
            <li>My very long, fine, thin hair was pretty damaged from laying in a hospital bed for a while after surgery and a period of recovery.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft and manageable after only one use!</li>
            <li>Hair is so soft the next day.</li>
            <li>and I was using a normal conditioner and gets dry.</li>
            <li>This is about half of what I pay in my salon for these exact products.  </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t recommend it enough to people who have dry, brittle, overprocessed hair!</li>
            <li>I can really feel and see the difference with Biolage vs other shampoos.</li>
            <li>I have been using Nexxus for a long time but just finally wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li>The balm has no scent and will weigh down hair if you use too much.</li>
            <li>My hair is dryer than ever and is frizzy beyond belief if I let it dry naturally.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and thick and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I spent almost $100 on a new Paul Mitchell shampoo and conditioner and have recently found myself breaking opening up my Biologe DUO.</li>
            <li>I ordered some from Amazon and my dry, coarse, curly hair has been soft and bouncy.  </li>
            <li>My hair stylist recommended this for me when I flat iron my hair and the deep conditioner in general.</li>
            <li>I never wanted to resort to overly expensive shampoos, but this product is so great, especially if you have hard water.</li>

            <li> What&#x27;s not to love - this is a great product!</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product (even if it smells so gosh darn good), based on my experience.</li>
            <li> and I immediately can tell when a conditioner is good .&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good shampoo</li>
            <li> It is not as good as BedHead.  </li>
            <li> This is a good value for these products.</li>
            <li> This product does a good job taming it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them faithfully and loved the way they leave my hair.  </li>
            <li> so using Matrix helps me maintain my hair in good condition.</li>
            <li> I find it does a good job of keeping my hair from looking fried and leaves it fairly manageable.</li>
            <li> but it does a fair job of smoothing flyaways during styling.  </li>
            <li> Definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this hair product, and will always use it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I found these products, my hair is loving me for it.</li>
            <li> So good for your hair and feel so good to.</li>
            <li> Healthy beautiful hair will result.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Just what I always use, got here quickly and the perfect shampoo and conditioner for me</li>
            <li> Same day delivery was awesome, it&#x27;s a great product too!</li>
            <li> soon as I got some of this product out of the jar, which is a very huge jar !</li>
            <li> Very top of the line product buy it you&#x60;ll see.</li>
            <li> Love the smell!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!</li>

            <li> it IS REAL, and the price- COME ON!!!!!</li>
            <li> it is an amazing silk conditioning balm.</li>
            <li> Amazing Product with an Amazing price point.</li>
            <li> This is a really good bundle deal as you will pay way more if you buy it in a store or salon.</li>
            <li> The conditioning balm is my favorite, I have yet to find a conditioner that works as good.</li>
            <li> The scent is nice.</li>
            <li> Leaves you with a nice shine, too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it 5 stars except for the lack of a pump of any kind for the conditioner and that you have to purchase it separately for the shampoo.</li>
            <li> The shampoo smells nice without being perfumey or overpowering.</li>
            <li> My brother is kind of a... &amp;#34;hippie&amp;#34;?</li>
            <li> But anyways he barely washes his hair, its incredible beautiful and curly-</li>
            <li> THE CONDITIONER IS AWESOME THANKS</li>
            <li> My hair is kind of an oily/dry combo</li>
            <li> The hair looks spectacular.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Buy at your own risk...</li>
            <li> Love love love this shampoo!!</li>
            <li> It is absolutely fantastic â€“ keeps my hair healthy and shiny and smells really good!</li>
            <li> A worthy investment for beautiful hair.</li>
            <li> And of course, it all smells good but not too strong of a smell.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> I love the scent and my hair feels silky and healthy!</li>
            <li> , what nice surprise for he price, the texture was as described more of a balm.</li>
            <li> After a fresh hair cut this duo is great on my hair keeping it from being frizzy...</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Price is Cheaper and good quality, good packing and fast for shipping.</li>
            <li> I love love love the conditioning balm and love love love the smell!</li>
            <li> My husband and I both love it.  </li>
            <li> it looks like milk:)</li>
            <li> Love the scent and it&#x27;s better than lower end</li>
            <li> The Hydratherapie line is my favorite now.</li>

            <li> It doesnt get better than this.</li>
            <li> I feel like every time i wash my hair, i am in a salon :)</li>
            <li> I was expecting a lot more from Matrix.  </li>
            <li> I love the conditioning balm.</li>
            <li> and I really love it.</li>
            <li> Love these products.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying both.</li>
            <li> Eliminates static and just makes my hair lay better and lighter.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Simply the best shampoo and conditioner you can buy.</li>
            <li> but this is a great deal because the conditioner alone costs almost as much as the set.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> hair look and feel better.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite lines of Shampoo and Conditioner.  </li>
            <li> My hair has never felt and looked better before.</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> then I could have gotten a better deal saving $10.</li>
            <li> I feel like I was tricked into getting this product and paid out more than I should&#x27;ve.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and Balm for the hair.</li>
            <li> I have nothing more to say.</li>
            <li> I will not lie and say that during the actual shampoo/conditioning process in the shower I wasn&#x27;t extremely impressed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m throwing out ALL of my cheap hair products!</li>
            <li> So, this product out lasts store bought shampoo by about 2 folds, maybe more.</li>
            <li> The longer you leave it in, the better it is for your hair.</li>
            <li> Now its smooth and Shiny!</li>
            <li> maybe i need to use more times to find out the effctive.</li>
            <li> I know everyone is different, but I love the hydration!!!</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling really clean and the smell is nice too.</li>
            <li> for the price, I normally use John Frieda, great product line, would however give their conditioner a 4 star and biolage 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but, unfortunately, not quite as good as I would have hoped.</li>
            <li> It contains silk amino acids, which will help to keep hair strong and healthy.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is very effective on any kind of hair, especially on damaged and/or color damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> I got this package for $25 which is a really good price for this brand and the size is large.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair feel great, no greasy feeling, just moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful product and smells great for Male or Female.</li>
            <li> I really loved this product as much as the Surface product.</li>
            <li> they said this product is really good, the shompoo just really hydrated</li>
            <li> Conditioner feels very rich and smooth in texture, however, it does not leave hair greasy.</li>
            <li> : Smells fantastic, large bottle and tub with lots of product, good lather and rinses</li>
            <li> I can run my fingers through it easily.</li>
            <li> SHAMPOO - Hands down the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> You really dont need much to wash your hair which is awesome because it&#x27;ll last longer which is good for the money in your pockets.</li>
            <li> I like that this shampoo and conditioner clean my hair and leave it shiny and easy to control; curly hair is not that easy to control</li>
            <li> I am really picky about my conditioners, I like them to be very rich and creamy and this is!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of the Biolage products.</li>
            <li> The Conditioning balm is fantastic and hydrates the hair and makes it shiny.</li>
            <li> My hair is smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic products...</li>
            <li> My hair feels so silky smooth after using the balm.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great price on Amazon, plus the convenience of having it delivered means I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I was almost out of conditioner and discovered they were no longer available at my salon, so checked on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> And the online prices are fantastic.</li>
            <li> but if I wasn&#x27;t so cheap I would probably go for a product like aveda.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing I have noticed so much difference in my hair, I truly recommended to use this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years and it works great for me.  </li>
            <li> I wash/dry &amp; straighten it everyday and it always looks great!</li>
            <li> it is a great product and i will definitely be ordering it again when i need it!</li>
            <li> They need to make them in bigger sizes, lol.</li>
            <li> Spend the extra dough and get this great system.</li>
            <li> Great product have used before and will reorder again in the future.</li>
            <li> If you have to deal with brittle hair, frequently coloring, this is a good product.</li>
            <li> The shampoo lathers really good and moisturizes and nourishes your hair and the conditioning balm detangles and makes your hair so soft.</li>
            <li> Has such a clean great smell.</li>
            <li> These products smell great too, light fragrance but enough to make your hair smell fresh and clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li> When you can get 2 for $30, it&#x27;s worth the buy!</li>
            <li> I have been using these products for more than 20 years and they have never failed me.</li>
            <li> but honestly I like the balm better than regular bottled conditioner.</li>
            <li> When you rinse it out your hair feel nice and soft and shiny and tangle free.</li>
            <li> This keeps my hair nice and soft!</li>
            <li> Thanks biolage, beautiful hair is possible!!!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is a balm, so it is conditioing the hair much deeper</li>
            <li> I love Biolage products and they are so gentle on the hair.  </li>
            <li> Best product for thick hair.</li>
            <li> love this product and it came to me fast.</li>
            <li> That is why I love this product so much.</li>
            <li> I HAVE to use a straight iron because of the frizz which dries my hair out even more.  </li>
            <li> The true test was sleeping.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell of both products are nicely, simply clean, fresh, but not overpowering like purology.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair and have to wash it daily or it becomes a grease pit and this duo keeps my happy and healthy.  </li>
            <li> It also smells clean and fresh without being perfumey.</li>
            <li> It does a good job on my dry hair , it does clean and I like the way my hair smells</li>
            <li> Quick shipping though.</li>
            <li> As for the deep conditioner, this is probably one of the best deep conditioners I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and in tact.</li>
            <li> I dye my hair time from time a brunette, and the color holds up great; especially for a shampoo and conditioner system that doesn&#x27;t concentrate on color treated hair in particular.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a new shampoo and decided to check Amazon for top reviewed ones.</li>
            <li> This is a great duo of salon-quality products at about half the cost of retail.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so pretty!</li>
            <li> The Hydrotherapie brand by Biolage is exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> Dove used to be my favorite, and before highlighting/dying my hair it did a superb job, but afterward chemical processes I had dry hair with very tangled and dry split ends!</li>
            <li> Works well on my fine, straight, sometimes oily hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is amazing and it&#x27;s only been one day.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner leave my hair feeling soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> Took a bit of time to ship, but was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> I like that it is not crazy on suds...</li>
            <li> My hair is now soft, shiny &amp; healthy.</li>
            <li> well worth the money for this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I love the conditioning balm, I have long hair that tangles easily</li>
            <li> If you have a shampoo you already love but maybe need a little more moisture for your hair, than these products might be worth a try.</li>
            <li> Shampoo, it lathers up nicely with like 2 pumps for my long hair, I got the pump for it as the bottle is huge!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still have to put other product in my hair to control the curl and frizz, but this does a good job for the first part of the process.</li>
            <li> My hair comes out clean, soft and full.</li>
            <li> So I decided to break down and try a good *salon* product,:</li>
            <li> I know 30 bucks seems a bit pricey, but the products are large in quantity and given the results, 30 bucks feels like a bargain!</li>
            <li> It makes my hair shiny soft and easy to manage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was very satisfactory as well as very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much to get a good lather, not like other shampoos.</li>
            <li> It is also a great value since it is such a large size, it will last quite a while.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair feeling so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> My hair salon only brings these duos out a couple times a year, so I was quite pleased to find the product on Amazon whenever I want it.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and shiny and tangle free.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time using the hydrating line as I use the strengthening</li>
            <li> and I have to say that the hydrating is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> It worked well for the first week</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finally learning this :)</li>
            <li> My personal favorite.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t need much at all!</li>
            <li> They promote healthy hair for people like me that use a flat iron and curling iron.</li>
            <li> all positive.</li>
            <li> Have used it for a long time and my hair is healthy.  </li>
            <li> With regular use and using my other in hair curl defining cream, it makes my hair feel awesome for the entire work day and into the evening...</li>
            <li> Very little shampoo is needed for a good lather and the conditioner has really maintained the strength &amp; softness of my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is super soft since I started using this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Nice product, wish it was less pricey.</li>
            <li> and I took it for pure amusement.</li>
            <li> Hydrating shampoo is really astringent., not hydrating at all.</li>
            <li> Really hydrates the hair.</li>
            <li> really wanted to like this set...</li>
            <li> I also really like the smell of both.</li>
            <li> covered my whole hair.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> and it did absolutely nothing for my hair</li>
            <li> (yes I am a guy) and these products really are miraculous.</li>
            <li> It cleans hair wihout drying it out and it really does moisturize the hair.</li>
            <li> My Hair Responds Very Well To The Shampoo And conditioner.</li>
            <li> and I am very picky</li>
            <li> It says to use it every 2 or 3 days I think, but I use it every day, I just try not to use too much at a time</li>
            <li> Conditioner tangles hair very well :|</li>
            <li> The two products work together very well.  </li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> I really liked.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> I have not found these products to provide any type of intense hydrating to my hair or scalp.  </li>
            <li> so I know its really working.</li>
            <li> THANKS  </li>
            <li> The shampoo is gentle and the conditioning balm moisturizes and eliminates fly-away &amp; tangles.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t strip hair as it cleanses, so you can really scrub up without worrying that your hair will feel like straw afterwards.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really helps define my curls and gives me a lift, where as this set helps it go straight.</li>
            <li> I bought the real products from a store</li>
            <li> conditioner is a real loser.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> My hair was moisturized very well.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never considered spending so much on shampoo and conditioner before.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> am not sure how well the shampoo is hydrating, for me I always think the conditioner is key to beautiful , silky , shiny hair.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I have tried SO many different kinds of conditioners that will de-tangle my hair and make it soft</li>
            <li> This pair is good for thick hair.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s always my favorite after I try other brands.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend to anyone wanting to try it out, it is worth the money!</li>
            <li> some people in this household love it, some other people like me dont.</li>
            <li> The shampoo works like any other, but the conditioning balm is so absolutely fantastic!</li>
            <li> The only problem I have had is that after repeated use, it doesn&#x27;t seem to clean the hair as well.</li>
            <li> I recommend anyone to try this line if you have dry and easily tangled hair.</li>
            <li> I wish it smelled better, not that it smells bad, just that I love strong smelling hair products.</li>
            <li> The down side is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to CLEAN my hair very well which, lets face it, is the reason for shampooing in the first place!</li>
            <li> I have fine, dry hair and need shampoo and conditioner that don&#x27;t make my hair feel stringy after using it.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Matrix brand (a little cheaper than their Biolage line and exactly the same I think) for volumizing and I love it!</li>
            <li> but completely new and wrapped as a pack!</li>
            <li> If you live in a town where you have to travel to get this...here is your solution!</li>
            <li> I am Irish-Italian with dark brown, healthy, natural hair (not colored), straight and not thin, not</li>
            <li> I always use this shampoo and buy it from amazon not just for convenience but also for the decent price.</li>
            <li> works very well, though, makes my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these products.</li>
            <li> and I can just highly recommend for you to try</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you have color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> After trying to avoid paying a &#x27;high price&#x27; and picking tresame or organix...I sucked it up, listend to my stylist and bought this.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works to moisturize and keep my natural waves in.</li>
            <li> and After reading hair specialist reviews and suggestions on a good hair system for dry/damaged hair, I bought the small sized bottles of this at my local grocery store.</li>
            <li> This is the same quality, same product I get from the salon at a far better price.</li>
            <li> These worked great to restore moisture, shine, and softness to my dry, dull, and brittle hair.</li>
            <li> NOT AT ALL, when my hair was dry, it was feather light weight and so soft to touch.</li>
            <li> Naturally, my hair is very smooth and with a little hair serum it feels like silk.</li>
            <li> after I shampoo I squeeze the water out of my hair and apply a quarter size ( i have super long hair) amount of conditioner to my hair</li>
            <li> I have thick fine hair and have used their sleek products for the past two years, loved them but wanted to try something new.  </li>
            <li> It did all the same things for my hair that Surface did and is a little more budget friendly, it is also easier to buy locally</li>
            <li> I was pleased to find the same size (large) combo and at a lower cost than I had paid previously.  </li>
            <li> It is also super moisturizing and hydrates my long locks!</li>
            <li> The extra moisture has allowed me to grow my hair out this past year and have it look very healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many (cheap and expensive) and have never found one</li>
            <li> yikes).I also have no thyroid so that makes my hair super dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li> super dry and straw-like but not since I&#x27;ve started using this conditioning balm.</li>
            <li> It is just okay, I am not completely in love with it</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel so soft!</li>
            <li> (p.s I also sprayed a tad of Miracle 7 veal in mist, from Sally&#x27;s on my ends as I usually do and that makes it even better)</li>
            <li> The shampoo might be ok (hard to tell since you use the conditioner right after) but the conditioning balm actually dries my hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, it magically doesn&#x27;t deposit a ton of extra oils to weigh down my hair.  </li>
            <li> It was very smooth with hardly any frizz.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been in search of the right shampoo and conditioner for my dry hair.</li>
            <li> have fine limp hair and this gives me the body my hair needs along with the shine.</li>
            <li> A couple days later, I decided to try it out - again, for pure amusement.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t bare to pay so highly for hair care.</li>
            <li> Compared to other products especially those in a jar, which make it easy to get out and put in your hair</li>
            <li> My hair is instantly repaired and so so much softer and healthier.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> As much as I like to patronize my local hair salon, these prices on Amazon cannot be beat.  </li>
            <li> Now my hair is soft again.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m naturally curly</li>
            <li> Oh wow</li>
            <li> My hair is soft shiny hydrated and doesn&#x27;t tangle.</li>
            <li> Biolage makes my hair manageable and soft again.</li>
            <li> I wonder if old product is to blame here...</li>
            <li> shampoo rinsed out COMPLETELY -</li>
            <li> It worked immediately and makes your hair sooo soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I never could understand why products that boast about hydration and the end of dry hair would have alcohol within the first five ingredients listed.</li>
            <li> but I have been lucky so far with my previous Biolage purchases.</li>
            <li> They will last a long time and be well worth your money in the end.</li>
            <li> Instead of a silky smooth sort of feel, my hair felt rough and very very dry.</li>
            <li> I decided to spend a little extra on what I thought would be a fantastic, hydrating hair washing set.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out at all and detangles really well.</li>
            <li> My hair has suffered a year and half worth of heat, chemicals and color treatments.</li>
            <li> It definitely left my ends very soft &amp; healthier.</li>
            <li> This is a larger version of the small bottles sold in hair salons and an occasional pharmacy (a much better deal too).</li>
            <li> My very long, fine, thin hair was pretty damaged from laying in a hospital bed for a while after surgery and a period of recovery.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so soft and manageable after only one use!</li>
            <li> Hair is so soft the next day.</li>
            <li> and I was using a normal conditioner and gets dry.</li>
            <li> This is about half of what I pay in my salon for these exact products.  </li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t recommend it enough to people who have dry, brittle, overprocessed hair!</li>
            <li> I can really feel and see the difference with Biolage vs other shampoos.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nexxus for a long time but just finally wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li> The balm has no scent and will weigh down hair if you use too much.</li>
            <li> My hair is dryer than ever and is frizzy beyond belief if I let it dry naturally.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and thick and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I spent almost $100 on a new Paul Mitchell shampoo and conditioner and have recently found myself breaking opening up my Biologe DUO.</li>
            <li> I ordered some from Amazon and my dry, coarse, curly hair has been soft and bouncy.  </li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended this for me when I flat iron my hair and the deep conditioner in general.</li>
            <li> I never wanted to resort to overly expensive shampoos, but this product is so great, especially if you have hard water.</li>
            <li> the price for this is worth it for the big shampoo bottle alone, but the balm should last a very long time, as it is only needed 2x a week and very little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> the shampoo wasn&#x27;t suppose to weigh your hair down but it did the complete opposite.</li>
            <li> I feared that since this set is the &#x27;conditioning&#x27;, it would leave my hair flat and greasy.</li>
            <li> I always have problems with my hair drying out because I highlight it and use a flat iron every day.  </li>
            <li> I leave it in as long as I possibly can.</li>
            <li> This shampoo/conditioner leaves my hair soft and silky down to the ends, without drying it out and making it oily.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo and conditioner I can use that doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.  </li>
            <li> this shampoo and conditioning balm, I didn&#x27;t have to put any extra product in my hair after it was dry.</li>
            <li> of three times a few months ago, and I swear I have these products to thank for my soft hair today!  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m blonde but had a period of black hair and went back blonde after that..</li>
            <li> It helps my split ends better than in store brands too, keeps them from going in all crazy directions.</li>
            <li> Came earlier than expected and as described.</li>
            <li> it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have long hair (down to mid back)</li>
            <li> I have coarse, thick, curly hair and live in the south.</li>
            <li> I may stray and try other products, but I always come back to Biolage.</li>
            <li> I try other shampoos but keep coming back to the Biolage hydrating shampoo.</li>
            <li> actually i viewed other people&#x27;s commends.</li>
            <li> I have dry curly hair and this stuff is my go -to shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I color my hair, so my roots get greasy and my ends are dry, but this shampoo and conditioner has helped.</li>
            <li> The shampoo tends to dry my hair out, though</li>
            <li> the days I just let my hair air dry this product pulls through.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of product and blow dry often, but this shampoo keeps away buildup and keeps it from drying out.</li>
            <li> yes, even in the winter my hair gets frizzy...and dry from the air...</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair dry.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for those of you have dry hair.</li>
            <li> My hair tend to be dry and brittle from color processing, the blow dryer, curling iron, etc.  </li>
            <li> moisturized my dry hair.</li>
            <li> To blow dry and straighten my hair, it used to take 2 hours.</li>
            <li> Leave the conditioner on longer to restore damaged dry hair.</li>
            <li> , i feel dry when i wash off.</li>
            <li> I have over-processed hair that is dry and broken and after using this shampoo for a while I can really tell the difference!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other shampoos over the years (trying to save money) and have never liked anything as much.</li>
            <li> No more half used bottles or stuff that doesn&#x27;t so anything for me, no more searching the shampoo aisle for the next brand that will make my hair look like a models, I found them and it&#x27;s worth the price, you only need a little bit of product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna return my small bottles and just buy this combo set since I payed the same amount for the smaller set at my grocery store!</li>
            <li> I have thyroid disease and my hair tends to be very dry</li>
            <li> I use this combo everyday; although once a week I use an intensive deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> : Not very hydrating for me.</li>
            <li> It came quicker than I expected...</li>
            <li> The Shampoo was 1/4 empty and the jar of balm was also about 1/3 used.  </li>
            <li> I am so upset that I spent this money.</li>
            <li> My hair was feeling thick, coarse, frizzy, and was simply unmanageable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using both products almost everyday for the past 2 weeks now, and all of the issues stated before are completely gone.</li>
            <li> I normally use expensive products such as Bumble &amp; Bumble or Paul Mitchell.  </li>
            <li> but it made my hair feel dry and like straw, unlike any Biolage products I have used previously.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way on the Shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> When I usually do my hair, I dry it then have to put extra product in it to tame the frizz, then dry it again.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> I use other products when straightening).     </li>
            <li> Stopped using it and went back to my usual sham/cond.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Biolage products, but have been disappointed in this set.  </li>
            <li> i dont know what is the difference from other cheaper shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Matrix Biolage is the only formula I have found that hydrates my hair without making it heavy and limp.  </li>
            <li> it gets my hair back to feeling &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; (even after being thoroughly rinsed after applying) but doesn&#x27;t make it look limp, heavy, or greasy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The conditioner with this set is a once or twice a week use because it&#x27;s a deep conditioner, you would need to purchase the everyday conditioner for everyday use</li>
            <li> it makes my hair more dry and feels not soft at all, it was horrible dry feeling.</li>
            <li> Usually when I wake up my hair has dried out immensely while I&#x27;ve slept, but not with this biolage system!</li>
            <li> The conditioning balm is unlike any conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used - it&#x27;s thick and definitely coated my hair how I needed it to.</li>
            <li> Hydrates doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li> It does not weigh your hair down</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down or make it greasy.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy or weighed down.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes hair down to the ends.</li>
            <li> My hair looks weighed down.  </li>
            <li> is not worthy the price.</li>
            <li> a jet black</li>
            <li> For some reason this makes my hair super tangled, like impossible to comb through.  </li>
            <li> Holy cow!</li>
            <li> there is a reason Biolage is an expensive shampoo ...would definitely recommend and within a month you&#x27;ll definitely see a difference in your hair.. would recommend for all hair types</li>
            <li> and while I don&#x27;t color it, or use an excessive amount of product or heat, the ends can get very dry and damaged.</li>
            <li> My hair has been a mess since I highlighted my hair...</li>
            <li> It usually is very expensive, but the price was right....</li>
            <li> and I thought my hair would still be dry and icky after towel drying it.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick but tends to be dry at the ends and prone to split ends.</li>
            <li> I have thick, fairly dry hair from blow drying and straightening.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and dry.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried that they would be opened or watered down since so inexpensive!</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start out by saying - my hair is very, very frizzy and very difficult to</li>
            <li> doing the math behind the volume of the big bottle vs. buying John Frieda which is I think about 8 oz.</li>
            <li> I straighten my hair almost everyday</li>
            <li> I do use this everyday and my hair does not appear to be damaged, even though I&#x27;m applying heat to it everyday.</li>
            <li> Moisturizing with out being heavy or greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> They shipped in just a few days, too.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it dried my hair out after two weeks.  </li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t go to waste.</li>
            <li> Since using them I have noticed a slight improvement in the moisture of my hair and it does feel softer than usual.</li>
            <li> I have thin limp long hair.  </li>
            <li> ( No drugstore shampoo/conditioner did much but make my hair feel greasy and weighed down :(</li>
            <li> JUST AS EXPECTED!!!!</li>
            <li> My hair is usually wavy, my hair get frizzy on humid or rainy days.</li>
            <li> , I blow-dried my hair using my diffuser to make it curly like I usually do.</li>
            <li> These products are usually $18-22 a piece at the store I usually go to, so I was stoked to see them in a $25 bundle!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m set for at least a year.</li>
            <li> I recommend getting the 33.8oz shampoo pump, but do NOT get the pump for the conditioner, it does not pick up the thick conditioner.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a less expensive alternative.  </li>
            <li> but im a little bit disappointed because it just like other shampoo</li>
            <li> (This may be heavy for someone with very thin hair that needs volume).</li>
            <li> The balm is not a great rinse out conditioner</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s done wonders for my thin, damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a shampoo/conditioner that would fix my unhealthy hair.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair, but a lot of it.</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt this dry:(</li>
            <li> It weighs down my hair and makes styling impossible.  </li>
            <li> I think it is disgusting to package this to &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; like a new product and then cheat your customers!</li>
            <li> I usually leave it on for about 5 minutes and rinse with cold water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a distance swimmer and spend about 2.5 hours in a chlorinated pool every day so my hair is DESPERATE for serious conditioner.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re considering buying these products, I say go for it even though they are expensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tad expensive but to me</li>
            <li> I must say I was skeptical about the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this product.</li>
            <li> Try this brand you wont be sorry you did.</li>
            <li> I know that when buying a Salon shampoo on Amazon, there is a risk that it will be a fake, expired, or diluted</li>
            <li> my hair feels dirty but not with Matrix.</li>
            <li> I am honestly shocked at how well this shampoo and conditioner set has worked for me.</li>
            <li> so if you&#x27;re going to spend just 3 bucks on a shampoo, dont be shocked by the results...</li>
            <li> you can tell your hair suffers when you run out and have to use drugstore brands!</li>
            <li> But I HATED how oily my scalp got because of it.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product because the photo is deceiving.</li>
            <li> The worst part of it all was that my hair felt like sandpaper.</li>
            <li> The hair ends were split and look awful so as soon I use biolage product</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have dry curly hair and this stuff is my go -to shampoo.  Hydrates doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li> I use this combo everyday; although once a week I use an intensive deep conditioner. I feared that since this set is the &#x27;conditioning&#x27;, it would leave my hair flat and greasy. However, it magically doesn&#x27;t deposit a ton of extra oils to weigh down my hair.  Going from brunette to bleach blonde, I bleached my hair a total of three times a few months ago, and I swear I have these products to thank for my soft hair today!  I dye my hair time from time a brunette, and the color holds up great; especially for a shampoo and conditioner system that doesn&#x27;t concentrate on color treated hair in particular.These products smell great too, light fragrance but enough to make your hair smell fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Biolage! I would highly recommend these products.</li>
            <li> This pair is good for thick hair. I color my hair, so my roots get greasy and my ends are dry, but this shampoo and conditioner has helped. Also, it smells wonderful. And this was a great price.</li>
            <li> Hydrating shampoo is really astringent., not hydrating at all.</li>
            <li> Terrific shampoo.  My husband and I both love it.  Really hydrates the hair.</li>
            <li> Have being using this for almost 3 years. Love the smell!</li>
            <li> I like that this shampoo and conditioner clean my hair and leave it shiny and easy to control; curly hair is not that easy to control and this does it.</li>
            <li> I decided to spend a little extra on what I thought would be a fantastic, hydrating hair washing set. I was quite disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to like this set...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair description:  I am Irish-Italian with dark brown, healthy, natural hair (not colored), straight and not thin, not thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Smells fantastic, large bottle and tub with lots of product, good lather and rinses clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Not very hydrating for me. The shampoo might be ok (hard to tell since you use the conditioner right after) but the conditioning balm actually dries my hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I would not recommend this product (even if it smells so gosh darn good), based on my experience. My hair has never felt this dry:(</li>
            <li> I am honestly shocked at how well this shampoo and conditioner set has worked for me. My hair has suffered a year and half worth of heat, chemicals and color treatments. My hair was feeling thick, coarse, frizzy, and was simply unmanageable. The worst part of it all was that my hair felt like sandpaper. Instead of a silky smooth sort of feel, my hair felt rough and very very dry. I&#x27;ve been using both products almost everyday for the past 2 weeks now, and all of the issues stated before are completely gone. Naturally, my hair is very smooth and with a little hair serum it feels like silk. Quite frankly, my hair hasn&#x27;t felt this good in years! Do yourself a favor and get this! I know 30 bucks seems a bit pricey, but the products are large in quantity and given the results, 30 bucks feels like a bargain!</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner are so-so at best. Since using them I have noticed a slight improvement in the moisture of my hair and it does feel softer than usual. I also really like the smell of both. The down side is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to CLEAN my hair very well which, lets face it, is the reason for shampooing in the first place! I&#x27;ve had to combine this with another shampoo which has seemed to help some. If you have a shampoo you already love but maybe need a little more moisture for your hair, than these products might be worth a try.</li>
            <li> I love the conditioning balm, I have long hair that tangles easily and I immediately can tell when a conditioner is good .&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I got some of this product out of the jar, which is a very huge jar ! , what nice surprise for he price, the texture was as described more of a balm. Compared to other products especially those in a jar, which make it easy to get out and put in your hair I felt like I was NOT wasting any product and a teaspoon amount covered my whole hair.&lt;br /&gt;Even with just leaving it in for a couple of minutes it is an amazing silk conditioning balm. It does not weigh your hair down and I can just highly recommend for you to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shampoo, it lathers up nicely with like 2 pumps for my long hair, I got the pump for it as the bottle is huge!&lt;br /&gt;The smell of both products are nicely, simply clean, fresh, but not overpowering like purology.&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure how well the shampoo is hydrating, for me I always think the conditioner is key to beautiful , silky , shiny hair.&lt;br /&gt;But for the price, I normally use John Frieda, great product line, would however give their conditioner a 4 star and biolage 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And doing the math behind the volume of the big bottle vs. buying John Frieda which is I think about 8 oz. it is a wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely stick with the biolage for now , especially the conditioner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS&amp;#62; I did try the silkening milk and it did absolutely nothing for my hair it looks like milk:) and I think the conditioner alone will give your hair enough luster and shine, but everyones hair is different, this is just my review.</li>
            <li> This is a really good bundle deal as you will pay way more if you buy it in a store or salon. The shampoo and conditioner leave my hair feeling soft and healthy. The conditioning balm is my favorite, I have yet to find a conditioner that works as good.</li>
            <li> I had been searching for something to save my hair from the abuse I put it under, and these products pulled through! I straighten my hair almost everyday (yes I am a guy) and these products really are miraculous. I will review each prodcuts individually:    SHAMPOO - Hands down the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. Great even without the balm. It cleans hair wihout drying it out and it really does moisturize the hair. The scent is nice. It contains silk amino acids, which will help to keep hair strong and healthy. The only problem I have had is that after repeated use, it doesn&#x27;t seem to clean the hair as well. I&#x27;m not saying this will happen for everyone though. You will need to use a claryfying shampoo now and then so you won&#x27;t have a problem.     CONDITIONING BALM - I love the fact that it is a balm, so it is conditioing the hair much deeper and you can tell! I usually leave it on for about 5 minutes and rinse with cold water. My hair is instantly repaired and so so much softer and healthier. Leaves you with a nice shine, too. I do use this everyday and my hair does not appear to be damaged, even though I&#x27;m applying heat to it everyday. (Keep in mind I use other products when straightening).     If you&#x27;re considering buying these products, I say go for it even though they are expensive. They will last a long time and be well worth your money in the end.</li>
            <li> I love Biolage products and they are so gentle on the hair.  I have over-processed hair that is dry and broken and after using this shampoo for a while I can really tell the difference!  It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down or make it greasy.  I would recommend this shampoo and conditioner to anyone.  The Conditioning balm is fantastic and hydrates the hair and makes it shiny.</li>
            <li> I do like it. The shampoo tends to dry my hair out, though and I need a hefty amount of conditioner to compensate. It&#x27;s a good shampoo but, unfortunately, not quite as good as I would have hoped. Love the scent and it&#x27;s better than lower end but just not quite compatible with my hair I guess</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of the Biolage products. Esp this conditioning balm. It leaves your hair feeling so soft and smooth. Doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy or weighed down. Has such a clean great smell. A little goes a long way on the Shampoo and conditioner. The price was great when bought this way. Had to order another for my sister.</li>
            <li> It is not as good as BedHead.  I like the Biolage volume shampoo but Hydrating is not worthy the price.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of Matrix Biolage products, especially their ultrahydrating line and I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments on my hair since I started using the shampoo &amp; conditioner every wash. This is a larger version of the small bottles sold in hair salons and an occasional pharmacy (a much better deal too). Took a bit of time to ship, but was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve Been Using Biolage For Years. My Hair Responds Very Well To The Shampoo And conditioner. I Recommend This product</li>
            <li> 20 years and counting ...</li>
            <li> The Hydratherapie line is my favorite now. I saw people complain about the balm but honestly I like the balm better than regular bottled conditioner.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioning mask.&lt;br /&gt;I dye my hair every 4-6 weeks a jet black and I love this stuff. It makes my hair shiny soft and easy to manage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even the days I just let my hair air dry this product pulls through.</li>
            <li> My hair salon only brings these duos out a couple times a year, so I was quite pleased to find the product on Amazon whenever I want it.  Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Excellent shampoo/conditioning balm for hydration of the hair. If you have to deal with brittle hair, frequently coloring, this is a good product.</li>
            <li> I got this combo at a great price . I was worried about it coming in one piece. The packaging and delivery was in great condition and time.</li>
            <li> This is a great duo of salon-quality products at about half the cost of retail.</li>
            <li> I have think frizzy hair.  This stuff works great on it.  My hair is smooth and shiny.  Better than it&#x27;s been in years!!</li>
            <li> My hair feels thicker since I started using these products; also seem to leave it softer and shinier.  This is a good value for these products.</li>
            <li> These products are really good! I have coarse, thick, curly hair and live in the south. So humid summers and rainy weather makes my hair triple in size. This product does a good job taming it. The hydrating formula seems to work well for the coarse texture and helps create a smoother look. I still have to put other product in my hair to control the curl and frizz, but this does a good job for the first part of the process.</li>
            <li> I love this Biolage Hydratherapie hydrating duo. I&#x27;ve used it for 15 years + and it&#x27;s always my favorite after I try other brands. My hair is thick but tends to be dry at the ends and prone to split ends. This takes care of that well. (This may be heavy for someone with very thin hair that needs volume).</li>
            <li> It is just okay, I am not completely in love with it and I am very picky so that is saying something.</li>
            <li> It seems to be the only thing that keeps my hair hydrated.  I have long, fine hair and have to wash it daily or it becomes a grease pit and this duo keeps my happy and healthy.  I may stray and try other products, but I always come back to Biolage.</li>
            <li> I have well water.  There are lots of minerals in it.  For some reason this makes my hair super tangled, like impossible to comb through.  I have tried SO many different kinds of conditioners that will de-tangle my hair and make it soft and I keep coming back to Biolage.  It&#x27;s a tad expensive but to me it&#x27;s worth every penny.  Leaves my hair soft and shiny and tangle free.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Fantastic products...</li>
            <li> This shampoo and balm conditioner are great for my color treated hair.  My hair feels so silky smooth after using the balm.  Sometimes I wash and leave the balm in for several hours or even overnight before rinsing out.  Highly recommend if you have color treated hair.</li>
            <li> Moisturizing with out being heavy or greasy feeling. The extra moisture has allowed me to grow my hair out this past year and have it look very healthy and shiny. I&#x27;d give it 5 stars except for the lack of a pump of any kind for the conditioner and that you have to purchase it separately for the shampoo. It also smells clean and fresh without being perfumey.</li>
            <li> Biolage smells great and is moisturizing for my curly hair. I use a lot of product and blow dry often, but this shampoo keeps away buildup and keeps it from drying out. It&#x27;s a great price on Amazon, plus the convenience of having it delivered means I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> The shampoo alone is a great product, but add the conditioning balm and you are set. This makes my hair feel great, no greasy feeling, just moisturized and soft. It helps my split ends better than in store brands too, keeps them from going in all crazy directions. After a fresh hair cut this duo is great on my hair keeping it from being frizzy...yes, even in the winter my hair gets frizzy...and dry from the air...these products are simply great! With regular use and using my other in hair curl defining cream, it makes my hair feel awesome for the entire work day and into the evening...</li>
            <li> It came quicker than I expected... like in 2 days. The product works amazing! I have thick, fairly dry hair from blow drying and straightening. Makes my hair feel so soft! Doesn&#x27;t build up at all. I am sticking with this til they stop making it lol.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this same combination on sale at my hairdressers&#x27; some time ago.  I&#x27;ve used them faithfully and loved the way they leave my hair.  I was almost out of conditioner and discovered they were no longer available at my salon, so checked on Amazon.  I was pleased to find the same size (large) combo and at a lower cost than I had paid previously.  I am a happy girl!</li>
            <li> I love Matrix products and have been using it about 16 years now. This is the first time using the hydrating line as I use the strengthening and I have to say that the hydrating is exactly what I needed. The shampoo lathers really good and moisturizes and nourishes your hair and the conditioning balm detangles and makes your hair so soft. I recommend anyone to try this line if you have dry and easily tangled hair. It is great and I will be using this line from now on.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Biolage products but I dont always have the money to buy them. These products are usually $18-22 a piece at the store I usually go to, so I was stoked to see them in a $25 bundle! They shipped in just a few days, too.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. And the online prices are fantastic. I&#x27;ll be back to purchase again!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!!! I have been using Nexxus for a long time but just finally wanted to try something new. This smells really good and leaves my hair feeling great. I got this package for $25 which is a really good price for this brand and the size is large. I am really picky about my conditioners, I like them to be very rich and creamy and this is! It says to use it every 2 or 3 days I think, but I use it every day, I just try not to use too much at a time</li>
            <li> I love this hair product. Have used it for a long time and my hair is healthy.  Great price too.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this product at all.  It weighs down my hair and makes styling impossible.  Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and have used it for years.  It leaves my hair soft and manageable.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair dry. Conditioner tangles hair very well :|</li>
            <li> It does a good job on my dry hair , it does clean and I like the way my hair smells</li>
            <li> just what I wanted! I was a little worried that they would be opened or watered down since so inexpensive! but completely new and wrapped as a pack! I love love love the conditioning balm and love love love the smell! best price!!!! beats any beauty shop or target!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner and the prices I find on Amazon for the set are great!  Very little shampoo is needed for a good lather and the conditioner has really maintained the strength &amp; softness of my hair.  I have thyroid disease and my hair tends to be very dry so using Matrix helps me maintain my hair in good condition.</li>
            <li> I use this product on curly color treated hair that I routinely straighten. It&#x27;s not the best or the worst. I find it does a good job of keeping my hair from looking fried and leaves it fairly manageable. I prefer it over what you can buy at a drug store but if I wasn&#x27;t so cheap I would probably go for a product like aveda. It is probably only a step up from Pantene.</li>
            <li> I wish it smelled better, not that it smells bad, just that I love strong smelling hair products. works very well, though, makes my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> This is really great stuff. I&#x27;ve tried other shampoos over the years (trying to save money) and have never liked anything as much. Makes my hair so pretty!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing I have noticed so much difference in my hair, I truly recommended to use this product</li>
            <li> As much as I like to patronize my local hair salon, these prices on Amazon cannot be beat.  The two products work together very well.  I&#x27;d never tried a cream conditioner until I got this set and I&#x27;m so glad to find it.</li>
            <li> I can really feel and see the difference with Biolage vs other shampoos. My hair comes out clean, soft and full. the price for this is worth it for the big shampoo bottle alone, but the balm should last a very long time, as it is only needed 2x a week and very little goes a long way. The shampoo smells nice without being perfumey or overpowering. The balm has no scent and will weigh down hair if you use too much. I recommend pairing the shampoo with the Biolage conditioner of your choice (I&#x27;m using the bamboo one now.) Top notch product.</li>
            <li> My hair is super soft since I started using this shampoo and conditioner.  I am done with my search.  I will definitely keep using this on my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years and it works great for me.  I recommend this product for those of you have dry hair.</li>
            <li> Im not too sure this product is authentic Biolage...the conditioner doesn&#x27;t smell the same as the one that I buy from hair salons locally.  My hair didn&#x27;t react the same way as when I have bought Biolage from a salon either...so, I&#x27;m on the fence about it.  Quick shipping though.</li>
            <li> It was very satisfactory as well as very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I am extremley upset by what recieved from you!  I bought Matrix Biolage Hudratherapie Hydrating Shampoo and Conditioning Balm.  The Shampoo was 1/4 empty and the jar of balm was also about 1/3 used.  I think it is disgusting to package this to &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; like a new product and then cheat your customers!</li>
            <li> THIS is an incredible product- it IS REAL, and the price- COME ON!!!!! It doesnt get better than this. I feel like every time i wash my hair, i am in a salon :) My brother is kind of a... &amp;#34;hippie&amp;#34;? haha But anyways he barely washes his hair, its incredible beautiful and curly- ANYWAYS this is the only shampoo/conditioner he uses! it smells wonderful, no harmful ingredients, and the conditioner-whoa, talk about silky smooth hair!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> THE CONDITIONER IS AWESOME THANKS</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel great</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love - this is a great product!</li>
            <li> Have been using for years and this is a great price for this product. Checked locally and it is almost double. Arrived without any issues. Well packaged.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a new shampoo and decided to check Amazon for top reviewed ones. I have tried so many (cheap and expensive) and have never found one I really liked.&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;1. You get a lot, so it lasts a while.&lt;br /&gt;2. It moisturizes hair down to the ends.My hair is kind of an oily/dry combo and while I don&#x27;t color it, or use an excessive amount of product or heat, the ends can get very dry and damaged. This shampoo/conditioner leaves my hair soft and silky down to the ends, without drying it out and making it oily.&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;None</li>
            <li> Awesome!!!  If you live in a town where you have to travel to get this...here is your solution!</li>
            <li> I used it for about two weeks before writing this.  I normally use expensive products such as Bumble &amp; Bumble or Paul Mitchell.  I was looking for a less expensive alternative.  The shampoo works well along with the conditioner and you get a lot of product for the money.  It worked well for the first week but unfortunately it dried my hair out after two weeks.  Maybe I can alternate this product with another one so it doesn&#x27;t go to waste.</li>
            <li> I found my hair color lasted longer with the product. I like that it is not crazy on suds...it is just enough.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a lot more from Matrix.  I have thick fine hair and have used their sleek products for the past two years, loved them but wanted to try something new.  I have not found these products to provide any type of intense hydrating to my hair or scalp.  I still have knots and flyaways.  The balm is not a great rinse out conditioner but it does a fair job of smoothing flyaways during styling.  I was very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo! It&#x27;s done wonders for my thin, damaged hair. I will never buy or use another product again!</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a shampoo/conditioner that would fix my unhealthy hair. This works great. I love the conditioning balm. My hair is now soft, shiny &amp; healthy. I wash/dry &amp; straighten it everyday and it always looks great! I would definitely recommend to anyone wanting to try it out, it is worth the money!</li>
            <li> I have been using these for years and I really love it. Softens hair. Very good product. What else can I say...</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo ever! And a lot cheaper from this site than at a cosmo prov!</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and dry. This stuff really works to moisturize and keep my natural waves in. My friends actually noticed the difference so I know its really working. Definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> Love these products. They promote healthy hair for people like me that use a flat iron and curling iron.</li>
            <li> My hair tend to be dry and brittle from color processing, the blow dryer, curling iron, etc.  Matrix Biolage is the only formula I have found that hydrates my hair without making it heavy and limp.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> great transaction-wonderful product.</li>
            <li> THANKS  These are both products I use all the time and the price was great---------thanks for having them available!! I am enjoying both.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time. The shampoo is gentle and the conditioning balm moisturizes and eliminates fly-away &amp; tangles.</li>
            <li> Nice product, wish it was less pricey.</li>
            <li> I have thin limp long hair.  Over the last 20 years sometimes I try to stray to another brand or a &amp;#34;thickening shampoo&amp;#34;, but I always come back.  It just works the best.  Eliminates static and just makes my hair lay better and lighter.</li>
            <li> well worth the money for this shampoo and conditioner.  it is a great product and i will definitely be ordering it again when i need it!</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely fashion and was as described.</li>
            <li> I always use this shampoo and buy it from amazon not just for convenience but also for the decent price. The conditioning balm that comes with it is great for added hydration but I wouldn&#x27;t use it on a daily basis because it would leave my hair too oily.</li>
            <li> Came earlier than expected and as described.</li>
            <li> some people in this household love it, some other people like me dont. Must be different hair? My hair is usually wavy, my hair get frizzy on humid or rainy days. This do not hydrate my hair. it makes my hair more dry and feels not soft at all, it was horrible dry feeling. I tried leaving the conditioner in longer second time, it did not make any difference. Stopped using it and went back to my usual sham/cond. Now my hair is soft again. I will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> This is a regular purchase of mine. It does a great job at cleaning my air and scalp. It is also super moisturizing and hydrates my long locks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a distance swimmer and spend about 2.5 hours in a chlorinated pool every day so my hair is DESPERATE for serious conditioner. In all my years swimming, the Biolage Conditioning Balm is the ONLY conditioner that works- it gets my hair back to feeling &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; (even after being thoroughly rinsed after applying) but doesn&#x27;t make it look limp, heavy, or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is great, too- it doesn&#x27;t strip hair as it cleanses, so you can really scrub up without worrying that your hair will feel like straw afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great combination of products.</li>
            <li> The best shampoo and conditionin Balm ever. I love it. The smell is great. The hair looks spectacular. So recomended.</li>
            <li> Great value!  Best product for thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this hair product, and will always use it.  My daughters love it too!  They need to make them in bigger sizes, lol.</li>
            <li> Simply the best shampoo and conditioner you can buy.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo ever! I love the scent and my hair feels silky and healthy!</li>
            <li> I love these products! My hair stylist recommended this for me when I flat iron my hair and the deep conditioner in general. Since I&#x27;m naturally curly I must say I was skeptical about the shampoo. But it works great! It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out at all and detangles really well. As for the deep conditioner, this is probably one of the best deep conditioners I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s nice and thick and a little goes a long way. When you rinse it out your hair feel nice and soft and shiny and tangle free.</li>
            <li> I love the products! Amazon provides great pricing on the combination purchase in comparison to hair salons and hair stores. the product nourishes the hair and the scalp. I feel like my hair is regaining its bounce and glow back especially after using bleach products for the last 8 years. It has a nice smell. Conditioner feels very rich and smooth in texture, however, it does not leave hair greasy.</li>
            <li> love this product and it came to me fast. GREAT PRICE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;makes my blonde hair shiny without making it look greasy. moisturized my dry hair. no frizz! healthy!</li>
            <li> Delivery on time....Biolage products are the best!! I wear hair extensions and I was using a normal conditioner and gets dry. The hair ends were split and look awful so as soon I use biolage product Oh wow since 1st day I notice a very good change!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this product. My hair looks like I came out of a salon every time I use this shampoo and conditioner. I keep telling all of my friends about it! To blow dry and straighten my hair, it used to take 2 hours. Now it takes 40 minutes. GET THIS PRODUCT. It&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li> I started out with Surface shampoos, when I went to see my stylist I talked to her about it and she ordered me a bottle of the Surface. She uses the biolage and she used it on me when I got my hair done. She gave me some samples and so I continued to use them at home. I really loved this product as much as the Surface product. It did all the same things for my hair that Surface did and is a little more budget friendly, it is also easier to buy locally I found out after I ordered it online, Even Wal Mart&#x27;s salon carries this brand!! My hair is soft shiny hydrated and doesn&#x27;t tangle. I can run my fingers through it easily. I also get greasy roots but not with this product, I no longer wake up with my head looking like an oil spill. I purchased the Matrix brand (a little cheaper than their Biolage line and exactly the same I think) for volumizing and I love it! It really helps define my curls and gives me a lift, where as this set helps it go straight. between the three sets I now have, this one the Surface and the Matrix wavy I&#x27;m set for at least a year. I plan to mix it up between the three depending on my hair needs. The conditioner with this set is a once or twice a week use because it&#x27;s a deep conditioner, you would need to purchase the everyday conditioner for everyday use but this is a great deal because the conditioner alone costs almost as much as the set. I&#x27;m so happy I found these products, my hair is loving me for it. No more half used bottles or stuff that doesn&#x27;t so anything for me, no more searching the shampoo aisle for the next brand that will make my hair look like a models, I found them and it&#x27;s worth the price, you only need a little bit of product it goes a long way. after I shampoo I squeeze the water out of my hair and apply a quarter size ( i have super long hair) amount of conditioner to my hair then I use a pick to comb it in and distribute it evenly though my hair. Try this brand you wont be sorry you did.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for years and was really happy to get the conditioning balm with it for the price you would pay at the store for just the shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! My hair loves this shampoo and conditioner. When you can get 2 for $30, it&#x27;s worth the buy!</li>
            <li> JUST AS EXPECTED!!!! THANK YOU</li>
            <li> Great price for shampoo and conditioner.  Arrived quickly and in tact.</li>
            <li> Biolage is the only product that works for me. I&#x27;ve put my hair through a lot over the years (I&#x27;m blonde but had a period of black hair and went back blonde after that..yikes).I also have no thyroid so that makes my hair super dry and brittle.  Biolage makes my hair manageable and soft again. I really can&#x27;t recommend it enough to people who have dry, brittle, overprocessed hair! I&#x27;ve used it for years, now.</li>
            <li> I try other shampoos but keep coming back to the Biolage hydrating shampoo. Conditioner works well without a lot of buildup.</li>
            <li> Love this product. So good for your hair and feel so good to. I bought some for my sister to help condition her hair in severe weather conditions. love it</li>
            <li> I think the formula was changed and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling the way it used to.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is very effective on any kind of hair, especially on damaged and/or color damaged hair.  Helped&lt;br /&gt;my hair look and feel better.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo and conditioner I can use that doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.  I always have problems with my hair drying out because I highlight it and use a flat iron every day.  This keeps my hair nice and soft!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been in search of the right shampoo and conditioner for my dry hair. After trying to avoid paying a &#x27;high price&#x27; and picking tresame or organix...I sucked it up, listend to my stylist and bought this. I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference...all positive. You really dont need much to wash your hair which is awesome because it&#x27;ll last longer which is good for the money in your pockets. You get what you pay for...so if you&#x27;re going to spend just 3 bucks on a shampoo, dont be shocked by the results...I&#x27;m finally learning this :)</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite lines of Shampoo and Conditioner.  My hair feels so soft and manageable after only one use!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! It leaves my hair feeling really clean and the smell is nice too. I have thin hair, but a lot of it. Ususlly by the second day my hair feels dirty but not with Matrix. When I&#x27;m using Matrix I dont have to wash my hair until the 3rd day. That is why I love this product so much. I hope this helps you to decide if this product will be great for you like it was for me.</li>
            <li> Just what I always use, got here quickly and the perfect shampoo and conditioner for me</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this shampoo to me because of it&#x27;s ideal pH balance and affordability.  I ordered some from Amazon and my dry, coarse, curly hair has been soft and bouncy.  I get more compliments on my hair now and will never use another product!</li>
            <li> Love love love this shampoo!! My hair has never felt and looked better before. I have only used this shampoo about two months and haven&#x27;t used anything else since I tried this one. It was recommended by my hair dresser and I am so happy she did. I will definitely continue using this shampoo and conditioner !!!</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo and conditioner it works great. I sometimes sleep with conditioner in over night. Hair is so soft the next day.</li>
            <li> I know that when buying a Salon shampoo on Amazon, there is a risk that it will be a fake, expired, or diluted but I have been lucky so far with my previous Biolage purchases. I have no proof that this is a &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; product but it made my hair feel dry and like straw, unlike any Biolage products I have used previously. I am so upset that I spent this money. Biolage is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; shampoo, but I will not be using the products from this sellter. I bought the real products from a store so I know what I am getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy at your own risk...</li>
            <li> This set came package in a holiday themed gift set from 2011.  I love the smell of Biolage products, but have been disappointed in this set.  I never could understand why products that boast about hydration and the end of dry hair would have alcohol within the first five ingredients listed. The shampoo is great, but the conditioner does not work at all.  My hair is dryer than ever and is frizzy beyond belief if I let it dry naturally.  I HAVE to use a straight iron because of the frizz which dries my hair out even more.  Shampoo, thumbs up...conditioner is a real loser.  I wonder if old product is to blame here...</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product because the photo is deceiving. The photo shows a hydrotherapy product which is what I was looking for. If I wanted what I was actually sent which was hydra source then I could have gotten a better deal saving $10. I feel like I was tricked into getting this product and paid out more than I should&#x27;ve.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and Balm for the hair. It leaves my hair shiny and fuller. I would recommend this product to all.&lt;br /&gt;I have fine limp hair and this gives me the body my hair needs along with the shine.</li>
            <li> Amazing Product with an Amazing price point.</li>
            <li> Leave the conditioner on longer to restore damaged dry hair. I received compliments from my hairstylist on the health of my hair.</li>
            <li> My very long, fine, thin hair was pretty damaged from laying in a hospital bed for a while after surgery and a period of recovery. These worked great to restore moisture, shine, and softness to my dry, dull, and brittle hair. It is also a great value since it is such a large size, it will last quite a while. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and like how it both cleans and hydrates my hair.  I have nothing more to say.</li>
            <li> It definitely left my ends very soft &amp; healthier. But I HATED how oily my scalp got because of it. My hair looks weighed down.  From the reviews it seemed like the shampoo wasn&#x27;t suppose to weigh your hair down but it did the complete opposite. Does anyone have any advice on what else to use so that this doesn&#x27;t happen ? Thanks</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price.  This is about half of what I pay in my salon for these exact products.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Very top of the line product buy it you&#x60;ll see.</li>
            <li> Same day delivery was awesome, it&#x27;s a great product too!</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start out by saying - my hair is very, very frizzy and very difficult to tame.&lt;br /&gt;I got a sample of this shampoo and conditioning balm while walking through Wal-Mart, a girl popped out in front of me and asked me if I wanted it and I took it for pure amusement. A couple days later, I decided to try it out - again, for pure amusement. Holy cow! I was amazed with just one use!&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo rinsed out COMPLETELY - I&#x27;ve never had a shampoo rinse out to where my hair squeaked when rubbing it. I was impressed already. The conditioning balm is unlike any conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used - it&#x27;s thick and definitely coated my hair how I needed it to. And of course, it all smells good but not too strong of a smell.&lt;br /&gt;Then, I blow-dried my hair using my diffuser to make it curly like I usually do. When I usually do my hair, I dry it then have to put extra product in it to tame the frizz, then dry it again.&lt;br /&gt;With this shampoo and conditioning balm, I didn&#x27;t have to put any extra product in my hair after it was dry. It was very smooth with hardly any frizz. My hair was moisturized very well. I&#x27;ve never had these kinds of results from only one use. I am definitely going to get this product and I&#x27;ve never considered spending so much on shampoo and conditioner before.</li>
            <li> I have been using these products for more than 20 years and they have never failed me. Healthy beautiful hair will result.</li>
            <li> I used to use dove, pantene, aveeno, etc. I couldn&#x27;t bare to pay so highly for hair care. Dove used to be my favorite, and before highlighting/dying my hair it did a superb job, but afterward chemical processes I had dry hair with very tangled and dry split ends! So I decided to break down and try a good *salon* product,:( No drugstore shampoo/conditioner did much but make my hair feel greasy and weighed down :( and After reading hair specialist reviews and suggestions on a good hair system for dry/damaged hair, I bought the small sized bottles of this at my local grocery store. I will not lie and say that during the actual shampoo/conditioning process in the shower I wasn&#x27;t extremely impressed and I thought my hair would still be dry and icky after towel drying it. NOT AT ALL, when my hair was dry, it was feather light weight and so soft to touch. The true test was sleeping. Usually when I wake up my hair has dried out immensely while I&#x27;ve slept, but not with this biolage system! My hair is amazing and it&#x27;s only been one day. Spend the extra dough and get this great system. I&#x27;m gonna return my small bottles and just buy this combo set since I payed the same amount for the smaller set at my grocery store! Thanks biolage, beautiful hair is possible!!! I&#x27;m throwing out ALL of my cheap hair products! (p.s I also sprayed a tad of Miracle 7 veal in mist, from Sally&#x27;s on my ends as I usually do and that makes it even better)</li>
            <li> I used to use this when I was in college â€“ forgot about it until recently and I&#x27;m using it again. It is absolutely fantastic â€“ keeps my hair healthy and shiny and smells really good!</li>
            <li> there is a reason Biolage is an expensive shampoo ...would definitely recommend and within a month you&#x27;ll definitely see a difference in your hair.. would recommend for all hair types</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner combo! Works well on my fine, straight, sometimes oily hair. Great scent.</li>
            <li> My personal favorite. This is the same quality, same product I get from the salon at a far better price. I recommend getting the 33.8oz shampoo pump, but do NOT get the pump for the conditioner, it does not pick up the thick conditioner. I recommend using four fingers to scoop the conditioner and apply. It&#x27;s wonderful product and smells great for Male or Female.</li>
            <li> I never wanted to resort to overly expensive shampoos, but this product is so great, especially if you have hard water. It worked immediately and makes your hair sooo soft and manageable. You don&#x27;t need much to get a good lather, not like other shampoos. I have long hair (down to mid back) and I don&#x27;t need much at all! So, this product out lasts store bought shampoo by about 2 folds, maybe more. A worthy investment for beautiful hair.</li>
            <li> Great product have used before and will reorder again in the future.</li>
            <li> The shampoo works like any other, but the conditioning balm is so absolutely fantastic! I leave it in as long as I possibly can. Often putting it in towards the end of my shower, then go do laundry or whatever then hop back in to rinse it off. The longer you leave it in, the better it is for your hair. My hair has been a mess since I highlighted my hair...super dry and straw-like but not since I&#x27;ve started using this conditioning balm. Now its smooth and Shiny! Will be buying again!!</li>
            <li> Price is Cheaper and good quality, good packing and fast for shipping.</li>
            <li> I have used it for years. Yes, I know you are suppose to switch up shampoos etc...Last time I got my haircut I spent almost $100 on a new Paul Mitchell shampoo and conditioner and have recently found myself breaking opening up my Biologe DUO. The best shampoo for me. I know everyone is different, but I love the hydration!!!</li>
            <li> well. actually i viewed other people&#x27;s commends. they said this product is really good, the shompoo just really hydrated and it also can be use without condtioner. so i tried. i bought both of them. but im a little bit disappointed because it just like other shampoo, i feel dry when i wash off. them i put conditioner on my hair. i dont know what is the difference from other cheaper shampoo and conditioner. maybe i need to use more times to find out the effctive.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo forsure! been using for years...you can tell your hair suffers when you run out and have to use drugstore brands!</li>
            <li> I have been using Biolage for years now. I have fine, dry hair and need shampoo and conditioner that don&#x27;t make my hair feel stringy after using it. The Hydrotherapie brand by Biolage is exactly what I needed! The shampoo has a very nice scent that stays with you even after the shower and the condtioning balm is heaven for my hair! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is the only product I use for my hair.  It usually is very expensive, but the price was right....</li>
