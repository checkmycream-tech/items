            <li>my recipe- enjoy!</li>
            <li>They should not be able to advertise this as organic when it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>Body  is feeling  better.</li>
            <li>It helps with lots of different health issues is a great price!  </li>
            <li>I have a really easy palate, I like most foods and all veggies.  </li>
            <li>Because of the added preservatives it doesn&#x27;t taste good and isn&#x27;t pure.</li>
            <li>Good Job , keep it up Thanks for sending the product.</li>
            <li>Just that the flavor is a bit strong and acid.  </li>
            <li>If I was using it in a protein shake, it would probably have been fine.</li>
            <li>I am adding this product in my daily lifestyle because its great for the skin, helps boost immune system, and alkalines the body.</li>
            <li>and my skin is silky and blemish free.</li>
            <li>This product has a bit of Potassium Sorbate in it already, so if you are making your own skincare, consider this, putting more in may not be necessary.</li>
            <li>Great  product, no  real  taste,  </li>
            <li>I do believe you can find it much cheaper at grocery stores, however after reading the label at the grocery store, it had more than just Aloe Juice, for skincare, I like to keep it clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The glucose drink tastes like uber sweet orange Kool-Aid.</li>
            <li>I have it in a mister and use it on top of lotion and it helps it to absorb in to the skin and protects the skin from drying out so fast.</li>
            <li>I use this(about 3/4 cap full), along with 1 Tablespoon Psyllium Husks Powder and about 1/4 cup apple juice.</li>
            <li>I was blown away at the effect and am so happy to share with other folks that are suffering w/ this condition</li>
            <li>This juice is a mild version of that.</li>
            <li>and overall I am very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>The flavored one is too sweet for my taste and has a lower percentage of actual aloe vera, thus it is not as effective as this one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth ordering.</li>
            <li>the juice of 1/2 fresh lemon&lt;br</li>
            <li>make an ice slushee with the juice and it tastes so refreshing, so good a treat that I&#x27;ve turned other folks onto taking this juice for ALL of its medical benefits:&lt;br</li>
            <li>The juice was shipped out very fast</li>
            <li>I take it first thing in the morning</li>
            <li>and when I ordered it online, that is exactly what I got.</li>
            <li>I have known top Medical Doctors that used the Aloe Vera leaf of the plant on burns to prevent scares.</li>
            <li>this is the first review i&#x27;ve ever done on amazon.com because I have to share how positive this juice is for treating my acid reflux/GERD/tummy troubles.</li>
            <li>I consider this good internally and externally.</li>
            <li>some positive &#x27;</li>
            <li>I thought it was pure all by itself.  </li>
            <li>It is pure aloe vera juice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably a good product but so hard to drink for me</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d trashed the needed paperwork before I really noticed and could return it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>so I am use to really earthy flavors, etc.  </li>
            <li>I have a whole bottle of it that I can&#x27;t touch</li>
            <li>Delivery time was fast, a day or two before the estimated arrival date.</li>
            <li>Very upset.</li>
            <li>I love it for a cooling sun spray with lavender essential oil mixed in.</li>
            <li>Add a little agave nectar to it and it seems much more palatable.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t drink this, I use it as a leave in conditioner for my hair and it makes it super soft instantly</li>
            <li>and she loves the way it makes her new growth feel.</li>
            <li>I have natural 4C hair</li>
            <li>My 17 year old daughter decided to go natural and she has 4A hair</li>
            <li>Someone compared the taste to the drink pregnant women take for the glucose screening... not true.</li>
            <li>She is a long grow-out transitioner and it prevents breakage between the permed hair and the new growth by softening the new growth making it easier to comb out.</li>
            <li>Waste of good hard earned money.</li>
            <li>I tried Nature&#x27;s Way, because it said that it was not bitter tasting.</li>
            <li>It has other healing benefits, so even though the GIRD is gone (and so is the job that was causing so much stress), he still takes it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very bitter, but I got used to it and grew to really like it.</li>
            <li>I only recently had to taste it because I developed a sudden severe stomach ache/nausea attack</li>
    </ol>

            <li> and I use this with a little water in a spray bottle to keep my hair soft and moist as I comb through for my twist outs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering w/ this condition for so long, jumping through the hoops of pharmaceutical and holistic treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I chug this stuff all day/night long.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t occur to me that the aloe vera was pure...and mixed with other things.  </li>
            <li> and it would last a long time, but you&#x27;re supposed to drink around a cup a day which means it lasts less than a week.</li>
            <li> and I tried mixing it in with a V8, just one little tablespoon of this stuff in a 12oz can of V8 totally overwhelmed it</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> The product came just as I expected it to.</li>
            <li> It has an uber tart/bitter taste that I could not block out, even with my nose closed.</li>
            <li> crushed ice&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> THE ABSOLUTE MOST HORRIBLE DRINK IN THE WORLD.</li>
            <li> No More it&#x27;s advised to drink 3-4 ounces of this daily before meals and at bedtime to help sooth and coat your stomach thus alleviating your GERD/acid reflux symptoms.</li>
            <li> I  am still  waiting a little linger to see its health benefits as others have mentioned.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday.</li>
            <li> This was fine as a product but the container was awful, the aloe juice dribbled down the container every time you opened or closed the container.</li>
            <li> Adding about 1.5 oz of orange juice made it palatable for me, but I took away two stars because having to mix it with a vitamin C drink makes it dangerous, due to a preservative already present in this juice.</li>
            <li> For some reason I also thought I&#x27;d drink a small amount a day</li>
            <li> I usually use George&#x27;s Aloe Vera, which tastes and looks like water.</li>
            <li> I have to say mixing it with a small glass of water during one meal a day has helped a lot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been referred to George&#x27;s, which is tasteless :) and Lily of the Valley, which is nastier :(</li>
            <li> Arrived cold and wrapped tightly.  </li>
            <li> Not great tasting.  </li>
            <li> A thin layer on the face heals, balances (like a toner), calms, moisturizes, and creates a glow.</li>
            <li> This aloe Vera whole leaf juice tastes nasty.  </li>
            <li> Silly me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this is not just aloe juice.  </li>
            <li> Silly me!  </li>
            <li> Doubtful health benefits</li>
            <li> and it tastes horrible too.</li>
            <li> But this stuff is disgusting.  </li>
            <li> Tastes HORRIBLE!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Big fan of nature&#x27;s way product.. Didn&#x27;t like the from concentrate sign</li>
            <li> This was fine as a product but the container was awful, the aloe juice dribbled down the container every time you opened or closed the container.</li>
            <li> I tried many brands after they stopped selling it at vitamin world ect. and none were as helpful as this brand. I take it first thing in the morning so I can drink my starbucks coffee without my stomach feeling acidic/irritated and nauseous. This is the best solution i have found for stomach acidity. It&#x27;s worth ordering. It&#x27;s very bitter, but I got used to it and grew to really like it. The flavored one is too sweet for my taste and has a lower percentage of actual aloe vera, thus it is not as effective as this one.</li>
            <li> Silly me!  It didn&#x27;t occur to me that the aloe vera was pure...and mixed with other things.  I thought it was pure all by itself.  I&#x27;d trashed the needed paperwork before I really noticed and could return it.  Silly me.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected. Thanks.</li>
            <li> This product has a bit of Potassium Sorbate in it already, so if you are making your own skincare, consider this, putting more in may not be necessary. The product shipped on time. I do believe you can find it much cheaper at grocery stores, however after reading the label at the grocery store, it had more than just Aloe Juice, for skincare, I like to keep it clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> The product came just as I expected it to. I&#x27;ve bought this Aloe Vera juice in the store before and when I ordered it online, that is exactly what I got. It is pure aloe vera juice. It has so many uses. It is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Love this healthy herb.</li>
            <li> It is a good product.  Just that the flavor is a bit strong and acid.  It&#x27;s best if you dilute it with water or juice.</li>
            <li> Good product I will add to water or smoothie</li>
            <li> Would not buy again. Doubtful health benefits and it tastes horrible too. Waste of good hard earned money. Don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> My husband originally starting taking aleo vera juice for severe GIRD. (It was misdiagnosed as a heart attack)&lt;br /&gt;In only a day or two, his symptoms dissappeared and have not come back. That was 5 years ago. He takes an ounce or two before each meal. It has other healing benefits, so even though the GIRD is gone (and so is the job that was causing so much stress), he still takes it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He recommended it to a friend who had suffered with stomach belching at night to the point he could not and had not slept well in years. The friend got some and slept that night all the way through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Will reorder when needed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this is not just aloe juice.  Aloe should not have a taste to it.  Because of the added preservatives it doesn&#x27;t taste good and isn&#x27;t pure. won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> Good for your digestive needs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably a good product but so hard to drink for me (I dislike the way it&#x27;s carbonated). For some reason I also thought I&#x27;d drink a small amount a day and it would last a long time, but you&#x27;re supposed to drink around a cup a day which means it lasts less than a week.</li>
            <li> Gave me diarrhea as drank a daily cap. Taking only three spoon hopefully it works as it is known to avoid future cancer.</li>
            <li> had a kidney transplant.  good refreshing product, thirst quencher</li>
            <li> Yuck, yuck, yuck.  I have a really easy palate, I like most foods and all veggies.  I am a vegetarian so I am use to really earthy flavors, etc.  But this stuff is disgusting.  I have a whole bottle of it that I can&#x27;t touch, it&#x27;s just too gross to drink and I tried mixing it in with a V8, just one little tablespoon of this stuff in a 12oz can of V8 totally overwhelmed it, it&#x27;s all I could taste.  yuck, yuck, double yuck.</li>
            <li> Not great tasting.  But none of them are.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for what I use it for. I didn&#x27;t realize that you have to refrigerate after opening however.. bummer ;(. Delivery time was fast, a day or two before the estimated arrival date. I am adding this product in my daily lifestyle because its great for the skin, helps boost immune system, and alkalines the body.</li>
            <li> I will warn you it doesn&#x27;t have a great taste but it can be added to fruit juices to improve the taste. I a noticing that I feel a lot better health wise and my skin is silky and blemish free. The juice was shipped out very fast and overall I am very satisfied with the product. The bottle is petty big and will last me a while. I love the juice and the health benefits are great.</li>
            <li> I usually use George&#x27;s Aloe Vera, which tastes and looks like water. I tried Nature&#x27;s Way, because it said that it was not bitter tasting. But it was just not palatable for me. If I was using it in a protein shake, it would probably have been fine.</li>
            <li> This Aloe Vera Juice is very very good for stomach problems.  It is also great for burns.  I have known top Medical Doctors that used the Aloe Vera leaf of the plant on burns to prevent scares.</li>
            <li> I bought this to mix into recipes for my hair &amp; skin. I&#x27;m a Brown-American with 4a/4b kinky-curly hair and combination, acne-prone skin. Your hair needs this! It is great in a leave-in, as it balances ph; thus softening &amp; banishing frizz, as well as nourishing with nutrients. A thin layer on the face heals, balances (like a toner), calms, moisturizes, and creates a glow. When used regularly, it banishes my moderate acne. I only recently had to taste it because I developed a sudden severe stomach ache/nausea attack/urge to vomit after taking Naproxen. I did not know if it was either a type of acid reaction or an ulcer, but I had no Pepto or Tums or anything. I drank two fluid ounces of this juice... worked like a charm! I will continue to take it 1-2x daily, incase I do have an ulcer... it will heal the stomach lining. Someone compared the taste to the drink pregnant women take for the glucose screening... not true. I think she got her drinks mixed up. The glucose drink tastes like uber sweet orange Kool-Aid. This tastes like the stuff they give you before surgery or delivery, that takes away your appetite and whatnot. YES. THAT STUFF. THE ABSOLUTE MOST HORRIBLE DRINK IN THE WORLD. This juice is a mild version of that. It has an uber tart/bitter taste that I could not block out, even with my nose closed. Adding about 1.5 oz of orange juice made it palatable for me, but I took away two stars because having to mix it with a vitamin C drink makes it dangerous, due to a preservative already present in this juice. For that reason alone, I will not purchase this brand again. I&#x27;ve been referred to George&#x27;s, which is tasteless :) and Lily of the Valley, which is nastier :( but preservative-free.</li>
            <li> Good Job , keep it up Thanks for sending the product. Glad to do business with you.&lt;br /&gt;Will do it again</li>
            <li> Love this - health benefits are awesome</li>
            <li> this is the first review i&#x27;ve ever done on amazon.com because I have to share how positive this juice is for treating my acid reflux/GERD/tummy troubles. It was instantaneous, the relief. I&#x27;ve been suffering w/ this condition for so long, jumping through the hoops of pharmaceutical and holistic treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the book Heartburn No More it&#x27;s advised to drink 3-4 ounces of this daily before meals and at bedtime to help sooth and coat your stomach thus alleviating your GERD/acid reflux symptoms. I was blown away at the effect and am so happy to share with other folks that are suffering w/ this condition some positive &#x27;it worked for me&#x27; advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I make an ice slushee with the juice and it tastes so refreshing, so good a treat that I&#x27;ve turned other folks onto taking this juice for ALL of its medical benefits:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my recipe- enjoy! and I hope it helps. 5***** stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1-2 ounces aloe vera juice&lt;br /&gt;1 cup crushed ice&lt;br /&gt;1 stevia sugar packet and/or 6 drops agave nectar&lt;br /&gt;squeeze the juice of 1/2 fresh lemon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crush all in a blender and there you go. I chug this stuff all day/night long. Yum!</li>
            <li> I have natural 4C hair and I use this with a little water in a spray bottle to keep my hair soft and moist as I comb through for my twist outs. I also have blond highlights and it keeps my hair from drying out. My 17 year old daughter decided to go natural and she has 4A hair and she loves the way it makes her new growth feel. She is a long grow-out transitioner and it prevents breakage between the permed hair and the new growth by softening the new growth making it easier to comb out. I have even used this with a leave in conditioner and some water in a spray bottle. I like The Conditioner by Paul Mitchell.</li>
            <li> I consider this good internally and externally. I have it in a mister and use it on top of lotion and it helps it to absorb in to the skin and protects the skin from drying out so fast.</li>
            <li> I brought this to use in my hair.  Arrived cold and wrapped tightly.  I have no complaints and would buy again.</li>
            <li> In the title, and in search engine results, this product calls itself organic. However, if you look closely at the product description and label only perhaps 1% of the product is actually organic. Plus it has preservatives. Very upset. Didn&#x27;t catch this until after I received the product and cannot return it. They should not be able to advertise this as organic when it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> Brought this product to help with some digestive issues I was having. I have to say mixing it with a small glass of water during one meal a day has helped a lot. I would, however, not recommend daily consumption of this product as it can have a laxative effect as well.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday. I have acid reflux. I use this(about 3/4 cap full), along with 1 Tablespoon Psyllium Husks Powder and about 1/4 cup apple juice. This is a great help.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Use it on my hair and skin!</li>
            <li> Worked great! I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I love it for a cooling sun spray with lavender essential oil mixed in.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t drink this, I use it as a leave in conditioner for my hair and it makes it super soft instantly</li>
            <li> This aloe Vera whole leaf juice tastes nasty.  Add a little agave nectar to it and it seems much more palatable.</li>
            <li> Great  product, no  real  taste,  just being  adding  a  to  my  smoothies. Great  to  have in the  house. Body  is feeling  better.</li>
            <li> Fine for mixing into a morning cleanse drink!</li>
            <li> Not bitter-tasting as some say. Instead it  tastes like lemon juice in water...very drinkable. I  am still  waiting a little linger to see its health benefits as others have mentioned.</li>
            <li> Tastes HORRIBLE!  I thought it was the one I had before; and it isn&#x27;t.  And it is a much bigger portion as well.  Instead of taking a shot of it in the am; I will add to my shakeology!</li>
            <li> This is a staple!  It helps with lots of different health issues is a great price!  Would buy again!</li>
