            <li>Good quality fast service</li>
            <li>and they don&#x27;t bend and form to the eye easily, if at all.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay not bad looking .</li>

            <li>Super cute.  </li>
            <li>Super affordable!</li>
            <li>These were too cheap.</li>
            <li>They looked cheap and they wouldn&#x27;t stay on with any glue I tried&lt;br</li>
            <li>You need to cut them to fit your eye of course and bend them on something for a bit to make them flexible</li>
            <li>They were exceptionally cheap</li>
            <li>I absolutely swear by these!!!</li>
            <li>i wear lashes all the time not just special occassioons</li>
            <li>I love them they stay on very well on my club nights</li>
            <li>They last almost 3 days and thats good just to look like a model eveywhere you go.</li>
            <li>My daughter said they look cool</li>
            <li>The price is amazing, as I would pay many times as much to purchase the same type of lashes from anywhere else.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE the price, got here two weeks early!</li>
            <li>cheap yay will order again fast delevery also</li>
            <li>What the moneys worth and a bargain.</li>
            <li>Not even worth what I paid</li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t top notch quality but for what I paid, I won&#x27;t really complain too much.</li>
            <li>IT WORTH</li>
            <li>They are good, but obviously not real lashes</li>
            <li>Other than that there what they say and good lashes.</li>
            <li>At first time, they sent me right item as picture.</li>
            <li>They came in faster than what expected which was a huge plus!!</li>
            <li>These are pretty great for the money spent on them, but they were a little more &amp;#34;for the stage&amp;#34; than I thought they would be.</li>
            <li>My second time purchasing, and I&#x27;m so glad to have found this item and seller.</li>
            <li>and i will be buying some more for the same company</li>
            <li>I love how they have that extra band on the ends to help guide and align along your lash line.</li>
            <li>First, let me say I have been wearing falsies for about 2 Years now so ordering these are a cost saver.</li>
            <li>but these are just as good as expensive ones,dont irritate an they feel very light on my eyes</li>
            <li>They are however very thick and if cut right look great for going out.</li>
            <li>Look beautiful if you can get them to bend with your eye shape, But its pretty frustrating haha</li>
            <li>I love these lashes they are very durable and also they look good whether you are wearing something formal or casual</li>
            <li>/&gt;They&#x27;re exactly what I expected them to look like :).</li>
            <li>These are my go to lashes they last a long time ive gotten many wears out of them all u do is cut them to fit your eye</li>
            <li>Hard to apply but looks good</li>
            <li>I purchased these not expecting much for such a cheap price.</li>
            <li>I ordered these because they were cheap, &amp; I wanted something simple.</li>
            <li>they have no shape there straight as can be took forever to come</li>
            <li>i guess you cant really complain for the price.</li>
            <li>Band isn&#x27;t very flexible</li>
            <li>nd iput mascara on them too because they are very curl to take out sum curl...</li>
            <li>when yu put them on yu really can&#x27;t tell if u have lashes on till yu turn yo head....</li>
            <li>There so straight in the packaging</li>
            <li>I work mainly in theater, and the lashes are sturdy and make a huge impact, especially for actresses who don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of time applying eye makeup.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re Pretty Soft</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like they were so new</li>
            <li>Decent lashes for the price.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t look natural, or even real.</li>
            <li>For the price these are great, yes they can look fake depending on what you use them for....</li>
            <li>I disnt like the fact i had to hold on to them for more then 30seconds for them to stay on, and they wouldnt last a long time on my eye</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re long and full and curled.  </li>
            <li>The lashes where thick just like i liked them.</li>
            <li>but they are obviously too long and full to be real.</li>
            <li>These lashes are pretty and yu got ten pair for a 1 dollar ...</li>
            <li>I just pop these on them, and they instantly look glamorous and ready to leap onto the stage.</li>
            <li>Product as good as I expected at the price purchased, although the packaging was thin and cheap and crushed.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not heavy on the eyes at all.</li>
            <li>dont expect a natural look with these.</li>
            <li>They Also Came A Week Early .</li>
            <li>they are very curly ,, but I found a way to use them I sipped them to make em short</li>
            <li>Seems to be a lot of reviews complaining about the stiffness and that they don&#x27;t stay on, but that is easily fixed.  </li>
            <li>Like these because they are definitely tapered for right and left.</li>
            <li>she says they are good for dress up bu not really for everyday because they don&#x27;t feel like other lashes but like paper with fringe.</li>
            <li>so I need them to look big and bold on stage, but if you are looking for natural and hidden these are not for you.</li>
            <li>They loose their shape fast</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s kind of hard to reuse them unless u have an empty shaper to store the lashes for later use</li>
            <li>Cheap - lash band too thick</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s hard to make them fit properly.</li>
            <li>so if you want big thick lashes these are the ones to get i would probably save for parties and special occasions ......</li>

            <li> They dont stick on at all , there too straight and really stiff.</li>
            <li> These are not good if u need them quickly.  </li>
            <li> Was expecting really long ones because they took a picture that made the look longer then .what they actually are.</li>
            <li> they are pretty thick</li>
            <li> No problem with them, they just do not last as long as human lashes, which is expected.</li>
            <li> Pretty and subtle lashes</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just strange.</li>
            <li> so I gave them away to someone else who wears them that long</li>
            <li> they already have a strange curl....</li>
            <li> Had to cut them in half to look natural on my eye due to their stiffness.</li>
            <li> Now on the quality they are very long ,,longer than I expected nd hoped that will be...</li>
            <li> I would recommend these to anyone who wears false lashes as often as I do.were not all lucky with thick long lashes but these definitely help.</li>
            <li> Though this was expected for that price.</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t come already sticky so they a harder to put on on.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like them at all they were longer than expected</li>
            <li> I also am really rough on them and pull the glue off by hand instead of using chemicals or oils.</li>
            <li> ive seen cheap eyelashes before but these right here are horrible and should never be sold EVER again!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t look like real eyelashes, but I was going for a dramatic look</li>
            <li> cause their a little long</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m let down by that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are super thick and do feel really fake</li>
            <li> Some of the bargain lashes are stiff so be patient and careful with placement  and</li>
            <li> They are also flared at the ends which makes them extra long which is really dramatic, but can appear to others as &amp;#34;unnatural&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> And They Give A Dramatic But Not Too Wild Look .</li>
            <li> these have a black band  </li>
            <li> half the product was sticking out of the envelope and that the box was all sticky and banged up.</li>
            <li> Okay they are like Barbie doll eye lashes not good nor bad</li>
            <li> My girlfriend was missing 2 out of here and didnr appreciate it.</li>
            <li> Hard to put on due to the fact they are so stiff</li>
            <li> Stiff and misshapen. ..</li>
            <li> Yes, they are stiff-</li>
            <li> They are not flexible and are not easy to adjust.</li>
            <li> it will not let you down!!</li>
            <li> Bad quality do not feel like real eyelashes.</li>
            <li> They were packaged poorly but, I&#x27;ve managed to wear a couple pairs from this purchase but, after using one time they&#x27;re really not made to be worn again.</li>
            <li> I mean I still use them almost everyday</li>
            <li> Its hard to glue these on sometime</li>
            <li> I have a hard time bending them and molding then to eye shape.</li>
            <li> Also, hard to get glued on.</li>
            <li> My only disappointment is that the packaging  does not have the lashes on the shapers</li>
            <li> A bit too thick</li>
            <li> Too thick</li>
            <li> No shape, too thick to glue on.</li>
            <li> I wear false eyelashes a few times per month, when I&#x27;ve some place to go.</li>
            <li> Each pair roughly last for a week (sometimes longer) which isn&#x27;t bad for the price you pay compared to drug stores / beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li> The lashes are stiff and difficult to put on.  </li>
            <li> they are a weird texture and they are stiff.</li>
            <li> Very hard and not a flexible band.</li>
            <li> but she was not happy when she got the packaging.</li>
            <li> I like  the  false  eyelashes.</li>
            <li> If you want dramatic lashes, get these.</li>
            <li> They are just not wonderful.  </li>
            <li> sad</li>
            <li> And not waist my money on expensive store lashes that are nothing compared to these.</li>
            <li> Horrible just straight up terrible</li>
            <li> They are very fake looking</li>
            <li> Bad quality.</li>
            <li> /&gt;.. :(</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Worst eyelashes ever.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Super cute.  Will be buying more!</li>
            <li> They are just not wonderful.  Was expecting really long ones because they took a picture that made the look longer then .what they actually are. They have a lot of curl to them so it..it&#x27;s just strange. I mean I still use them almost everyday and I&#x27;ve found ways to make the better with mascara, but I probably won&#x27;t be buying them again.</li>
            <li> Stiff and misshapen. ..</li>
            <li> These are my go to lashes they last a long time ive gotten many wears out of them all u do is cut them to fit your eye cause their a little long but these are just as good as expensive ones,dont irritate an they feel very light on my eyes</li>
            <li> My second time purchasing, and I&#x27;m so glad to have found this item and seller. They are high-quality and can be reused if removed and stored properly. I work mainly in theater, and the lashes are sturdy and make a huge impact, especially for actresses who don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of time applying eye makeup. I just pop these on them, and they instantly look glamorous and ready to leap onto the stage. The price is amazing, as I would pay many times as much to purchase the same type of lashes from anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Hard to put on due to the fact they are so stiff</li>
            <li> Product as good as I expected at the price purchased, although the packaging was thin and cheap and crushed.</li>
            <li> i just love the lashes, they are very good quality and fit perfectly and i will be buying some more for the same company</li>
            <li> Awsomeee n cheap yay will order again fast delevery also</li>
            <li> They looked so plastic.ðŸ‘Ž</li>
            <li> Meh, They are good for practice. Look beautiful if you can get them to bend with your eye shape, But its pretty frustrating haha</li>
            <li> Very cheap eyelashes.</li>
            <li> A bit too thick and they don&#x27;t bend and form to the eye easily, if at all. Though this was expected for that price. They don&#x27;t look natural, or even real.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. Bad quality.</li>
            <li> They loose their shape fast</li>
            <li> they were nice beautiful will order more</li>
            <li> for its price its grate !</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t look like real eyelashes, but I was going for a dramatic look so I&#x27;m let down by that. They don&#x27;t look plastic but they are obviously too long and full to be real.</li>
            <li> Some of the bargain lashes are stiff so be patient and careful with placement  and they;ll be fine. Like these because they are definitely tapered for right and left.</li>
            <li> What the moneys worth and a bargain. Pretty and subtle lashes I would recommend these to anyone who wears false lashes as often as I do.were not all lucky with thick long lashes but these definitely help.</li>
            <li> I like them, plastic but you can get away with them.</li>
            <li> I ordered these because they were cheap, &amp; I wanted something simple. It took about 35 days to get to me. I was worried because I&#x27;m taking a photoshoot tomorrow, they came today. Before, I opened the package I saw them &amp; was like ohhhh okay they look decent, but nooo I opened the package and they felt like black paper. Smh, y&#x27;all need to stop lying on these reviews.</li>
            <li> Love them. They&#x27;re not heavy on the eyes at all.</li>
            <li> The lashes are stiff and difficult to put on.  Not what I was hoping for. Not what I wanted at all.</li>
            <li> Horrible just straight up terrible they don&#x27;t stay on my eye shape they have no shape there straight as can be took forever to come all 10 pairs are in the garbitch</li>
            <li> love these lashes! and I LOVE the price, got here two weeks early! had no problem putting them on. I&#x27;ve gotten numerous compliments on them. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li> These were too cheap. They looked cheap and they wouldn&#x27;t stay on with any glue I tried&lt;br /&gt;.. :( sad</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay not bad looking .</li>
            <li> Looks so plastic. And feels like it&#x27;s gonna fall apart. Not even worth what I paid I think.</li>
            <li> This item does look like the picture I was very pleased with that. Only problem was the shipment time. These are not good if u need them quickly.  All in all pretty good.</li>
            <li> Love it def what I use for photo shoot a these lashes are my go to and I can&#x27;t  complain.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend was missing 2 out of here and didnr appreciate it. We bought it and didnt get everything smh</li>
            <li> Love the lashes can&#x27;t beat the price for the quality. I will buy all my lashes from here. And not waist my money on expensive store lashes that are nothing compared to these.</li>
            <li> They dont stick on at all , there too straight and really stiff. I dont like them at all.  Next</li>
            <li> Love these lashes , very light weight and easy to put on</li>
            <li> Too thick and they don&#x27;t come already sticky so they a harder to put on on.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like them at all they were longer than expected so I gave them away to someone else who wears them that long</li>
            <li> These eyelashes do not stay on. they are a weird texture and they are stiff. They are not flexible and are not easy to adjust. I tried using one pair and ended up throwing it all away. i guess you cant really complain for the price.</li>
            <li> You need to cut them to fit your eye of course and bend them on something for a bit to make them flexible</li>
            <li> At first time, they sent me right item as picture. I ordered it again, this time it was different. I don&#x27;t like these.</li>
            <li> I love em ! Especially for the price</li>
            <li> I disnt like the fact i had to hold on to them for more then 30seconds for them to stay on, and they wouldnt last a long time on my eye they started to peel off thats why i give i 1 star</li>
            <li> Its hard to glue these on sometime but when they are on, its gorgeous</li>
            <li> My mom uses these and she loves them.</li>
            <li> I absolutely swear by these!!! I love them! Great for beginners and very manageable for experts!!! The quality and quaint it will not let you down!!</li>
            <li> Love them! i will buy more</li>
            <li> Cheap - lash band too thick</li>
            <li> these require to be cut to size. they are great for the price. dont expect a natural look with these. i wear lashes all the time not just special occassioons so these are for when i go to the store etc....back ups... i wore these last time i was at walmart and the cashier said i had great lashes and asked were they real and said they looked like my own! these have a black band  so i blend with liquid liner.</li>
            <li> These are pretty great for the money spent on them, but they were a little more &amp;#34;for the stage&amp;#34; than I thought they would be. If you want dramatic lashes, get these. I&#x27;ll be using these with my costumes.</li>
            <li> LOVE THESE! Easy to apply and they look beautiful!</li>
            <li> I love them they stay on very well on my club nights</li>
            <li> Worst eyelashes ever. No shape, too thick to glue on.</li>
            <li> Had to cut them in half to look natural on my eye due to their stiffness. They are very fake looking but okay for the cheap price. They are however very thick and if cut right look great for going out. Definitely reusable. If you&#x27;re looking for better quality, you should try kiss lashes. Yes you spend more but they look a lot better.</li>
            <li> Definitely Great For The Price.  They&#x27;re Pretty Soft And They Give A Dramatic But Not Too Wild Look . They Also Came A Week Early .</li>
            <li> I love these lashes they are very durable and also they look good whether you are wearing something formal or casual I would recommend these eyelashes to anyone!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t even feel like eyelashes they more like plastics.i don&#x27;t recommend anyone to buy this product it&#x27;s very cheap and plastic don&#x27;t feel or look like lashes</li>
            <li> they are pretty thick so if you want big thick lashes these are the ones to get i would probably save for parties and special occasions ......</li>
            <li> I wear false eyelashes a few times per month, when I&#x27;ve some place to go. These aren&#x27;t top notch quality but for what I paid, I won&#x27;t really complain too much. They&#x27;ve served their purpose.</li>
            <li> These lashes are beautiful. I just received them in the mail today. They came in faster than what expected which was a huge plus!! They feel AMAZING and I don&#x27;t think that I will ever purchase any from any where else! They are nice and full and easy to put on. I love how they have that extra band on the ends to help guide and align along your lash line. They are very good quality for the price!! I definitely love these lashes.</li>
            <li> They are...Okay they are like Barbie doll eye lashes not good nor bad they are just okay. If you just want longer lashes then this is it..</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my daughter and she loves them!</li>
            <li> No problem with them, they just do not last as long as human lashes, which is expected.</li>
            <li> No star at all. I hate them! Do not buy</li>
            <li> These lashes are pretty and yu got ten pair for a 1 dollar ... Now on the quality they are very long ,,longer than I expected nd hoped that will be... Band isn&#x27;t very flexible nd they are very curly ,, but I found a way to use them I sipped them to make em short nd iput mascara on them too because they are very curl to take out sum curl... Yu might want to do this because of band not being flexible nd they already have a strange curl....when yu put them on yu really can&#x27;t tell if u have lashes on till yu turn yo head.... O yea prolly wouldn&#x27;t  buy again idk</li>
            <li> The lashes where thick just like i liked them. They last almost 3 days and thats good just to look like a model eveywhere you go.</li>
            <li> Bad quality do not feel like real eyelashes. Very hard and not a flexible band. worst eyelashes I&#x27;ve ever owned. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> They work well.you do need to cut them a bit but that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> Good quality fast service</li>
            <li> Beautiful lashesðŸ’œ.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re exactly what I expected them to look like :).</li>
            <li> Love the way it look .. I am into eyelash now .. Very happy</li>
            <li> My only disappointment is that the packaging  does not have the lashes on the shapers so it&#x27;s kind of hard to reuse them unless u have an empty shaper to store the lashes for later use</li>
            <li> horrible, plastic eyelashes... ive seen cheap eyelashes before but these right here are horrible and should never be sold EVER again!</li>
            <li> First, let me say I have been wearing falsies for about 2 Years now so ordering these are a cost saver. Each pair roughly last for a week (sometimes longer) which isn&#x27;t bad for the price you pay compared to drug stores / beauty supply stores. I also am really rough on them and pull the glue off by hand instead of using chemicals or oils. They might last longer if you did that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are super thick and do feel really fake so if you are not into that these are not for you. They are also flared at the ends which makes them extra long which is really dramatic, but can appear to others as &amp;#34;unnatural&amp;#34;. They also do take awhile to arrive so be patient! It takes about 2-3 weeks to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I got that out of the way...&lt;br /&gt;I like them! They are easy to put on for me and they look fabulous! Super affordable!</li>
            <li> Hard to apply but looks good</li>
            <li> Great lashes. Only 1 thing about them I didn&#x27;t really like they were so new I have a hard time bending them and molding then to eye shape. There so straight in the packaging it&#x27;s hard to make them fit properly. Other than that there what they say and good lashes.</li>
            <li> I purchased these not expecting much for such a cheap price. However, they arrived several days later than the set date I was told. They were packaged poorly but, I&#x27;ve managed to wear a couple pairs from this purchase but, after using one time they&#x27;re really not made to be worn again. But, overall I feel like I got what I paid for. They were exceptionally cheap so I can&#x27;t expect best quality. You get what u pay for.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Love &#x27;em!&amp;#34; I create art from discarded lottery tickets and I use this in some of my Etsy projects.</li>
            <li> For the price these are great, yes they can look fake depending on what you use them for.... I use them for theatre so I need them to look big and bold on stage, but if you are looking for natural and hidden these are not for you.</li>
            <li> Decent lashes for the price.</li>
            <li> These are Fabulous!  Yes, they are stiff- but- you need to flex and bend them up a bit prior to applying on.  Once they are on, they stay on.  They&#x27;re long and full and curled.  I love them.  Seems to be a lot of reviews complaining about the stiffness and that they don&#x27;t stay on, but that is easily fixed.  Just flex/bend them a bit and apply plenty of glue.  Works perfectly.  I use them daily and get complemented on them all the time!</li>
            <li> My daughter said they look cool but she was not happy when she got the packaging. half the product was sticking out of the envelope and that the box was all sticky and banged up. she says they are good for dress up bu not really for everyday because they don&#x27;t feel like other lashes but like paper with fringe.</li>
            <li> I love these lashes. They can be used several times with proper removal and storage. I get lots of complimentsðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> These are great... If the look you&#x27;re going for is&lt;br /&gt;Miss Piggy. Never again.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT WORTH EVERY PENNY THANK U THANK U THANK U</li>
            <li> They are good, but obviously not real lashes once you get them on. Also, hard to get glued on. But for the money and for cosplay or cosruming it works well, just not for every day wear.</li>
            <li> I like  the  false  eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I bought about 10 of these boxes, love them all!!</li>
