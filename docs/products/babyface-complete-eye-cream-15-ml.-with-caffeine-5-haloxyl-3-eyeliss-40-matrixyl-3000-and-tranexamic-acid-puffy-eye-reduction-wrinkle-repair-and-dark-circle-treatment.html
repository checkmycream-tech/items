            <li>Amazing results.</li>
            <li>My face absorbs it quickly which is the sign of a good eyecream.  </li>
            <li>Okay.  </li>
            <li>Love it for going to sleep time, but not under my make up</li>
            <li>The longer you use it, the better your results are.</li>
            <li>Overall an excellent product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I love the creaminess of this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i definetely recommend this one, because there are many eye creams out there that doesnt do anything</li>
            <li>Seems to be working ok.</li>
            <li>but it seems ok to me.  </li>
            <li>but I think there is better products in the market.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE how it&#x27;s so soothing around my eyes when I put it on.</li>
            <li>I have been using a variety of BabyFace products for two months now and am extremely pleased with the products and their performance.  </li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s never too early to start with good skin care products!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s important because it takes the specified amount of the peptide to provide the results.</li>
            <li>It leaves the area around my eyes feeling smooth and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to try this thinking it would be the answer to my puffiness...</li>
            <li>It works ok on my fine lines but the search for my real issue continues.</li>
            <li>It is great for people who are sensitive to certain eye creams, and it reduced the puffiness and wrinkles around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s four ingredients used to be the four ingredients in the original formula for Hydrolyze by Hydroxotone, but Hydrolyze changed and the new formula no longer is as effective as Babyface.  </li>
            <li>and I have gone back to the Elings with great success.</li>
            <li>add an update later if I see good results.</li>
            <li>Is a great product to bring down the puffiness in the morning.</li>
            <li>, Babyface is my new love.  </li>
            <li>I am really very please with this company!!</li>
            <li>It feels smooth to the skin and doesn&#x27;t require much of it.</li>
            <li>have been through hundreds of dollars worth of eye creams.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s well worth the price of admission.</li>
            <li>This cream is the best I have found to minimize the tired look around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>So far I love this cream...</li>
            <li>The texture is fast absorbing refreshing and cooling.</li>
            <li>It has no perfume which is great for my sensitive skin, I just cannot say enough about this cream.  </li>
            <li>It seems to melt right into my skin</li>
            <li>, maybe it just wasn&#x27;t the right one for me.</li>
            <li>I have used Elings Eye Serenity for years and thought maybe this would be good because it has the ingredient for dark circles that Eye Serenity does not have.  </li>
            <li>I still have a lot more left.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t exactly work miracles instantly but it is a million times better than anything I have used before.</li>
            <li>This eye cream is exactly what I&#x27;ve been searching for.</li>
            <li>when you first start using it, you will probably see immediate results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I order this product after been reading lots of review, first all the ingredients are natural, I really love organics and natural products.</li>
            <li>it is super soft, absorbent, and has no aroma.</li>
            <li>not perfect but a nice eye cream, very light nongreasy</li>
            <li>however this products does do a great job of daily hydration for my eyes which have a tendency to be a little crepey (sp?)</li>
            <li>And again, as much as I fall for all these promising products I can&#x27;t find anything that helps.</li>
            <li>This product really works if you apply it before your foundation.</li>
            <li>and it really shows around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>and I can really notice the reduction in my eye bags.</li>
            <li>It has really helped the skin around my eyes tighten.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very allergic to fragrances</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t used much as yet</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and in my late 40&#x27;s but would recommend this product for all skin tones &amp; ages.</li>
            <li>Most other creams that I&#x27;ve researched don&#x27;t list the percentage of these ingredients.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on my sensitive eyes and seems to smooth the upper eye lid.  </li>
            <li>and I have noticed that the dark circles under my eyes are getting better.</li>
            <li>so I have to be careful with anything around my eyes, as they will water easily.</li>
            <li>There are much better eye creams, even if a bit more expensive.</li>
            <li>I am of Indian decent.</li>
            <li>It is very soft and non-irritating to my eyes and I will continue to use it and see what happens!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it for a short time but it is such a nice cream.</li>
            <li>My fine lines are extremely dimished</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my eyes look and the fact that a tiny bit goes a very long way.</li>
            <li>I am 55 years old, and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice eye cream (a little on the expensive side for a cheap girl like me).  </li>
            <li>I even use it around my mouth where I don&#x27;t have fine lines but have developed a slight droop off the corners of my mouth.  </li>
            <li>I use it everyday even on the fine lines on my face and around my mouth.</li>
            <li>I guess everyone reacts different to certain products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>if I see any changes, so therefore I cant really rate properly.</li>
            <li>I purchased this cream and the night retinol directly from Babyface web site.</li>
            <li>So far I would recommend all of the Babyface products including this one.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Babyface products for some time now and have found all the products to be worth the money spent.  </li>
            <li>This is the only eye cream that literally brightens my undereye area, erases dark circles, and eliminates fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this product about three weeks, but am already seeing an improvement in the skin and lightening of the dark circle under my eyes, which was my primary concern.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product for the first time 2 yrs ago, and just had to purchase this item for the second time 2 yrs later using it once a day.  </li>
            <li>This actually made my eyes look more tired.</li>
            <li>The price may seem high but it will last a very long time.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t use as much concealer now that the dark circles are diminishing.</li>
            <li>Seemed to work well on minimizing puffiness although I didn&#x27;t see any real change to my dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and have noticed a visible change in the dark circles that have plagued me for so long.  </li>

            <li> Just got it 3 dys ago and very emollient not sure if it will help fade wrinkles yet</li>
            <li> It did nothing for my baggy eyes, wrinkles,  and dark circles, so I am surprised to see the 5 star reviews.</li>
            <li> This hasn&#x27;t worked miracles - but I also haven&#x27;t used it that long either.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with Babyface...as long as it doesn&#x27;t change!  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m hoping it will melt away my dark circles at the same time!&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I have very dry under eye skin.  </li>
            <li> I have tried every eye cream out there and have spent a fortune.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This product did nothing for my dark circles and not much of a moisturizer either.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, my lines and dark circles still exist.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> My eyes look brighter now that I don&#x27;t have the dark circles anymore</li>
            <li> but I have noticed that the dark circles under my eyes have diminished since using this eye cream.  </li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t made any difference in the dark circles or puffiness.</li>
            <li> Helps reduce puffiness, lightens up dark circles AND brightens the skin around your eyes.</li>
            <li> Helps reduce puffiness, lightens up dark circles AND brightens the skin around your eyes.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for the dark circles.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any change in the dark circles either.</li>
            <li> It did not keep the puffiness down for me</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;bags&amp;#34; are much less visible.</li>
            <li> they are gone in less than two weeks.  </li>
            <li> While I have never used Babyface in the past I believe this may be my lifelong beauty regime.  </li>
            <li> Little pricy for the amount of product, but it lasts forever.  </li>
            <li> This one is a waste of money, doesn&#x27;t do anything that it claims.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money  </li>
            <li> The container looks small but you need just a little dub under your eyes to get the job done.</li>
            <li> , Ill try all once and see if it works , I hope this does since it has hype, I do like its deep eye moisturizing</li>
            <li> I am not impressed and may ask for my money back.</li>
            <li> I am 45 and have crows feet and small lines under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I cannot believe the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of eye creams for tired, baggy, puffy eyes.  </li>
            <li> Though I should or everyone will find out the secret and it will be sold out everywhere.  </li>
            <li> Does nothing at all for puffiness and contains horrible silicones which are cleverly listed as crosspolymer.&lt;br /&gt;I looked that word up</li>
            <li> useless, absolutely useless.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is my second order of this product.  I love how it makes my eyes look and the fact that a tiny bit goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> Just got it 3 dys ago and very emollient not sure if it will help fade wrinkles yet and it moisturizes but I don&#x27;t see an instant lift or anything, Ill try all once and see if it works , I hope this does since it has hype, I do like its deep eye moisturizing</li>
            <li> Not worth the money. There are much better eye creams, even if a bit more expensive. This one is a waste of money, doesn&#x27;t do anything that it claims.</li>
            <li> Okay.  Finally, an eye cream that works for me.  I cannot believe the negative reviews.  I guess everyone reacts different to certain products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been through hundreds of dollars worth of eye creams.  I was using Andrea, which for the life of me, I don&#x27;t know why they discontinued that eye cream.  It was only $9.00 and worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Babyface is my new love.  I only use it once a day over and under my eyes.  It is great for people who are sensitive to certain eye creams, and it reduced the puffiness and wrinkles around my eyes.  As with any eye creams, pat it on, and do not put it on too close to your eye.  I am 55 years old, and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for over a month now and I have noticed that the dark circles under my eyes are getting better. My eyes look brighter now that I don&#x27;t have the dark circles anymore and I don&#x27;t use as much concealer now that the dark circles are diminishing. The container looks small but you need just a little dub under your eyes to get the job done. I still have a lot more left. I will be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wear this during the day because it pills up around the eye. Love it for going to sleep time, but not under my make up</li>
            <li> Took me a while to write this review, I wanted to see if it worked.  It does, it takes time but I have noticed that the dark circles under my eyes have diminished since using this eye cream.  Additionally, the puffiness under my eyes has decrease as well.  Patience is the key to using this product, it doesn&#x27;t work over night.  Give it two to three weeks to see improvement .  I recommend this cream and it&#x27;s well worth the price of admission.</li>
            <li> Seemed to work well on minimizing puffiness although I didn&#x27;t see any real change to my dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a month and don&#x27;t see results.&lt;br /&gt;I guess you have to use it for months to see results, or not?</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I use it everyday even on the fine lines on my face and around my mouth. Amazing results.</li>
            <li> useless, absolutely useless. Maybe I expect wonders. And again, as much as I fall for all these promising products I can&#x27;t find anything that helps. And this product just came on my list. Sorry.</li>
            <li> This product really works if you apply it before your foundation. Other than that, my lines and dark circles still exist. FYI.. I am of Indian decent.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t exactly work miracles instantly but it is a million times better than anything I have used before. The longer you use it, the better your results are. Overall an excellent product.</li>
            <li> Purchased BabyFace eye cream after reading reviews and researching Eyeliss, an ingrediant in this eye cream.  Very disappointed as I have been using it for 30 days and have seen NO difference in the skin around the eye area. Would not purchase it again.  Still looking for an eye cream or serum to reduce puffiness under the eye.</li>
            <li> Am on my second one of this product.  It&#x27;s gentle on my sensitive eyes and seems to smooth the upper eye lid.  Not a miracle maker, but what cream is that?!</li>
            <li> I just started to use it dont know yet if I see any changes, so therefore I cant really rate properly.</li>
            <li> Excellent one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of eye creams for tired, baggy, puffy eyes.  Sometimes I don&#x27;t sleep well and it really shows around my eyes.  This cream is the best I have found to minimize the tired look around my eyes.  I will continue to use as the product works for me well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product about three weeks, but am already seeing an improvement in the skin and lightening of the dark circle under my eyes, which was my primary concern.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice eye cream (a little on the expensive side for a cheap girl like me).  I got it because it had the &amp;#34;eyeless&amp;#34; ingredient.  My allergies have been killing me and my eyes have been on the puffy side.  This hasn&#x27;t worked miracles - but I also haven&#x27;t used it that long either.  It is very soft and non-irritating to my eyes and I will continue to use it and see what happens!</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t made any difference in the dark circles or puffiness. I use it day and night as directed and nothing.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> The photo is of a size twice as big as what you get.&lt;br /&gt;So not that great a deal.  I returned it</li>
            <li> This eye cream is exactly what I&#x27;ve been searching for. I learned about eyeliss and haloxyl and discovered that these are the ingredients that are needed to reduce under eye bags. It contains 3% eyeliss and 5% haloxyl. Most other creams that I&#x27;ve researched don&#x27;t list the percentage of these ingredients. That&#x27;s important because it takes the specified amount of the peptide to provide the results. The price is incredible. Fast shipping. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3-1/2 weeks and I can really notice the reduction in my eye bags. I will continue to use this product. I&#x27;m so pleased with this product. Note to Babyface: DON&#x27;T EVER STOP MAKING THIS!!</li>
            <li> not perfect but a nice eye cream, very light nongreasy</li>
            <li> It has really helped the skin around my eyes tighten. The &amp;#34;bags&amp;#34; are much less visible. I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> So far I love this cream...it is super soft, absorbent, and has no aroma. I&#x27;m very allergic to fragrances so I have to be careful with anything around my eyes, as they will water easily.I&#x27;ve only used it for a short time but it is such a nice cream. It seems to melt right into my skin and I&#x27;m hoping it will melt away my dark circles at the same time!&lt;br /&gt;Will add an update later if I see good results.</li>
            <li> I love the creaminess of this product.  It leaves the area around my eyes feeling smooth and moisturized.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any &amp;#34;lightening&amp;#34; around my eye area, but my eye makeup does seem to go on smoother.  The only problem I&#x27;ve noticed with this eye cream is that when I put it on before bed, it has actually left bleach-type stains on my pillowcase, so you may not want to wear it to bed.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this thinking it would be the answer to my puffiness...This actually made my eyes look more tired. For me, it did not help the puffiness at all and made my eye makeup \\&quot;slip away\\&quot; through out the day. Now I am stuck with it because Amazon won&#x27;t accept returns on this type of product.  Overrated!</li>
            <li> This product did nothing for my dark circles and not much of a moisturizer either.  Used it for months. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Helps reduce puffiness, lightens up dark circles AND brightens the skin around your eyes. Just love it!This cream is beautiful</li>
            <li> This is the only eye cream that literally brightens my undereye area, erases dark circles, and eliminates fine lines.  It&#x27;s four ingredients used to be the four ingredients in the original formula for Hydrolyze by Hydroxotone, but Hydrolyze changed and the new formula no longer is as effective as Babyface.  I&#x27;ll stick with Babyface...as long as it doesn&#x27;t change!  I&#x27;m a 49-year-old female.</li>
            <li> when you first start using it, you will probably see immediate results.&lt;br /&gt;i am almost done using all of it, and the caffeine helps with the vein suppression under the eyes&lt;br /&gt;i definetely recommend this one, because there are many eye creams out there that doesnt do anything but this one does!</li>
            <li> Was not impressed by any change after one jar.</li>
            <li> Horrible product and it hurt my eyes, I just threw it away.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this eye cream to anyone.  The price may seem high but it will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I have been using Babyface products for some time now and have found all the products to be worth the money spent.  Little pricy for the amount of product, but it lasts forever.  I really like this product and have noticed a visible change in the dark circles that have plagued me for so long.  It does happen over time. I purchased this product for the first time 2 yrs ago, and just had to purchase this item for the second time 2 yrs later using it once a day.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working ok. Skin looks good but i am still breaking out.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used much as yet but it seems ok to me.  It feels smooth to the skin and doesn&#x27;t require much of it.</li>
            <li> I read all reviews and it seemed to work great but I&#x27;m not really impressed.  It is good but I think there is better products in the market.  Give it a try, maybe it just wasn&#x27;t the right one for me.</li>
            <li> This cream is beautiful. A little goes a long way. I use it morning and night along with Babyface Night Renewal Cream. I LOVE how it&#x27;s so soothing around my eyes when I put it on. Helps reduce puffiness, lightens up dark circles AND brightens the skin around your eyes. Just love it!</li>
            <li> Used this now for five weeks. It works ok on my fine lines but the search for my real issue continues. Did nothing for the dark circles.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE!!  Don&#x27;t waste your money  Saw no results in 2 months usage!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this cream and the night retinol directly from Babyface web site. I am not impressed and may ask for my money back. It did nothing for my baggy eyes, wrinkles,  and dark circles, so I am surprised to see the 5 star reviews.</li>
            <li> I order this product after been reading lots of review, first all the ingredients are natural, I really love organics and natural products. I am so happy with the results. The texture is fast absorbing refreshing and cooling. Is a great product to bring down the puffiness in the morning. I am really very please with this company!! On my way to order more of their products!!</li>
            <li> Does nothing at all for puffiness and contains horrible silicones which are cleverly listed as crosspolymer.&lt;br /&gt;I looked that word up and it is pore clogging silicone. Yuk!</li>
            <li> I have used Elings Eye Serenity for years and thought maybe this would be good because it has the ingredient for dark circles that Eye Serenity does not have.  It did not keep the puffiness down for me and I have gone back to the Elings with great success.</li>
            <li> I have been using a variety of BabyFace products for two months now and am extremely pleased with the products and their performance.  No-I don&#x27;t suddenly look 20 years younger however this products does do a great job of daily hydration for my eyes which have a tendency to be a little crepey (sp?) from the skin thinning and not retaining moisture. This product works better than others I have tried and the price point is great!  So far I would recommend all of the Babyface products including this one.  I am fair skinned and in my late 40&#x27;s but would recommend this product for all skin tones &amp; ages. It&#x27;s never too early to start with good skin care products!</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me.  I have very dry under eye skin.  The product didn&#x27;t provide moisturizing.  I didn&#x27;t notice any change in the dark circles either.</li>
            <li> too soon to rate results</li>
            <li> I am 45 and have crows feet and small lines under my eyes.  I use Baby face on my eyes after using the babyface nightcream.  While I have never used Babyface in the past I believe this may be my lifelong beauty regime.  I have tried every eye cream out there and have spent a fortune.  Babyface makes my skin dewy without being greasy.  My fine lines are extremely dimished and I have only been using it for two weeks.  This is the best eye cream out there today in my opinion.  My face absorbs it quickly which is the sign of a good eyecream.  It has no perfume which is great for my sensitive skin, I just cannot say enough about this cream.  Though I should or everyone will find out the secret and it will be sold out everywhere.  I even use it around my mouth where I don&#x27;t have fine lines but have developed a slight droop off the corners of my mouth.  Not anyomore they are gone in less than two weeks.  Love, Love, Love it.</li>
