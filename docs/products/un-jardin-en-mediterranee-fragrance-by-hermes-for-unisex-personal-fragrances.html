            <li>and I smell delicious!</li>
            <li>SOPHISTICATED!!!</li>
            <li>Great Price, great perfume!</li>
            <li>try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent develops beautifully on the skin, or stays \\&quot;cleaner\\&quot; sprayed on clothing.</li>
            <li>This perfume is quite pricey in retail stores in the US, but is a great price on Amazon</li>
            <li>I am in love with this perfume!!  </li>
            <li>Great product (the wife loves it) plus no transaction problems; makes for good business.  </li>
            <li>but this is a pleasant change of pace.</li>
            <li>cyprus and cedar and bergamot with a dose of sea breeze and for good measure.</li>
            <li>I have always loved Hermes Un Jardin En Mediterranee and have worn it for years.</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>Hmmmm, This smells really good, you will love it as I did!!&lt;br /&gt;Happy customer!! : )</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to wear this when I go shopping to see if I get a reaction because I LOVE the way I smell!</li>
            <li>This arrived in excellent condition and absolutely was the highlight of her Mother&#x27;s Day!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>Another amazing Amazon purchase.</li>
            <li>This stunning fragrance just lifts my spirits - so fresh and feminine - was so impressed with the suppliers efficiency of  delivery to Australia.</li>
            <li>The sillage was nice because I wasn&#x27;t too close</li>
            <li>/&gt;Others have aptly described the makeup of the scent itself, decide if it appeals to you, but know from a Trained Chemist and an olfactory savant that this scent is sublime.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because it has so many of my very favorite scents combined.</li>
            <li>Although it was advertised as suitable for both genders</li>
            <li>Better than Premier Figuier in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>pretty nice!</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>-I don&#x27;t want to type this many, but amazon is making me.</li>
            <li>It is an outstanding fragrance.  </li>
            <li>We already knew this product, it is my wife&#x27;s favorite.  </li>
            <li>Un Jardin sur le Nil by Hermes and Jean-Claude remains my top choice</li>
            <li>Thank you Amazon for securing the Hermes scents so that we can enjoy a bit of luxury in these hard-pressed times!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite scent in years.</li>
            <li>This stage is probably my favorite.</li>
            <li>Fresh bergamot breeze and spray of juicy mandarin are replaced by the bright play of floral notes,</li>
            <li>Original and stylish fragrance for the summer!</li>
            <li>The most important part of any fragrance is to use natural ingredients, that&#x27;s why Hermes (and e.g. Guerlain) are so wonderful -</li>
            <li>It is so refreshing and &amp;#34;young&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s more for lady though.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good bit different than I thought it would be, but very nice.  </li>
            <li>I give this 5 stars because I love it and originally purchased it 7 years ago in Morocco.  </li>
            <li>and it arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is lately the best perfume that came to the market, the trough Meditarianin smell, remindes me on those nice vaccactions at see side on Mediteranian cost.</li>
            <li>Is a lotion available?</li>
            <li>I feel the  breathe of sea, light of sunrays and scent of Mediterranean flowers.  </li>
            <li>Very fresh smell.</li>
            <li>Un Jardin en Mediterranee is a very refreshing and interesting smell, not the usual one and still very interesting after two years of using it.</li>
            <li>Un Jardin En Mediterranee by Hermes is something unique, it makes people turn around.</li>
            <li>Decent for men as well, but iconic for bold, confident ladies.</li>
            <li>It is subdued, sweet, and unique.</li>
            <li>Most perfumiers today create semi-synthetic or fully synthetic scents to be cloying, that&#x27;s why elevators smell of a foul-smelling scent that has affinity for your sinus membranes, it&#x27;s pure chemistry.</li>
            <li>I love the whole &amp;#34;garden&amp;#34; collection.</li>
            <li>You will notice this right away with a scent such as the aptly named E T E R N</li>
            <li>I try to just buy from Amazon distribution, since  can balk if things aren&#x27;t right.  </li>
            <li>This entire line is very unique and Un Jardin en Mediterranee is a complex fragrance that is not for all, but perfect for moi, who doesn&#x27;t care for women&#x27;s perfume much.</li>
            <li>I have the ReAL THInG!  </li>
            <li>, I have to use more, and I definitely prefer the Eau des Merveilles, to this</li>
            <li>&quot; I wondered, but lo and behold, I tried some scents from the famous French designer.</li>
            <li>I bought this perfume when I have been to Greece for the first time.</li>
            <li>The perfume is pertinent for business meeting and first date, it suits for day or evening.</li>
            <li>Great perfume  product that has a long lasting scent.</li>
            <li>if you are interested in purchasing this but have never smelled it, try it out in a retail store first.  </li>
            <li>It possesses by mysterious magnetism, I love every drop of this bouquet, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>You will  certainly buy it from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Jean Claude Ellena has created another lovely, dry, very wearable fragrance for all of us.</li>
            <li>when you buy scent on line, the greatest fear is that it will be a  FAKE item, not only was this the Genuine Article, but it was new, and the packaging was fresh,crisp  </li>
            <li>I remember it being clean, soft, sweet and somewhat different.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This product arrived fast and smells absolutely divine.  </li>
            <li>Mmmmmmmmmm, it is absolutely wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast shipment.</li>
            <li>and I got the real deal</li>
            <li>honey sweet of figs  is set off by slight bitterness of juniper, cedar and cool tranquility of cypress.</li>
            <li>Everything is fine so far,  just need to compare it to the actual scent from Neimanns that I sprayed to insure</li>
            <li>It smells different, the color is darker and the scent does not last more than 10 mins.  </li>
            <li>She told me it was Hermes but \\&quot;forgot\\&quot; the name of the particular fragrance.</li>
            <li>Next, the heart is more floral fruity with the fig and white oleander coming out.</li>
            <li>It is also the best in the Jardin line according to my nose--a melange of fig (base note), cedar, hot pepper, tomato, and Mediterranean herbs.  </li>
            <li>You are left with a mellow cedarwood with traces of mild fruit to enjoy over the next several hours.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife in Paris when it was brand new, before it was released in the US.  </li>
            <li>If you have worn Un Jardin Sur Le Toit, I find it similar but without the green apple base and more hot pepper, thus more interesting and intriguing.  </li>
            <li>When first sprayed on the wrist, the citrus tickles your nose and is swiftly followed by the raisin-y, figgy middle notes.</li>
            <li>Please do not waste your money!</li>
            <li>they use natural essences, not aromatic chemicals.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;a chacun - son gout!\\&quot;  Un Jardin En Mediterranee is a more complex scent and longer-lasting due to its composition, but as pure as air on a deserted beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I live in a politically correct marketplace where people will bark at you if your perfume aggravates their perfume allergies.</li>
            <li>I similarly have worn Eau d&#x27;Orange Vert similarly since it was released as Eau d&#x27;Hermes, much longer ago.  </li>
            <li>I first put it on, it is sharp.</li>
            <li>I like a scent that is sensual and yummy, but is soft enough to keep the perfume police at bay!</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re tired of sweet feminines but find Chanel, Opium, Shalimar, et al, too much, give this a</li>
            <li>On my skin, it is very balmy, spicy and rich, like expensive whiskey in a barrel.</li>

            <li> I will say, that it doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as my Eau des Merveilles</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle of this fragrance, it&#x27;s got a really really long staying power and smells heavenly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping to find another one exactly like what I have gotten in the past!</li>
            <li> Either way, lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This review is long overdo because I sniffed this on a woman when I lived in Las Vegas.</li>
            <li> It was wrong, overly sweet, and the lasting power was short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After trying different Hermes fragrances and the sales associate being impatient, I bought another scent.</li>
            <li> but I just returned it because it was dark in color.</li>
            <li> Like a rotting fig tree + a wet pile of green leaves + sun dried cotton laundry + a touch of coconut +  salty sea +man sweat.  </li>
            <li> Slightly spicy, but not in an oriental way, and woody, I&#x27;ve taken to spraying it occassionally on bedlinens when I want to drift off to the scent of summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fake, do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> This one is too fruity, this one is too green.</li>
            <li> I ordered an expensive bottle of perfume that my wife had been dying for.  </li>
            <li> --you can&#x27;t fake an Hermes perfume!  </li>
            <li> I T Y which is just awful, but</li>

            <li> Great product (the wife loves it) plus no transaction problems; makes for good business.  Mandatory words -I don&#x27;t want to type this many, but amazon is making me. Fare thee well, chaps</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s keep this short.  It&#x27;s Hermes, and in spite of the products description on Amazon, it is  Unisex, as per the description on [...]..  Check out the MSRP on [...]. You will  certainly buy it from Amazon. It is an outstanding fragrance.  SOPHISTICATED!!!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this perfume!!  Is a lotion available?</li>
            <li> We already knew this product, it is my wife&#x27;s favorite.  The price and expedited delivery was awesome. Totally exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy! This leaks! Called customer services about it</li>
            <li> Jean Claude Ellena has created another lovely, dry, very wearable fragrance for all of us. When first sprayed on the wrist, the citrus tickles your nose and is swiftly followed by the raisin-y, figgy middle notes. You are left with a mellow cedarwood with traces of mild fruit to enjoy over the next several hours. Un Jardin sur le Nil by Hermes and Jean-Claude remains my top choice but this is a pleasant change of pace. Thank you Amazon for securing the Hermes scents so that we can enjoy a bit of luxury in these hard-pressed times!</li>
            <li> Everything is fine so far,  just need to compare it to the actual scent from Neimanns that I sprayed to insure I have the ReAL THInG!  I try to just buy from Amazon distribution, since  can balk if things aren&#x27;t right.  Noy as comfy with others.  I have another item coming today from another seller...hope all is well with that fragrance.  Raj&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> I live in a politically correct marketplace where people will bark at you if your perfume aggravates their perfume allergies. I like a scent that is sensual and yummy, but is soft enough to keep the perfume police at bay! This is my favorite scent in years.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it has so many of my very favorite scents combined. It&#x27;s a good bit different than I thought it would be, but very nice.  I will say, that it doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as my Eau des Merveilles, I have to use more, and I definitely prefer the Eau des Merveilles, to this scent.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely wear this a lot, and it&#x27;s very different than anything you will smell otherwise.</li>
            <li> It smells different, the color is darker and the scent does not last more than 10 mins.  Please do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> I have always loved Hermes Un Jardin En Mediterranee and have worn it for years. I just purchased another one but I just returned it because it was dark in color. I just didn&#x27;t trust it! I&#x27;m hoping to find another one exactly like what I have gotten in the past!</li>
            <li> This product arrived fast and smells absolutely divine.  I splurged and purchased this one thing for myself for my birthday.  Happy Birthday to me!!!</li>
            <li> This review is long overdo because I sniffed this on a woman when I lived in Las Vegas. She told me it was Hermes but \\&quot;forgot\\&quot; the name of the particular fragrance. I remember it being clean, soft, sweet and somewhat different. The sillage was nice because I wasn&#x27;t too close but I could still smell her. After trying different Hermes fragrances and the sales associate being impatient, I bought another scent. It was wrong, overly sweet, and the lasting power was short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After an interview in Southern California, I walk into Sephora. \\&quot;When did Sephora start carrying Hermes?\\&quot; I wondered, but lo and behold, I tried some scents from the famous French designer. This one is too fruity, this one is too green. And this one smells...(gasp)\\&quot;OH MY! THIS IS IT!\\&quot; The scent I have been looking for. I finally found it! I asked the sales associate for a sample immediately so that I can try it on my skin. Mmmmmmmmmm, it is absolutely wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first put it on, it is sharp. I am guessing this is the bergamot and cedar. On my skin, it is very balmy, spicy and rich, like expensive whiskey in a barrel. Next, the heart is more floral fruity with the fig and white oleander coming out. This stage is probably my favorite. And lastly, the musk and pistachio take their final bow with some warmth and sweetness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to purchase this scent because I feel like it&#x27;s \\&quot;me\\&quot;. It is subdued, sweet, and unique. It is a unisex fragrance but I have yet to smell this on a man. I can&#x27;t wait to wear this when I go shopping to see if I get a reaction because I LOVE the way I smell!</li>
            <li> I adore Un Jardin En Mediterranee by Hermes. I bought this perfume when I have been to Greece for the first time. Since then when I wear Un Jardin  I feel the  breathe of sea, light of sunrays and scent of Mediterranean flowers.  Fresh bergamot breeze and spray of juicy mandarin are replaced by the bright play of floral notes, honey sweet of figs  is set off by slight bitterness of juniper, cedar and cool tranquility of cypress. Un Jardin En Mediterranee by Hermes is something unique, it makes people turn around. It is smell of confidence and tenderness. The perfume is pertinent for business meeting and first date, it suits for day or evening. It possesses by mysterious magnetism, I love every drop of this bouquet, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Fast shipment. Good quality.</li>
            <li> Original and stylish fragrance for the summer! For those who believe in yourself!</li>
            <li> I ordered an expensive bottle of perfume that my wife had been dying for.  This arrived in excellent condition and absolutely was the highlight of her Mother&#x27;s Day!</li>
            <li> Fake, do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle of this fragrance, it&#x27;s got a really really long staying power and smells heavenly. Always gets the attention whenever I wear it.</li>
            <li> Great perfume  product that has a long lasting scent. I bought this as a gift.  I will buy this again.😊😊😊</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife in Paris when it was brand new, before it was released in the US.  She has worn it ever since, probably 90-95% of the time.  I similarly have worn Eau d&#x27;Orange Vert similarly since it was released as Eau d&#x27;Hermes, much longer ago.  Eau d&#x27;Hermes is built on the theme of the classical 1776 Kolnish Wasser - Eau de Cologne, invented by Germans.  The most important part of any fragrance is to use natural ingredients, that&#x27;s why Hermes (and e.g. Guerlain) are so wonderful - they use natural essences, not aromatic chemicals.  Most perfumiers today create semi-synthetic or fully synthetic scents to be cloying, that&#x27;s why elevators smell of a foul-smelling scent that has affinity for your sinus membranes, it&#x27;s pure chemistry. You will notice this right away with a scent such as the aptly named E T E R N I T Y which is just awful, but \\&quot;a chacun - son gout!\\&quot;  Un Jardin En Mediterranee is a more complex scent and longer-lasting due to its composition, but as pure as air on a deserted beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others have aptly described the makeup of the scent itself, decide if it appeals to you, but know from a Trained Chemist and an olfactory savant that this scent is sublime.  Decent for men as well, but iconic for bold, confident ladies.</li>
            <li> Great Price, great perfume!</li>
            <li> It is so refreshing and &amp;#34;young&amp;#34;.  I love the whole &amp;#34;garden&amp;#34; collection. Although it was advertised as suitable for both genders but I think it&#x27;s more for lady though. No matter!  I love it.</li>
            <li> Best price anywhere and I smell delicious!</li>
            <li> I give this 5 stars because I love it and originally purchased it 7 years ago in Morocco.  It is also the best in the Jardin line according to my nose--a melange of fig (base note), cedar, hot pepper, tomato, and Mediterranean herbs.  This perfume is quite pricey in retail stores in the US, but is a great price on Amazon and I got the real deal--you can&#x27;t fake an Hermes perfume!  Note: if you are interested in purchasing this but have never smelled it, try it out in a retail store first.  If you have worn Un Jardin Sur Le Toit, I find it similar but without the green apple base and more hot pepper, thus more interesting and intriguing.  This entire line is very unique and Un Jardin en Mediterranee is a complex fragrance that is not for all, but perfect for moi, who doesn&#x27;t care for women&#x27;s perfume much.</li>
