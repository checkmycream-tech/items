            <li>Great cleanser, AMAZING SMELL, does not dry your skin out.</li>
            <li>I like the Andalou brand; I tried this cleanser, but it doesn&#x27;t clean!  </li>
            <li>It has a light pleasant scent; it&#x27;s creamy yet still cleanses very well.</li>
            <li>my face in the morning, just spray some mineral water, but I would be fine using this in the morning.</li>
            <li>This is a great facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>/&gt;delightfully light and creamy on the skin.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>How can this feel so mild and clean so well?!?  </li>
            <li>Makes my face feel clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li>after I&#x27;ve cleansed with this, and my skin is not red or irritated -- so I&#x27;m thrilled!</li>
            <li>but, rinses clean.  </li>
            <li>This works great on my oily skin even though it&#x27;s supposed to be for dry skin.</li>
            <li>but it also never feels clean.</li>
            <li>I bought this originally from Whole Foods, where it was $4.00 more on sale.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>Regardless of the skin type, the cleanser was good enough for me to go order it again.</li>
            <li>, it smells nicely and has natural</li>

            <li>and my face feels clean and great and yet doesn&#x27;t feel dried out.</li>
            <li>I alternate day and night with the Meyer Creamy Lemon (didnt think I could find better than the Lemon!).</li>
            <li>I guess the probiotic is what makes my skin so calm after washing.  </li>
            <li>I gave it two stars because it ranks very low on ewg and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cause any redness or reactions, or helps calm the rosacea.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite face cleanser I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>The other antioxidant ingredients are probably doing good things as well.  </li>
            <li>I use this with my Clarisonic Mia, but first give myself a nice facial massage and really work this in.</li>
            <li>and this is a very gentle, paraben-free cleanser.</li>
            <li>So glad Andalou offers high quality products at affordable prices.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this facial cleansing lotion on my very sensitive skin for over a year and just love it!</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m well aware of the importance of ingesting them and aiding gut health).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At night I use a makeup cleansing oil first</li>
            <li>I always check the EWG /Cosmetics Database rating, this is a 1; I avoid products rated higher than a 2.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find it locally anymore and am glad Amazon carries it.</li>
            <li>I always love Andalou and I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years!</li>
            <li>Leaves skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Thanks everyone!</li>

            <li>It is helping to clear up my adult acne!</li>
            <li>I get little acne, but it did help with the huge pimples I used to get.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t dry my skin like most other cleansers.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft with no itching.</li>

            <li>It makes your skin feel so soft and supple.</li>
            <li>This is one of the Andalou products I really like and use regularly.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for the solvent action as well as the emollients included.  </li>
            <li>The only problem is that it really doesn&#x27;t remove mascara.  </li>
            <li>but it definitely doesn&#x27;t clean well enough to use at night before bed, especially if you wear makeup.</li>
            <li>I do not use waterproof mascara and it usually comes off easily.  </li>

            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s pretty useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A lot of cleansers say they&#x27;re not drying, but I find them to be drying for me (I&#x27;m 62 years old, blonde, with a peachy-ruddy complexion).  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it. Makes my face feel clean and smooth.  So glad Andalou offers high quality products at affordable prices. This company doesn&#x27;t test on animals and I trust putting this on my skin. Andalou has replaced my Arbonne products.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite face cleanser I&#x27;ve used so far. The texture is more like cream than soap and doesn&#x27;t lather. I was skeptical at first but afterward my skin felt so clean and soft. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin like some other cleansers I&#x27;ve used so I don&#x27;t find it necessary to slather on moisturizer. I love the subtle apricot scent it leaves on my skin. This one is a winner. I&#x27;m looking forward to using more of their products.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser--light, doesn&#x27;t dry skin, heavenly scent...</li>
            <li> I bought this at Whole Foods but can no longer find it there. I absolutely love this cleanser and am so happy to find it on Amazon.  It smells wonderful and cleans off all makeup and dirt.( my 14 year old daughter used it to clean off Halloween makeup and did not break out her skin).  Leaves my skin smooth and soft not dry like a lot of cleansers but, rinses clean.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I had read some promising information recently regarding probiotics and skin, and so when I noticed this cleanser at my local Whole Foods I picked some up, and am I ever glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive rosacea prone skin, that is also aging (past 50), and very interested in health and beauty, and low toxicity products and consider myself pretty up to date and knowledgeable about skin care, but the idea of probiotics topically was new to me (I&#x27;m well aware of the importance of ingesting them and aiding gut health).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel I&#x27;ve found a holy grail product in this cleanser. After only one use I noticed my skin seemed more &#x27;&#x27;calmed down&#x27;&#x27; than usual (not as red and irritated).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using this more as a TREATMENT than a cleanser. At night I use a makeup cleansing oil first (Boscia make up break up, or other cleansing oil) to remove makeup, then I apply this and leave it on for a few minutes before rinsing off. I typically don&#x27;t &#x27;&#x27;wash&#x27;&#x27; my face in the morning, just spray some mineral water, but I would be fine using this in the morning. I don&#x27;t think overwashing ones face is a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very glad I found out about this product and line. I&#x27;ve seen it in the health food type stores for years and just never tried it before.</li>
            <li> How can this feel so mild and clean so well?!?  I don&#x27;t know, but it&#x27;s got me looking into the other Andalou products, which I&#x27;ll begin to start trying as my other products run out. This cleanser isn&#x27;t oily-feeling, but it isn&#x27;t drying, either.  A lot of cleansers say they&#x27;re not drying, but I find them to be drying for me (I&#x27;m 62 years old, blonde, with a peachy-ruddy complexion).  I guess the probiotic is what makes my skin so calm after washing.  The other antioxidant ingredients are probably doing good things as well.  Who knows?  All I know is my pores instantly are a lot cleaner after I&#x27;ve cleansed with this, and my skin is not red or irritated -- so I&#x27;m thrilled!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to spend too much time fussing with my skincare routine so this really fits the bill for me. I would say I have normal to dry skin, by the way. This smells good, feels nice on my skin, and cleans well. I don&#x27;t have that tight, dried out feeling on my face afterward either. Really good stuff. The only cleaner I&#x27;ll use from now on.</li>
            <li> Wish I&#x27;d found this years ago. I only use a couple of dots of this cleanser and my face feels clean and great and yet doesn&#x27;t feel dried out. I&#x27;m really loving this company&#x27;s products. My daughter and a friend are now using them too at my recommendation. I&#x27;ve just ordered my third bottle of the cleanser.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for a morning cleanser but it definitely doesn&#x27;t clean well enough to use at night before bed, especially if you wear makeup. It&#x27;s smells great and it does leave your skin moisturized, however I don&#x27;t see myself purchasing this product again. I will however continue to find a cleanser in their product line because I love their age defying moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE the smell of this cleansing gel! I bought it for my mom, but I tried using  it while she stays at my house. Regardless of the skin type, the cleanser was good enough for me to go order it again. My mom says that she likes it, too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a cleanser with probiotics in it. This works great on my oily skin even though it&#x27;s supposed to be for dry skin. It is helping to clear up my adult acne! I&#x27;ve been using it for about one month.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase!! Five stars!</li>
            <li> I love Andalou products.</li>
            <li> Great for gently cleansing your face and great non-drying.</li>
            <li> Love the way this feels and cleans! I get compliments on my skin all the time!</li>
            <li> I am very fickle, picky and do not want to spend a fortune on skin care products.  I rarely buy the same product twice. I always check the EWG /Cosmetics Database rating, this is a 1; I avoid products rated higher than a 2. This cleanser is perfect for winter. It has a light pleasant scent; it&#x27;s creamy yet still cleanses very well. It leaves my skin soft with no itching. My skin is combo but gets quite dry in the winter. I have been using it for several years and plan to continue. I can&#x27;t find it locally anymore and am glad Amazon carries it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it is a great product, but I prefer the way my skin looks after using the lemon cleanser.  The consistency is more like a lotion than a cleanser.  I still think Andalou is one of the best lines out there.</li>
            <li> I always love Andalou and I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years! It leaves the skin so refreshed and soft and I love it!</li>
            <li> This is a great facial cleanser. Nice smell, gentle feel on the face. Removes make-up well. Doesn&#x27;t burn eyes. I will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> I use this at my Day Spa and the clients love the&lt;br /&gt;fragrance. They often ask to purchase it just&lt;br /&gt;because they love the fragrance. It&#x27;s also&lt;br /&gt;delightfully light and creamy on the skin.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I did not care for this product. I had been using the mad hippie cream cleanser and didn&#x27;t feel it was cleaning well enough and after reading so many good reviews here and elsewhere I had to try it. Well, I received it today and I decided to give it a try immediately. I had no makeup on my face just some antioxidant oil that I had used last night. I didn&#x27;t feel that it cleaned at all as i felt a gummy residue on my face as I washing and immediately after. I couldn&#x27;t tell for sure so I did a test. I put a tarte primer and tarte foundation on the back of my hand and let it set for about 10 minutes. I then washed it with this cleanser. What I found was that the cleanser just slid around the back of my hand. It remained white in color showing that it wasn&#x27;t picking up any of the pigments in the foundation. After I rinsed my hand I ran a cotton ball across the back of my hand and found that it was saturated in makeup. None of the foundation had been removed. I tried the same test with the mad hippie and found that it did in fact remove some of the make up but not all of it. The cleanser changed from white to a light peach as it picked up some of the pigment. But it didn&#x27;t rinse away very well. When I tried the cotton ball test I could see a thin layer had been left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I also discovered that as time passed my face started to burn. When I realized that the remnants left behind from this cleanser was irritating my face I decided I couldn&#x27;t use it. I gave it two stars because it ranks very low on ewg and it smells amazing. Other than that it&#x27;s pretty useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you take a look at the ingredients in both of these cleansers It makes perfect sense that they wouldn&#x27;t work. You&#x27;re essentially washing your face with lotion. There is a reason we don&#x27;t wash our faces with lotion. Because it doesn&#x27;t work! It leaves a residue behind and if it can leave anything behind it&#x27;s not taking anything or very little off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of now the best cleanser I have found is the frownies ph balanced cleanser. I don&#x27;t know why but for whatever reason it doesn&#x27;t irritate or dry out my face as bad as most cleansers do but it&#x27;s still not perfect for my dry skin. So the search continues!

            <li> Leaves skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> makes my skin feel and look great. I love all of the andalou products. couldn&#x27;t be happier</li>
            <li> Very sensitive, oily, acne prone skin. This didn&#x27;t irritate my skin (win!) but it also never feels clean. I get little acne, but it did help with the huge pimples I used to get.</li>
            <li> Nothing special. Left my face tight feeling. Won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> Best face wash I&#x27;ve found. I have very sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate it or dry it out</li>
            <li> Great cleanser, AMAZING SMELL, does not dry your skin out. Feels like washing with lotion, which might be off putting to some. It really does the job, though. I have loved all the products from Andalou and am hooked!</li>
            <li> So far so good. Smells great, nice texture, seems gentle. Time will tell.</li>
            <li> I love Andalou products for many reasons. I use this with my Clarisonic Mia, but first give myself a nice facial massage and really work this in. I alternate day and night with the Meyer Creamy Lemon (didnt think I could find better than the Lemon!). This is completely different, and I must say how plump and moisturized my face looks as soon as I am done with this cleanser! My wrinkles (fine lines and mature lines) appear less visible. I am very pleased with this and almost all of the Andalou products. 45 years young, olive complexion. I did not buy this online, but wanted to tell others how well this worked as Amazon Reviews are my first stop when considering trying something new. Thanks everyone!</li>
            <li> I love this facial wash. It makes your skin feel so soft and supple. I do like this and I like a scrub also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this facial cleansing lotion on my very sensitive skin for over a year and just love it! It doesn&#x27;t cause any redness or reactions, or helps calm the rosacea. It also doesn&#x27;t dry my skin like most other cleansers. Does a good job removing make up too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, it smells nicely and has natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this face wash.  I struggled with perioral dermatitis for a long time and conventional soaps and face washes would aggravate it terribly.  This is NOT a normal face wash.  It does not foam (no SLS), and you have to rub it in to make it an effective remover of makeup.  It smells awesome and I really do think the probiotics helped to calm the rash on my face.  I have continued to order this product for the last 3 years and don&#x27;t see myself stopping any time soon.</li>
            <li> Smells great. My skin looks more healthy too. I use this with the SFP 15 mosturize</li>
            <li> WARNING!!! If you buy it and it breaks out your face YOU CANNOT RETURN IT!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$10 or more down the drain.</li>
            <li> This is one of the Andalou products I really like and use regularly.  I have really sensitive, dry skin and this is a very gentle, paraben-free cleanser.</li>
            <li> Not a cleanser leaves skin oily and unclean</li>
            <li> I bought this originally from Whole Foods, where it was $4.00 more on sale. This is a great product. I only started using it after a sunburn to cleanse my skin without oversrying it, but found that has helped clear my acne! I would post a before/after, but I didn&#x27;t even think to take a before. Absolutely great gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li> Nice product for my sensitive skin. I use it daily. I love Andalou products, just wish they had some bigger packing.</li>
            <li> Ver unhappy. this is not cleanse and it certainly does not take off makeup. a cleanser should at least take off foundation. I am NOT happy with this line</li>
            <li> I like the Andalou brand; I tried this cleanser, but it doesn&#x27;t clean!  I wanted a gentle cleanser, and this is gentle...so that&#x27;s why it gets 3 stars instead of 1.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the solvent action as well as the emollients included.  It smells great and leaves my face (dry skin) feeling very clean and soft.  The only problem is that it really doesn&#x27;t remove mascara.  I do not use waterproof mascara and it usually comes off easily.  However, this will only remove if you rub it on, work on it and WIPE off.  Bottle says to rub on and rinse off which is what I do but for mascara you will need to tissue off the mascara residue.  But I do like it.</li>
            <li> I love all Andalou products.  This cleanser is nicely hydrating.</li>
