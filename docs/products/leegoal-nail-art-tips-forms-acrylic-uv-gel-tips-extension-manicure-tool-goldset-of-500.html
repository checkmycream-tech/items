            <li> I love these forms they are thick and easy to apply and remove. Makes my job much easier! They were here very quickly</li>
            <li> Arrived just in time. Was getting worried that wouldn&#x27;t get here in time. The roll was much bigger than expected . True 500 sticker. EXACTLY like salon quality . Very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> Great for airbrushing designs makes for a very easy clean up not just for acrylics</li>
            <li> Item was just as described the forms do unstick easily but that is very common with nail art forms</li>
            <li> The price and quality of these forms was a surprise.  I have seen the same product in a store for quite a bit more. They work beautifully!</li>
            <li> Price is worth the wait. Surdy, good adhesive, structurally sound. Tip* (if you are applying acrylic nails, if you use too much liquid monomer it loosens the forms &#x27;hold&#x27;)</li>
            <li> Huge role and the stickers are very sturdy and thick.  Happy with purchase.  Ordered on December 29th received January 4th.</li>
            <li> These forms work very well.  Easy to apply and easy to remove.</li>
            <li> I am new to using nail forms so this is the first 1 I&#x27;ve tried and it was pretty easy to use these stickers and I did pretty good</li>
            <li> I was afraid to try using forms but these work great!  I should probably use clear ones for gel, but these work fine.</li>
            <li> It was going great till I was like 2 minutes going in on the nail. The stickiness to it is ridiculous!</li>

            <li> Good choice because I saw in CVS exactly the same form and was $15.99 ! :O Thank you !</li>
            <li> Exactly what was expected.</li>
            <li> not very helpful....i thought it may help on the sides of my nails but it is strictly for form at the tops of your nails. if you just want to extend, i am sure they are fine...</li>
            <li> THEY DON&#x27;T STICK VERY WELL AND WHEN STICKING TOGETHER THEY COME APART WHICH MAKES PUTTING ON ACRYLIC DIFFICULT IF IF YOU HOLD THEM DOWN THEY CAUSE THE ACRYLIC TO LIFT WITH IT. HAD TO ORDER DIFFERENT ONES</li>
