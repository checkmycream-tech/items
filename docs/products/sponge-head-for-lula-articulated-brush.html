            <li>This system is a really great idea, and I am SOOOO relieved to find it here on Amazon!!</li>
            <li>It works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>works great!  </li>
            <li>and this sponge is another great design.</li>
            <li>These sponge heads are great</li>
            <li>Otherwise it is a nice bathing accessory for those that need a lot of help like me!</li>
            <li>Nice product but for what you pay for it</li>
            <li>Excellent for scrubbing back.</li>
            <li>I love this for applying my body soap and conditioner</li>
            <li>The sponge deteriorates very quickly.</li>
            <li>easy to replace on handle.  </li>
            <li>sponge for back and lower leg and foot, non-absorbent lotion applicator and pumice stone for heels in hot summer weather  excellent purchase!</li>
            <li>The brush that comes with product is fine.</li>
            <li>Fastens well to handle and now is working fine.</li>
            <li>I think you are getting ripped off because all it is is cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>great for washing your back</li>
            <li>It is soft and is a good size for what I want it for.  </li>
            <li>At first, it seemed great, but during fourth shower, it came apart and fell off.</li>
            <li>Came off first time I used it!  </li>
            <li>I chucked the whole thing in the garbage that day!  </li>
            <li>Needed to Gorrilla glue it after first use.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to most anyone - more so for anyone with limited ability to reach certain areas like feet and back.</li>
            <li>I found it insufficient for exfoliation, however, but it is fine for regular bathing.</li>
            <li>It is not broken and can still be used, it is just designed for leisurely bathing and that is all.    </li>
            <li>I really just wanted the brush, so I got this option.  </li>
            <li>It wouldn&#x27;t cut into their profit margin THAT much to use sufficient bonding material.</li>
            <li>The last one peeled off the very day I put it on the handle!!!</li>
            <li>The original brush head will work for my purpose, but I may try the pumice stone next.</li>
            <li>excellent product, just make sure that you get the one that is glued to the back of the base of the brush, and not the one with the holes in it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I only needed this brush for a short period of time!  </li>
            <li>I love this lula long extended handle and the sponge reaches those places that need extra attention when bathing.  </li>
            <li>better be careful just a little too much pressure and it will snap and break as mine did.</li>
            <li>Wet it, rub a little soap on it, and it&#x27;s just coarse enough to duplicate what a good wash cloth does.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made and a waste of money!</li>

            <li> but they don&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> I was having hip replacement surgery- needed long handled brush &amp; lotion applicator and punice stone for surgery leg.  </li>
            <li> Good sponge quality however not glued well to base.</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t be beat - the articulated handle works extremely well for scrubbing under your feet and on your back.  </li>
            <li> My main problem is that you have to be careful when you are cleaning the sponge because it comes off easily from its base.  </li>
            <li> I like the rough pattern and the materials used to manufacture it.</li>
            <li> I bought several replacement sponges, but they would promptly peel off of the plastic within a few uses.</li>
            <li> Could use some heavy glue to keep this sucker in tact when reaching for tough areas to clean!</li>
            <li> I also use the other heads for bathing.  </li>
            <li> One has to be very careful detaching it from the handle -- there is no way to get it off the handle without straining the sponge and its glue except by holding it face down and hitting the backing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> In looking at it, I noticed that there were two little dabs of glue holding it to the base - obviously NOT ENOUGH to hold it to the base long term.  </li>
            <li> Sponge started disintegrating after only two or three showers, and started coming off the base to which it was glued.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing and annoying to me.</li>
            <li> If you rub with this sponge head too vigorously it will fall off its base.</li>
            <li> Then, the sponge came off of its base the 5th time I used it.  </li>
            <li> The wand this flimsy and the sponge is worthless!</li>
            <li> Terrible, the brush falls off after one use.</li>

            <li> and this sponge is another great design. I found it insufficient for exfoliation, however, but it is fine for regular bathing. I like the rough pattern and the materials used to manufacture it. If you rub with this sponge head too vigorously it will fall off its base. It is not broken and can still be used, it is just designed for leisurely bathing and that is all.    The original brush head will work for my purpose, but I may try the pumice stone next. This system is a really great idea, and I am SOOOO relieved to find it here on Amazon!!</li>
            <li> These sponge heads are great but they don&#x27;t last too long. And as for the handle you attach it to you better be careful just a little too much pressure and it will snap and break as mine did. Nice product but for what you pay for it I think you are getting ripped off because all it is is cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> I used this sponge head for putting lotion on my feet and lower legs.  It works perfectly.  I also use the other heads for bathing.  It can&#x27;t be beat - the articulated handle works extremely well for scrubbing under your feet and on your back.  I would recommend this to most anyone - more so for anyone with limited ability to reach certain areas like feet and back.</li>
            <li> works great!  I was having hip replacement surgery- needed long handled brush &amp; lotion applicator and punice stone for surgery leg.  Lulu system had all I needed - longer handle that could be angled if needed, sponge for back and lower leg and foot, non-absorbent lotion applicator and pumice stone for heels in hot summer weather  excellent purchase!</li>
            <li> One has to be very careful detaching it from the handle -- there is no way to get it off the handle without straining the sponge and its glue except by holding it face down and hitting the backing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I only needed this brush for a short period of time!  The sponge deteriorates very quickly. I bought several replacement sponges, but they would promptly peel off of the plastic within a few uses. The last one peeled off the very day I put it on the handle!!!

            <li> Came off first time I used it!  Cheaply made and a waste of money! The brush that comes with product is fine.</li>
            <li> Good sponge quality however not glued well to base. Needed to Gorrilla glue it after first use. Fastens well to handle and now is working fine.</li>

            <li> Excellent for scrubbing back.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these and they both fell apart after one use.</li>
            <li> excellent product, just make sure that you get the one that is glued to the back of the base of the brush, and not the one with the holes in it.</li>
            <li> I bought the handle that this brush head goes on it had a head that was part sponge and part brush.  I really just wanted the brush, so I got this option.  It soaks up and then dispenses the bath oil I like to apply in the shower.  It is soft and is a good size for what I want it for.  Basically, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;-&#x3D;-&#x3D;-&#x3D;-&#x3D;-&#x3D;-&#x3D;-&#x3D;-&#x3D;-&#x3D;-&#x3D;-&#x3D;-&#x3D;-&#x3D;-&#x3D;-&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I wrote above was my reaction after I got the sponge and started using it.  Then, the sponge came off of its base the 5th time I used it.  In looking at it, I noticed that there were two little dabs of glue holding it to the base - obviously NOT ENOUGH to hold it to the base long term.  It wouldn&#x27;t cut into their profit margin THAT much to use sufficient bonding material.</li>
            <li> I love this for applying my body soap and conditioner</li>

            <li> Terrible, the brush falls off after one use.</li>
            <li> easy to replace on handle.  great for washing your back&lt;br /&gt;wish it came in purple, my fav color over all</li>
            <li> At first, it seemed great, but during fourth shower, it came apart and fell off. Very disappointing and annoying to me.</li>
            <li> Sponge started disintegrating after only two or three showers, and started coming off the base to which it was glued.</li>
