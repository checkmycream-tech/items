            <li>but if you&#x27;re looking for something that smells nice...</li>
            <li>The product is great, but the cap breaks so quickly.....</li>
            <li>good, doesn&#x27;t smell as strongly as some mention</li>
            <li>The hemp lotion is the best I&#x27;ve ever used to keep my hands and ankles soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE the earthy smell and</li>
            <li>I love the fact that when you rub it on your hands it dries within minutes and you can use your phone without leaving any grease marks.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>I bought it when my daughter was in the NICU because scrubbing in so many times a day for weeks and weeks is sure to make your hands crack and bleed.</li>
            <li>I asked the girl at the Body Shop for the most moisturizing/healing cream they had and this is what she recommended.</li>
            <li>This is not some frou frou &amp;#34;hand lotion&amp;#34;, it is a botanical product meant to do a specific job so do not expect a wonderful scent.</li>
            <li>In the winter it cracks and most lotions irritate my skin, instead of heal them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>no matter how many times I wash my hands.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>love what it does for my hands.</li>
            <li>The scent is not the over powering floral or perfumey smell that you get with most lotions.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>and I liked it so much I had to have some of my own.</li>
            <li>I use it on my now bald head &amp; it&#x27;s so great &amp; keeping my skin moist &amp; irritation free - highly recommended</li>
            <li>though I wash my hands often i could still feel my hands smooth and hydrated:)</li>
            <li>size is ideal to carry around in a bag, while I prefer the bigger size ([[ASIN:B001E07PSA Body Shop Hemp Hand Protector 3.3 Oz.]]) for home use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very earthy - think of a forrest floor after a good rain.  </li>
            <li>But indeed the product is very good and makes your hands super soft.</li>
            <li>It comes in a metal tube that dispenses easily.</li>
            <li>and I had to wear gloves to touch anything because the skin split so easily.</li>
            <li>I bought more for his birthday since he liked it so much.</li>
            <li>this is such a great product - my &amp;#34;x&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I could actually stop wearing rubber gloves for everything which was very nice.  </li>
            <li>Works well as described, however has a unique odor that might not seem pleasant for someone next to you.</li>
            <li>Works great on my consistently dry hands.</li>
            <li>if your suffering from dry skin issues - but - it does have natural hemp oils which do put out a great smell - so - may not be great if your sensitive to hemp oil -</li>
            <li>Best hand cream ever for extra dry hands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but well worth</li>
            <li>A bit thick, but absorbs well, nice fragrance for women or men, herbal and warm.</li>
            <li>but if your not allergic - great dry skin solution - 4 stars cause it&#x27;s a weenie tub for a fairly high price ...</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly without feeling greasy or sticky and you don&#x27;t need to use very much at a time.  </li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s helped relieve the irritation which she suffered trying to wear clothing on her upper body &amp; has a great lasting smell - hemp - I personally love the smell of this particular element -</li>
            <li>I like this product very much.</li>
            <li>I need to learn not to order stuff like this online without sniffing it first.</li>
            <li>I was definitely willing to overlook this because of how well it works</li>
            <li>This is a good balmy lotion for cracked, dry hands and elbows.</li>
            <li>you have aversions to strong scents (and this smells like patchouli mixed with rotting garbage)</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>For the price, I expected this to be better than Burt&#x27;s Bees or my Hoofer&#x27;s Choice cream.</li>
            <li>just as much yet my cuts were healing.</li>
            <li>I have continued to use it and it doesn&#x27;t take much to provide the protective barrier</li>
            <li>Best cream for cold weather.</li>
            <li>It gives a really good protective barrier that can hold up to extreme temps, wind, and multiple hand-washings.  </li>
            <li>stuff is pretty thick and has a earthy smell suitable for both men and women.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>However, it is highly emollient and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>but this is the same exact scent as the original, larger bottle.</li>
            <li>very moisturizing for super dry hands.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your hands so soft!</li>
            <li>I hesitated deviating from the large bottle since the butter isn&#x27;t the same scent</li>
            <li>A young co-worker with red hair &amp; VERY sensitive skin let me try some of this</li>
            <li>This actually kept my skin together and kept new cuts from forming.  </li>
            <li>This cream keeps them soft all day even after several hand washes.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, dry skin.</li>
            <li>This is the only one that works for me in the high dry desert.&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li>It really keeps hands moist and repairs minor cuts due to dryness.</li>

            <li> I had tried product after product in an attempt to heel hands that hands were so dry and cracked they were bleeding due to the drying effects of alcohol hand sanitizers and frequent hand washing (I am a nurse.)</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I would recommend this for someone who works in a medical setting and washes hands/scrubs in a lot or someone who lives in a dry climate.&lt;br /&gt;-Not</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only thing that will take a dry, red patch of skin and heal it completely within a few days.</li>
            <li> I have tried cheap and expensive hand crime.</li>
            <li> It smells earthy which I tend to like and does wonders for dry skin..</li>
            <li> I bought a small tube of this on my first visit to NYC this past fall.  </li>
            <li> The lotions is thick and rubs in smoothly and makes your hands super soft but has an absolutely horrific smell.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough to carry in your purse.</li>
            <li> I washed my hands due to the smell of the lotion.</li>
            <li> Little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> The lotion itself is nice but the smell is so horrible that I only used it once</li>
            <li> and I no longer had actively bleeding cuts on my hands.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a slightly medicinal, slightly green or earthy smell.  </li>
            <li> I am a flight attendant and my hands get extremely dry when I&#x27;m flying, with the dry air and washing my hands constantly with that horrible airplane soap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It feels a little greasy if you put a lot on.&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first the odor was tough to get used to, not that is is bad but just different from the fruity or flowery smell of other hand creams.  </li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t go to waste.  </li>
            <li> a majour children&#x27;s hospital hospital in Canada turned me onto this cream - it&#x27;s helped out one of our friends whom developed some weird rash which doc&#x27;s are still trying to figure out - but this cream has been a god send to her</li>
            <li> We live in wi very cold and dry here</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin that gets even worse in the winters.  </li>
            <li> I need to wash my hands often, and this product has done wonders in the past two winters.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, and the smell is AWFUL.</li>
            <li> My husband had horrible rough cracking skin, first lotion to fix problem.</li>
            <li> This product is expensive for the amount in the tube, but I have found it invaluable in keeping my hands from cracking and splitting in the winter.  </li>
            <li> I use it at night before going to bed without fail.</li>
            <li> I actually wish the hemp smelled like pot, versus the horrible medicinal smell it has!</li>
            <li> The lotion have a bad smell (in my opinion)...</li>
            <li> Even my boyfriend asked me why I smelled so bad</li>
            <li> So yea, it was bad.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great feel and smell.  Works great on my consistently dry hands.</li>
            <li> Awesome product with a pleasant smell</li>
            <li> The lotion itself is nice but the smell is so horrible that I only used it once, I&#x27;m going to see if I can give it away so it doesn&#x27;t go to waste.  I&#x27;m done with Body Shop hand creams, why do they scent them to oblivion?  Even my boyfriend asked me why I smelled so bad and he NEVER comments on scents--even if I&#x27;m wearing a nice perfume!  So yea, it was bad.  GAG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have aversions to strong scents (and this smells like patchouli mixed with rotting garbage) skip this one.  I need to learn not to order stuff like this online without sniffing it first.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! I bought it when my daughter was in the NICU because scrubbing in so many times a day for weeks and weeks is sure to make your hands crack and bleed. I asked the girl at the Body Shop for the most moisturizing/healing cream they had and this is what she recommended. It healed my hands up nicely and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things to know:&lt;br /&gt;-It does not smell good. I was definitely willing to overlook this because of how well it works but if you&#x27;re looking for something that smells nice...This isn&#x27;t for you.&lt;br /&gt;-It feels a little greasy if you put a lot on.&lt;br /&gt;-It works well as a spot treatment on rough/dry patches.&lt;br /&gt;-I would recommend this for someone who works in a medical setting and washes hands/scrubs in a lot or someone who lives in a dry climate.&lt;br /&gt;-Not for just regular moisturizing, this is the big one.</li>
            <li> Really good hand product.</li>
            <li> great formula I just couldn&#x27;t get over the smell</li>
            <li> It is the only product that heals cracks on my fingers and toes.  I use it on my lips as well.</li>
            <li> The best hand lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I hesitated deviating from the large bottle since the butter isn&#x27;t the same scent but this is the same exact scent as the original, larger bottle. I can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff.  It smells earthy which I tend to like and does wonders for dry skin.. it&#x27;s the only lotion use on a regular basis and I keep this one in my purse.</li>
            <li> BEST best hand crème ever</li>
            <li> Works well as described, however has a unique odor that might not seem pleasant for someone next to you. I don’t mind it, but I do get some stares when I apply it sitting next to a stranger!</li>
            <li> I use the The Body Shop Hemp Hand Protector daily. I have a tube a home and at work. The Hemp Hand Protector keeps my hands moisturized and I am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> This is the best hand protector I have used. We live in wi very cold and dry here I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I have tried cheap and expensive hand crime. This is the only one that works for me in the high dry desert.&lt;br /&gt;Wish Amazon would sell it in the big tube.</li>
            <li> A young co-worker with red hair &amp; VERY sensitive skin let me try some of this and I liked it so much I had to have some of my own.</li>
            <li> smells and feels great</li>
            <li> I discovered The body Shop&#x27;s Hemp hand protector 8 years ago. I had tried product after product in an attempt to heel hands that hands were so dry and cracked they were bleeding due to the drying effects of alcohol hand sanitizers and frequent hand washing (I am a nurse.) This is not some frou frou &amp;#34;hand lotion&amp;#34;, it is a botanical product meant to do a specific job so do not expect a wonderful scent. Just know it WILL do it&#x27;s job. It not only helped heal and moisturize my hands it is also does what it says... protects them from further damage.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, dry skin. In the winter it cracks and most lotions irritate my skin, instead of heal them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only moisturizer that works for me (and I&#x27;ve tried them all). It&#x27;s the only thing that will take a dry, red patch of skin and heal it completely within a few days. I apply a liberal amount several times a day and let my skin absorb it without rubbing it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is pretty thick and has a earthy smell suitable for both men and women. It comes in a metal tube that dispenses easily. It leaves my hands silky, and not sticky.&lt;br /&gt;This size is ideal to carry around in a bag, while I prefer the bigger size ([[ASIN:B001E07PSA Body Shop Hemp Hand Protector 3.3 Oz.]]) for home use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s vegetarian, fair trade, and against animal testing. It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Woo hoo ... this is such a great product - my &amp;#34;x&amp;#34; wife whom is a nurse @ a majour children&#x27;s hospital hospital in Canada turned me onto this cream - it&#x27;s helped out one of our friends whom developed some weird rash which doc&#x27;s are still trying to figure out - but this cream has been a god send to her - it&#x27;s helped relieve the irritation which she suffered trying to wear clothing on her upper body &amp; has a great lasting smell - hemp - I personally love the smell of this particular element - I use it on my now bald head &amp; it&#x27;s so great &amp; keeping my skin moist &amp; irritation free - highly recommended if your suffering from dry skin issues - but - it does have natural hemp oils which do put out a great smell - so - may not be great if your sensitive to hemp oil - but if your not allergic - great dry skin solution - 4 stars cause it&#x27;s a weenie tub for a fairly high price ...</li>
            <li> This truly is a hand protector. My sister bought it for me at a point where my hands were cut and bleeding and I had to wear gloves to touch anything because the skin split so easily. I started using the hand protector and within 2 days my cuts were healing and I no longer had actively bleeding cuts on my hands. I had not changed anything in my routine so my hands were still in water just as much yet my cuts were healing. This actually kept my skin together and kept new cuts from forming.  It is really amazing.  I could actually stop wearing rubber gloves for everything which was very nice.  I have continued to use it and it doesn&#x27;t take much to provide the protective barrier no matter how many times I wash my hands.  I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have eczema on my hands and this is the only product that helps with the redness, flaking and itching.&lt;br /&gt;It has a slightly medicinal, slightly green or earthy smell.  Some may not like the scent, I don&#x27;t mind it and&lt;br /&gt;I love what it does for my hands.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin that gets even worse in the winters.  The hemp lotion is the best I&#x27;ve ever used to keep my hands and ankles soft and moisturized.  It gives a really good protective barrier that can hold up to extreme temps, wind, and multiple hand-washings.  It absorbs quickly without feeling greasy or sticky and you don&#x27;t need to use very much at a time.  The scent is not the over powering floral or perfumey smell that you get with most lotions.  It&#x27;s very earthy - think of a forrest floor after a good rain.  which means its great for men as well.  :)</li>
            <li> The lotions is thick and rubs in smoothly and makes your hands super soft but has an absolutely horrific smell.  I tried to keep it on and after about 10 minutes I washed my hands due to the smell of the lotion.</li>
            <li> My husband had horrible rough cracking skin, first lotion to fix problem. I bought more for his birthday since he liked it so much.</li>
            <li> Only downside is you smell like rope. Best lotion and never greasy or oil, just amazing and nothing else feels like it. Little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Best cream for cold weather.</li>
            <li> This is a good balmy lotion for cracked, dry hands and elbows. A bit thick, but absorbs well, nice fragrance for women or men, herbal and warm.</li>
            <li> The best on the market. Surgeons use it. It really keeps hands moist and repairs minor cuts due to dryness.</li>
            <li> good, doesn&#x27;t smell as strongly as some mention</li>
            <li> I have used the product for quite a while will buy larger tubes next time</li>
